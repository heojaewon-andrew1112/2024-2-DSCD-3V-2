All towels provided.\\nOur double bed was quite comfortable with clean linen and 2 pillows.\\nWe were 3 floors up and could not hear traffic noise from our window, No balcony.\\nIf you are visiting for 23 nights this would be perfectly adequate as a base, reasonably priced and good location for sightseeing. Very nice and helpful staff.  They were great about everything and very helpful.  Even tolerated by bad French attempts.  The location is excellent.  Near the Eiffel tower, dining, the metro.  And across the street from a laundromat if you need to do laundry for a longer stay.  The rooms are small, but that is to be expected for the location and price point.  If you are staying in Paris to see the sights and not the inside of your room, you will be fine.  Breakfast was perfect for the occasion. Rooms are of course on the small side, but that's typical of Paris. Bathroom is a bit dated, but has all of the necessary bits. It would be nice to have at least one more hook in the bathroom and to fit another shelf in somehow since there isn't much of a vanity, but these are small complaints.  Excellent location, wonderful staff. Would stay again. Great location, superbe service. Employees are super nice and useful.\\nBreakfast is reasonably priced and good.\\nMain issues we had\\n1. Noise inside the hotel, acceptable but could be better.\\n2. Rooms are really small.\\n3. Corridors and stairs are small, and always with cleaning materials.\\n\\nExcellent for a night or two. After that, it becomes super annoying. I recently had the pleasure of staying at a hotel conveniently located near the Eiffel Tower, and I must say it exceeded my expectations in many ways. The location alone is a significant highlightbeing just a short walk away from one of the world's most iconic landmarks made exploring Paris incredibly easy and enjoyable.\\n\\nThe staff at the hotel were exceptional. From the moment we checked in, they were welcoming, attentive, and always ready to assist with any requests or questions. Their warm hospitality truly enhanced our stay, making us feel right at home in the heart of Paris.\\n\\nOur room was another standout feature. It was impeccably clean and wellmaintained, providing a comfortable and relaxing environment after a day of sightseeing. The amenities were modern and thoughtful, ensuring we had everything we needed for a pleasant stay.\\n\\nIn addition to its proximity to the Eiffel Tower, the hotel is also conveniently located near several grocery stores and a variety of restaurants. This made it incredibly easy to grab a quick bite or stock up on essentials. Whether we were in the mood for a casual meal or a fine dining experience, we had plenty of excellent options just steps away.\\n\\nOverall, this hotel is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to stay close to the Eiffel Tower while enjoying topnotch service and clean, comfortable accommodations. The added convenience of nearby groceries and dining options makes it an even more attractive option for travelers. I highly recommend it and look forward to staying here again on my next visit to Paris.\",\n          \"Recently stayed at this hotel and felt compelled to leave a review. The staff was so kind, friendly, and helpful. We stayed in a superior room and while it was small, there was still room for all of our purchases. Daily Housekeeping also did a great job. Locationwise, this hotel was perfect for a first time visitor to Paris and was very accessible for flagging down a cab. Def recommend!! I traveled here with my mother and sister. My mother and I shared a junior suite and my sister used a deluxe single room. By American hotel chain standards the rooms may seem small but they met our needs for size, were charming and had many amenities.\\n\\nBeds were very comfortable. Bathroom amenities were excellent. Service was very friendly. We were very well cared for! Breakfast was included for our stay and the buffet was lovely.\\n\\nWe've enjoyed every minute! Nestled in the heart of Paris, Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne is a true gem that exceeds expectations. From the moment I stepped inside, I was enveloped in an atmosphere of beauty and charm. Despite its modest size, the hotel exudes elegance and sophistication, with every detail meticulously curated to perfection.\\n\\nThe impeccable service provided by the staff further elevated my experience. Their warmth and attentiveness made me feel truly valued as a guest, and their dedication to ensuring my comfort and satisfaction was unparalleled.\\n\\nLocationwise, Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne couldn't be better situated. Its prime position allowed me to easily explore the iconic landmarks and vibrant streets of Paris, making it the ideal base for my adventures in the city of lights.\\n\\nWhat truly sets this hotel apart is the exceptional value it offers. Despite its high quality and luxurious ambiance, the price remains surprisingly reasonable, making it accessible to travelers seeking both luxury and affordability.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne enough. Whether you're visiting Paris for business or leisure, this hotel offers an experience that is nothing short of extraordinary. I am already looking forward to my next stay, and I am grateful to the hotel for providing me with such a memorable and delightful experience. Thank you for having me, Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne. Not sure how French rate their hotels but this hotel is FAR from 4 stars. I would give it 2 stars at most. I booked a year ago since I was planning to go to the Olympic. The hotel location is good and I read all the great reviews about this hotel so I decided to book it. The price was around 600 per night. For a 4 star hotel, I think this is an ok price. While I was booking the hotel, I specifically asked for higher floor and quiet room. I got email response from the hotel and saying they would try their best and its based on the availability. This is totally understandable. No communication after that. Mind that this was a year ago. When the day came and I finally arrived at the hotel, they gave me a tiny room on the second floor facing the street. I asked them to check my note and the staff said if you want higher floor facing the back, you should book the standard premium room. THIS WAS NEVER MENTIONED. I was under the impression that its based on availability. Had I was told I must booked a standard premium meaning even more expensive than 600 per night to get a higher floor and facing the back type of room, I would had booked that instead. The staff was extremely firm and kept saying impossible impossible to change room. I DID ASK TO CHANGE TO ANOTHER ROOM AND YOUR STAFF FIRMLY SAID IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HESITATION! You now replied saying you are fully booked for the Olympic which was what I booked it a year in advance for and paid the premium. I asked for a quiet room a year ago instead I got a ting room with bugs and facing the street!\\n\\nFine. I went to my room and was a completely shocked. For 600, it was extremely small. The room is a little small, but the location is very good, and the room is a little beautiful, but the quilt is a little itchy. The staff is very warm and polite, and they greet and smile warmly every day. Next time I go to Paris, I will choose to stay in this hotel again, but I hope the hygiene can be improved a little bit, and the quilt and sheets on the bed can be cleaner.\",\n          \"Nice location right next to the pier, but hard beds and no slippers provided. Also people checking in and out make a lot of noise in the morning and at night. The location is easy to be found and there is a Youbike station nearby so it's convenient to go around Tansui from this hostel.\\n\\nThere are free boardgames and black coffee at the ground floor so it's good to go with friends. There is also a lock room to keep your luggage after checking out.\\n\\nThe rooms are separated by genders but not the floors so I was a bit shocked to see males when I just finished showering. Great location, near MRT station and sight seeing places. Clean facilities and friendly English speaking staff. Good for short staying guests like cyclists. Foreigners like me need to understand that Taiwanese dont really consider breakfast as the most important meal of the day so better buy outside food to supplement the coffee, tea and toast they serve. This place is so nicee, i was live here for three months. The facility is great and the staf is very friendly.... I love it, if the staff read this review, I just want to say miss u guys, hope I can comeback again sometime Receptionist is really friendly! Location easily accessible and is 5mins walk away from nearest MRT. Great place to stay in for a couple of days!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"\\uc601\\uc5c5\\uc2dc\\uac04\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Monday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nTuesday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nWednesday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nThursday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nFriday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nSaturday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nSunday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\",\n          \"Monday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nTuesday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nSunday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\",\n          \"Monday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nTuesday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nSunday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"\\uce74\\ud14c\\uace0\\ub9ac\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"lodging, bar, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment\",\n          \"bar, spa, lodging, gym, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, health, establishment\",\n          \"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "\"This was the perfect accommodation for my first trip to Paris. The location suited all of my needs, and was very ideal and picturesque. The room has everything you need, even laundry and a full kitchen! The bed is comfy, and the large windows are beautiful. The only thing I would consider for some people is that there seems to be an elementary school with very vocal children all day long, which is disruptive if youre looking for quiet. Overall, I loved this apartment and will recommend it to everyone. Unforgettable stay.. Maison Le Bac made my Paris trip memorable. Location is wonderful lots of attractions nearby. Lots of bars nearby. Service was nice. We felt like home... My studio apartment was well managed. I had the most amazing stay at this flat in Paris! The location was perfect, close to all the major attractions and with easy access to public transportation. The flat itself was beautifully decorated and had all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The host was also extremely friendly and helpful, providing great recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a cozy and convenient place to stay in Paris. I can't wait to come back and stay here again! Nice place to stay. Large room with good bed and clean bathroom. This part of city is good and safe to stay. Super close to the center of Paris. Friendly and helpful staffs. Nice appartment hotel to stay. Excellent service will neat and clean bedroom. Good view and best location to stay as it is in the center of Paris. Easy excess to everything.\""

              "\"This was the perfect accommodation for my first trip to Paris. The location suited all of my needs, and was very ideal and picturesque. The room has everything you need, even laundry and a full kitchen! The bed is comfy, and the large windows are beautiful. The only thing I would consider for some people is that there seems to be an elementary school with very vocal children all day long, which is disruptive if youre looking for quiet. Overall, I loved this apartment and will recommend it to everyone. Unforgettable stay.. Maison Le Bac made my Paris trip memorable. Location is wonderful lots of attractions nearby. Lots of bars nearby. Service was nice. We felt like home... My studio apartment was well managed. I had the most amazing stay at this flat in Paris! The location was perfect, close to all the major attractions and with easy access to public transportation. The flat itself was beautifully decorated and had all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The host was also extremely friendly and helpful, providing great recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a cozy and convenient place to stay in Paris. I can't wait to come back and stay here again! Nice place to stay. Large room with good bed and clean bathroom. This part of city is good and safe to stay. Super close to the center of Paris. Friendly and helpful staffs. Nice appartment hotel to stay. Excellent service will neat and clean bedroom. Good view and best location to stay as it is in the center of Paris. Easy excess to everything. lodging, point_of_interest, establishment\""

All towels provided.\\nOur double bed was quite comfortable with clean linen and 2 pillows.\\nWe were 3 floors up and could not hear traffic noise from our window, No balcony.\\nIf you are visiting for 23 nights this would be perfectly adequate as a base, reasonably priced and good location for sightseeing. Very nice and helpful staff.  They were great about everything and very helpful.  Even tolerated by bad French attempts.  The location is excellent.  Near the Eiffel tower, dining, the metro.  And across the street from a laundromat if you need to do laundry for a longer stay.  The rooms are small, but that is to be expected for the location and price point.  If you are staying in Paris to see the sights and not the inside of your room, you will be fine.  Breakfast was perfect for the occasion. Rooms are of course on the small side, but that's typical of Paris. Bathroom is a bit dated, but has all of the necessary bits. It would be nice to have at least one more hook in the bathroom and to fit another shelf in somehow since there isn't much of a vanity, but these are small complaints.  Excellent location, wonderful staff. Would stay again. Great location, superbe service. Employees are super nice and useful.\\nBreakfast is reasonably priced and good.\\nMain issues we had\\n1. Noise inside the hotel, acceptable but could be better.\\n2. Rooms are really small.\\n3. Corridors and stairs are small, and always with cleaning materials.\\n\\nExcellent for a night or two. After that, it becomes super annoying. I recently had the pleasure of staying at a hotel conveniently located near the Eiffel Tower, and I must say it exceeded my expectations in many ways. The location alone is a significant highlightbeing just a short walk away from one of the world's most iconic landmarks made exploring Paris incredibly easy and enjoyable.\\n\\nThe staff at the hotel were exceptional. From the moment we checked in, they were welcoming, attentive, and always ready to assist with any requests or questions. Their warm hospitality truly enhanced our stay, making us feel right at home in the heart of Paris.\\n\\nOur room was another standout feature. It was impeccably clean and wellmaintained, providing a comfortable and relaxing environment after a day of sightseeing. The amenities were modern and thoughtful, ensuring we had everything we needed for a pleasant stay.\\n\\nIn addition to its proximity to the Eiffel Tower, the hotel is also conveniently located near several grocery stores and a variety of restaurants. This made it incredibly easy to grab a quick bite or stock up on essentials. Whether we were in the mood for a casual meal or a fine dining experience, we had plenty of excellent options just steps away.\\n\\nOverall, this hotel is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to stay close to the Eiffel Tower while enjoying topnotch service and clean, comfortable accommodations. The added convenience of nearby groceries and dining options makes it an even more attractive option for travelers. I highly recommend it and look forward to staying here again on my next visit to Paris.\",\n          \"Recently stayed at this hotel and felt compelled to leave a review. The staff was so kind, friendly, and helpful. We stayed in a superior room and while it was small, there was still room for all of our purchases. Daily Housekeeping also did a great job. Locationwise, this hotel was perfect for a first time visitor to Paris and was very accessible for flagging down a cab. Def recommend!! I traveled here with my mother and sister. My mother and I shared a junior suite and my sister used a deluxe single room. By American hotel chain standards the rooms may seem small but they met our needs for size, were charming and had many amenities.\\n\\nBeds were very comfortable. Bathroom amenities were excellent. Service was very friendly. We were very well cared for! Breakfast was included for our stay and the buffet was lovely.\\n\\nWe've enjoyed every minute! Nestled in the heart of Paris, Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne is a true gem that exceeds expectations. From the moment I stepped inside, I was enveloped in an atmosphere of beauty and charm. Despite its modest size, the hotel exudes elegance and sophistication, with every detail meticulously curated to perfection.\\n\\nThe impeccable service provided by the staff further elevated my experience. Their warmth and attentiveness made me feel truly valued as a guest, and their dedication to ensuring my comfort and satisfaction was unparalleled.\\n\\nLocationwise, Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne couldn't be better situated. Its prime position allowed me to easily explore the iconic landmarks and vibrant streets of Paris, making it the ideal base for my adventures in the city of lights.\\n\\nWhat truly sets this hotel apart is the exceptional value it offers. Despite its high quality and luxurious ambiance, the price remains surprisingly reasonable, making it accessible to travelers seeking both luxury and affordability.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne enough. Whether you're visiting Paris for business or leisure, this hotel offers an experience that is nothing short of extraordinary. I am already looking forward to my next stay, and I am grateful to the hotel for providing me with such a memorable and delightful experience. Thank you for having me, Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne. Not sure how French rate their hotels but this hotel is FAR from 4 stars. I would give it 2 stars at most. I booked a year ago since I was planning to go to the Olympic. The hotel location is good and I read all the great reviews about this hotel so I decided to book it. The price was around 600 per night. For a 4 star hotel, I think this is an ok price. While I was booking the hotel, I specifically asked for higher floor and quiet room. I got email response from the hotel and saying they would try their best and its based on the availability. This is totally understandable. No communication after that. Mind that this was a year ago. When the day came and I finally arrived at the hotel, they gave me a tiny room on the second floor facing the street. I asked them to check my note and the staff said if you want higher floor facing the back, you should book the standard premium room. THIS WAS NEVER MENTIONED. I was under the impression that its based on availability. Had I was told I must booked a standard premium meaning even more expensive than 600 per night to get a higher floor and facing the back type of room, I would had booked that instead. The staff was extremely firm and kept saying impossible impossible to change room. I DID ASK TO CHANGE TO ANOTHER ROOM AND YOUR STAFF FIRMLY SAID IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HESITATION! You now replied saying you are fully booked for the Olympic which was what I booked it a year in advance for and paid the premium. I asked for a quiet room a year ago instead I got a ting room with bugs and facing the street!\\n\\nFine. I went to my room and was a completely shocked. For 600, it was extremely small. The room is a little small, but the location is very good, and the room is a little beautiful, but the quilt is a little itchy. The staff is very warm and polite, and they greet and smile warmly every day. Next time I go to Paris, I will choose to stay in this hotel again, but I hope the hygiene can be improved a little bit, and the quilt and sheets on the bed can be cleaner.\",\n          \"Nice location right next to the pier, but hard beds and no slippers provided. Also people checking in and out make a lot of noise in the morning and at night. The location is easy to be found and there is a Youbike station nearby so it's convenient to go around Tansui from this hostel.\\n\\nThere are free boardgames and black coffee at the ground floor so it's good to go with friends. There is also a lock room to keep your luggage after checking out.\\n\\nThe rooms are separated by genders but not the floors so I was a bit shocked to see males when I just finished showering. Great location, near MRT station and sight seeing places. Clean facilities and friendly English speaking staff. Good for short staying guests like cyclists. Foreigners like me need to understand that Taiwanese dont really consider breakfast as the most important meal of the day so better buy outside food to supplement the coffee, tea and toast they serve. This place is so nicee, i was live here for three months. The facility is great and the staf is very friendly.... I love it, if the staff read this review, I just want to say miss u guys, hope I can comeback again sometime Receptionist is really friendly! Location easily accessible and is 5mins walk away from nearest MRT. Great place to stay in for a couple of days!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"\\uc601\\uc5c5\\uc2dc\\uac04\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Monday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nTuesday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nWednesday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nThursday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nFriday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nSaturday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\\nSunday: 7:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20091:00\\u202fAM\",\n          \"Monday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nTuesday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\\nSunday: 11:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20099:00\\u202fPM\",\n          \"Monday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nTuesday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\\nSunday: 9:00\\u202fAM\\u2009\\u2013\\u20096:00\\u202fPM\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"\\uce74\\ud14c\\uace0\\ub9ac\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"lodging, bar, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment\",\n          \"bar, spa, lodging, gym, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, health, establishment\",\n          \"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"\\uc885\\ud569\\uc815\\ubcf4\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 189,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{'\\uc774\\ub984': 'La maison du bonheur - best bnb for 6 in Paris', '\\uc8fc\\uc18c': 'Rue de Lancry, 75010 Paris, France', '\\ud3c9\\uc810': '5', '\\ub9ac\\ubdf0': 'A great Airbnb, Katerina is very pleasant!', '\\uc601\\uc5c5\\uc2dc\\uac04': 'no operation time', '\\uce74\\ud14c\\uace0\\ub9ac': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment'}\",\n          \"{'\\uc774\\ub984': 'Auberge de jeunesse Fourcy - MIJE Marais', '\\uc8fc\\uc18c': '6 Rue de Fourcy, 75004 Paris, France', '\\ud3c9\\uc810': '4.1', '\\ub9ac\\ubdf0': \\\"I stayed here for a few nights and loved it. It's in a beautiful old building in a great spot in the Marais. I found the place super clean, it had a good vibe and friendly staff. There are no lockers in the room which would be the only suggested improvement, but they have lockers for your valuables in the luggage storage room near reception. The room I stayed in had power outlets near the beds. The USB charger didn't work, but the normal outlet did, so no issues there. Would stay again! Location is perfect, great restaurants nearby, very local and walking distance to many sights\\\\n\\\\nThe room was good, clean. Had a shower inside.\\\\n\\\\nThe points to improve\\\\n1 Breakfast was horrible. I understand that breakfast isnt very present in the french culture, so I was okay with just bread and jam. But what I was not okay was with the food being covered in flies, nothing to stop them from lying on top of the cake and bread. There were also no plates. That was really disgusting. I didnt even attend breakfast for the remaining of my stay.\\\\n2The staff werent very keen on helping Don't stay here. I booked this in a pinch because of high reviews and everything sucked. Weird mix of high school students, and people with babies. None of the plugs next to the beds worked, breakfast was an excuse for them to charge more and you get rock solid baguette and water coffee. Also a woman controlling the orange juice and coffee so you don't take too much. NO LOCKERS TO LOCK YOUR THINGS IN THE BEDROOM. And ants in the main foyer where you eat breakfast. Would not recommend. Poor room, Poor shower, Poor staff\\\\nIt was like a bunker not a room.\\\\nA BED was just located in front of the alley that everybody can see with NO DOOR.\\\\nNot even a SINGLE WINDOW cannot be opened in this room, which makes the air so bad and way too hot.\\\\n\\\\nNot even has a storage for luggage.\\\\nWIFI NOT WORKING IN YOUR ROOM.\\\\n\\\\nA girl at checkin center were rude, didnt give any information.\\\\n\\\\nEach room needs to climb a narrow stairs.\\\\n\\\\nIm sorry but nothing else was satisfied except the location.

We had decent sleep for the first couple nights while they had AC operating. Unfortunately during the last night of my stay when they switched from AC to heat, we couldnt sleep at all the entire night because the room was too hot and we couldnt fall asleep with the window opened because of the loud noise from pedestrians outside. Their blanket is super thick, making the situation even worse. Their rooms dont have individual heatAC control as its all central for the entire hotel. My stay couldve been perfect if their rooms had standalone heatAC control and a better hair dryer. My friends and I stayed here for 5 nights at the end of April. We primarily chose this hotel for two reasons, being situated in quaint street off Le Marais and the connecting rooms they offered. Unlike in the USA, where rooms are adjoined by an interior door, their connecting rooms didn't have an interior door but an additional exterior door that opened up to two separate rooms. Initially, we were confused but all worked out at the end. It just gave more privacy to each rooms than what was expected from American standard to be clear.\\\\n\\\\nStaffs were super helpful and friendly. Rooms were small yet kept very clean and decorated nicely. Beds were comfortable. We used their dry sauna and steam rooms a couple of nights and it was lovely. We were able to make reservation for private use of the spa which was a bonus. They offered complimentary espresso and bubbly soda through out the day and we absolutely indulged on that. The breakfast cafe is in the ground level and offered a great spread of continental as well as hot breakfast items like scrambled eggs and sausages.\\\\n\\\\nMy room came with a divider bathroom area and a tub for the shower. I had a drainage issue with the tub but a maintenance was called upon as soon as I notified it and fixed the issue on the spot. Overall a solid hotel. The rooms were a bit dated and not as nice as what I would expect for paying a little more than 200  night but other aspects of the hotel were good.\\\\n\\\\nIt is located close to oberkampf and republique metro which are on the main subway line. Additionally it is close to Utopia Bakery which is a fantastic bakery and is close to a few notable cool streets like rue de temple.\\\\n\\\\nThe staff are also very friendly and helpful. They helped us regain access to our hotel room and also conveniently provided umbrellas for us when we needed them. There is also staff manning the door at night so they keep an eye on things going on around the hotel. Loved my 4 night stay at the hotel. Staffs are all so friendly, hotel let me store my luggage there 1 day before my stay begins. My top floor room were extremely quiet. Hotel itself was comfortable, modern, with all the amenities 247 coffee machines and watersparkling water dispenser. Also very conveniently located between 2 stations that are 5mins walk away. We were only supposed to stay here for one week for a work trip but ended up extending for 3 weeks. The NICEST STAFF. they let us keep our luggage in a room for 3 days because we had to step out for a couple days. they also were extremely helpful when we needed extra towels or other little things for the room.  Usually, hotel staff are a bit stiff and uppity ... but the hotel staff here felt very friendly  human  just so so so easy to talk to.\\\\n\\\\nHIGHLY HIGHLY would recommend staying here over any other hotels. worth every .\\\", '\\uc601\\uc5c5\\uc2dc\\uac04': 'no operation time', '\\uce74\\ud14c\\uace0\\ub9ac': 'city_hall, lodging, local_government_office, spa, point_of_interest, establishment'}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Great location, great service, but the rooms are a tad small. Our room window faced a central patio and you could hear the neighbours or smell people smoking through the windows. Other than that, we really liked the hotel. Small rooms, but that is normal in this area of Paris. This is not a criticism, just trying to inform people that this is the situation in many hotels in this city. Breakfast was quite decent, and I especially loved how well situated it was and the fact that they allowed you to have free snacks and drinks from the minibar. We really liked this hotel. It was located closed to a metro station, making it easier to navigate around Paris. This hotel is part of a group of hotels spread around Paris and your key works in the other hotels. For instance, when we wanted to cool off and take a break we would go to a sister hotel and relax  We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights during the Olympic Games. We booked more than 6 months in advanced and they completely robed us. We payed 400night on a double room for 3 rooms and the experience was very bad. The hotel rooms have nothing to do with the pictures in their website, they are super small and antique with 0 taste. The shower was tiny and hot water stopped after 30 seconds. They only provide 1 soap for everything. Our room was up from the breakfast room and in the morning it smelled a lot like food. Elevator is terribly slow and we left very disappointed we spent so much money for the quality received.

We had a deluxe room, which was roomy by European standards. The hotel and rooms are beautiful, very tastefully decorated, and very clean. Beds and pillows are super comfortable. We appreciate being able to control the ac, as that is most often not the case in many European hotels. Some reviewers noted that the rooms were noisy, but we found them to be very quiet, especially since the windows are triple paned, which really helps to cut down on street noise. Breakfast was amazing, and Anna who works in the breakfast room is so sweet. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because Patricia, the manager was unwilling to help us with our simple request. We had booked and paid for a room that included a full breakfast each day which was not cheap. We ended up having to change our flight going home and had to leave that morning at 6am, well before breakfast started. Even when we gave ample notice and asked politely if we could be reimbursed for the expensive breakfast we wouldn't be there to eat, Patricia refused to do so. We thought she would be more accommodating, especially since we were repeat guests, but that unfortunately she wasn't willing to budge. Delightful hotel in a fabulous location. Easy walking or public transport to all the Paris landmarks.  Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Room was snug, bathroom a good size. Only suggestion would be that the hairdryers need updating. We will definitely be recommending Hotel Academia to friends. Beautiful little boutique hotel in Saint Germain with convenient access to metro, restaurants, shops, and walking distance to many famous sites. While the rooms may be small, that is not unusual for Paris. The staff is warm and welcoming and the breakfast fresh and delicious. We were extremely pleased with our stay at Academie SaintGermain Hotel in Paris,  France. The Front Desk Staff were very courteous, friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  We helped us immensely to get around Paris. Anna, the Lady who made our breakfasts each morning, was so friendly and did an amazing job, making sure the food was perfect and set up beautifully.  She was so happy and friendly!  Thank you to all, who made our stay so unforgettable!!! Diane and Jeff Brooks, Canada Its part of my fault that I overlooked the tiny size of their classic room 139 spft, 13 m2 when I booked the hotel. However, this is supposed to be a 4star hotel. I never expect such a hotel to have this miserably tiny room size. I had to move the bed around in order to find space to place my luggage. There are other hotels in Paris zone 1 that cost the same in other good neighborhoods with bigger rooms and better amenities. Its surprising to me that this 4star hotel doesnt come with a real hair dryer. Luckily I was able to borrow one from the front desk. Otherwise, it wouldve cost me at least one hour to dry my hair with their default hair dryer located in the tiny bathroom right next to the toilet.\", '7_영업시간': 'Monday: Open 24 hours\\nTuesday: Open 24 hours\\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\\nThursday: Open 24 hours\\nFriday: Open 24 hours\\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\\nSunday: Open 24 hours', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

Over the past few years, there has been a surge of alternative lodging options, and JoeJoe stands out for its unique blend of a hostel vibe with a concertlike atmosphere. If youre looking for luxury, this might not be the place for you, but if youre seeking an adventurous, creative, and downtoearth experience, JoeJoe delivers exactly that.\\n\\nThe rooms are minimalist, almost evoking the feel of being backstage at a music venue. While the dcor is pared down to the essentials, everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided. The beds, though covered in a fake leather or plastic material that can get humid at times, are surprisingly soft and comfortable. I slept soundly for three nights. The one downside might be that the rooms are a bit dark, but that seems to match the aesthetic of the place.\\n\\nWhere JoeJoe truly shines is in its service and atmosphere. The staff is exceptionally friendly and welcoming, going out of their way to ensure guests feel at home. Upon departure, we even received hugs, which speaks volumes about the personal touch they provide. Though we didnt have breakfast there, the coffee was excellent, and we opted to explore the citys brunch scene instead.\\n\\nThe bathroom and shower facilities are modern and spotless, adding a touch of luxury to an otherwise strippedback room setup. Despite the simplistic accommodations, the lively and warm environment, combined with the excellent service, made our stay memorable. We will definitely recommend JoeJoe to others and will likely return ourselves. pros\\n the service was fantastic\\n lovely location\\n great bathrooms\\n fantastic rooftop patio.\\n\\ncons\\n everyone was french. its a hostel, it should be diverse and not full of french people. we were one of, if not the only nonfrench people there. I dont understand why French people are staying in hostels in their own country.\\n the shower did leak and got some of my clothes wet, but it was not the end of the world.\\n one of the people that shared a room with us got my girlfriend and i sick. not only did he get us sick, but he kept the whole room up every night. he ruined the rest of our europe trip. its extremely selfish of him to put others in harm. if you are sick, do not stay in a mixed dorm you moron.\\n It was warm but that was out of the hostels control.\\n it wouldve been nice to know about events or pub crawls in the city. Immaculate hostel. Staff are so friendly. Check in process was quick and efficient. I love the LED lights around the hallways and the bathrooms are gorgeous and very clean. Would definitely go again. 5 stars!  I loved my stay there. Super close to the metro and well connected to the main attractions. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again. I loved the location, which was close to a metro station, a grocery store, a bakery, a library, and several restaurants. 4 euro for a towel is not bad in my opinion, especially if you don't have much room in your suitcase  Bathroom was pretty clean throughout the day. I hated that the AC in the room didnt work well. The room was warm. I woke up sweating several times.

A delightful hotel offering comfortable rooms and good breakfasts. The staff are all very helpful. Rooms are small as in many Parisian hotels. Pillows are not featherdown and not very comfortable though bed is good.  Good value. If you are looking for a boutique Parisian hotel with exceptional service in a central location, look no further!\\n\\nMy family of four spent four lovely nights at La Maison Favart on our first visit to Paris.\\n\\nThe hotel is charming and central to all things  20 minute walk to the Louvre.\\n\\nWe had two rooms facing the opera and it was so lovely to be able to open the windows. The rooms were pretty small, as expected in Paris, so we opted for two.\\n\\nFor our first visit we wanted a hotel that could help us navigate the city, restaurants and tours. The staff at La Maison Favart were exceptional, especially Boris and Freddie! Boris went out of his way to find a fun pub for us to watch the Euros  to be in Paris as the French team won was just fantastic!\\n\\nGreat stay all around. Thank you La Maison Favart! My husband and I throughly enjoyed our stay here.\\n\\nIt was a very last minute honeymoon trip so we didnt have much time to prepare. For this reason, we had to make several requests to the hotel. Thankfully, they were incredibly kind and accommodating and made sure that we were comfortable throughout our stay.\\n\\nI was very impressed with the service and attention to detail  they clearly do their best to get to know and accommodate all of their guests.\\n\\nThe bedroom was clean and well resourced, the view was absolutely incredible we were able to take some amazing pictures!. The bathroom was beautiful and had an incredible shower.\\n\\nOn top of this, the location was absolutely perfect. Everything we needed was within walking distance. The area felt incredibly safe and we could walk around at night with ease.\\n\\nOur experience was a 1010. If youre thinking of booking here please do! If I could give this hotel negative stars, I would.  Appalling, Executive summary  stay elsewhere.\\n\\nI stayed here as our small group tour had selected this hotel.  Based on reviews I stayed independent of the group two extra nights prior to the tour.\\n\\nFirstly, a general commentary.  The rooms are smallish not the worst you\\'ll find in Paris though! and the showers are great!  A decent flow of hot water was fabulous.\\n\\nThe towels are out of this world!  The best towels I\\'ve every experienced.  Thick and soft, I\\'d love to buy some!\\n\\nIt\\'s an old hotel and the single lift is slow.  Best to take the stairs if you\\'re body is able.\\n\\nBreakfast is a small offering and I was disappointed to learn it had been highlighted with our group manager that we had arrived early for breakfast and the staff were not happy.  The problem with this is twofold  it wasn\\'t anyone on our group that did this.  And in fact, on this day, I arrived about 15 minutes after breakfast was supposed to have started to very little food having been put out.  Still by the time I left not all food had been supplied and there were ice bricks waiting in their place.  This was about 45 mins after breakfast was supposed to have started.\\n\\nThe central heating is also problematic.  Rooms do not have individual temperature controls so I find it gets quite hot.  I\\'d happily open the window but due to noise see below that\\'s not an option.  In addition to the massive issues detailed below even on a \\'good\\' night you have people calling out throughout the square etc there are a couple of homeless people that seem to use it too which kept others awake until they closed their windows.\\n\\nNow the major issue.  Noise.\\n\\nThere is a public square across the road.  On my first evening at the hotel I checked in and was told absolutely nothing about this  however, there was a commercialmovie being filmed in this square and it started in the early evening and did not finish until 5am.  Having had no sleep I was grateful that it had finally ended.  But no, the noise continued with trucks reversing and beeping as they dismantled the set for several more hours.\\n\\nNow upon my return visit it is a wedding reception.  Guests started arriving around 7pm and at 345am I am writing this review, once again with no sleep and once again with an abundance of noise coming from this square.  People are drinking and loudly chatting on the street immediately in front of the hotel, not inside the marquee though the piano is still getting a workout, possibly by guests, as a poor level of music is being performed eg Chopsticks.\\n\\nThis is an expensive hotel and for this price point there are many superior hotels to stay in.  Choose another one.\\n\\nWhat is most disappointing is that on both occasions the hotel did not inform me.  They could have offered ear plugs, a reduced rate, a free drink etc.  Nothing.  Why on earth anyone would pay full price to have no sleep I do not know.  Who wants to walk around Paris like a zombie?\\n\\nFor it to have happened twice it must be a regular occurrence.  I did mention it to hotel staff when I saw the marquee being set up yesterday to which I was told it wouldn\\'t bother me as there are many neighbours and people using the square are not allowed to make noise.  When I mentioned that it had kept me away only two weeks ago he replied, \"I\\'ll inform my colleague.\"\\n\\nAs you may imagine, that was the last I heard of it and I\\'m having my second sleepless night in Fauvart.\\n\\nTruly, stay elsewhere.  Paris is full of marvellous options, this isn\\'t one of them.\\n\\nPhoto taken at 330am. Finally finished at 345am. Its now 605am and theyve been dismantling for the past 2 hours and 20 mins, banging and crashing and yelling the whole time. Helpful and friendly staff. Rooms are nice and clean. Updated bathrooms are welcome. Mid afternoon cake and snacks are great addition. Location is perfect  can walk to restaurants, train, groceries in a few minutes. The area felt safe. Again shout out to the staff members who are really helpful.', '7_영업시간': 'no operation time', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

They were able to have our room ready early which was a nice surprise. We arranged flowers, champagne, and chocolates in our room at welcome for our anniversary and the they displayed them in our room beautifully.

It has very good RER and Metro access to numerous lines within a 3 min walk.  A TON of great places to eat close by.\\n\\nThird  clean, no bugs.\\n\\nFourth  had an elevator.  Worlds smallest, but it worked think 3 large suitcases wide by 1 deep.  Claustrophobic people will not be able to use it.\\n\\nFifth  people were friendly, polite and very professional.  Was safe and secure. From arrival to departure the hotel visit was excellent. We were greeted and checked in as soon as we arrived and were taken to our room so we could freshen up before heading out for food well before checkin time. The room was very comfortable with a place for everything, very comfortable bed, closet and fantastic water pressure. The location could not be better for walking and dining. Easy access to the Metro and RER. Highly recommended for friendly staff and location. Well return. We loved this hotel! It is close to everything, very comfortable and clean, and there are several restaurants around. The team, particularly Willy, was always so helpful and friendly! We would recommend this hotel to anyone, and we would stay again when visiting Paris.', '7_영업시간': 'Monday: Open 24 hours\\nTuesday: Open 24 hours\\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\\nThursday: Open 24 hours\\nFriday: Open 24 hours\\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\\nSunday: Open 24 hours', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

Nestled in the vibrant Marais district, I was surrounded by chic boutiques, cozy cafs, and historic sites. It was easy to explore the city on foot, and public transportation was just a short walk away.\\nThe room itself was quite tiny, which is typical for Parisian accommodations. Despite the size, it had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.\\nWhat truly made my stay memorable was the staff. They were incredibly helpful and friendly, always ready to offer recommendations and assistance. Their warm hospitality added a personal touch to my visit.\\n\\nIn summary, if you're looking for a central location and friendly service in Paris, this hotel is a great choice. Just be prepared for a snug room, and youll be all set for a fantastic stay! I'm not sure how this hotel has such high ratings. I would imagine that if you visit this hotel during colder months it would be okay.\\n\\nI felt that I was profiled by the receptionist, being a solo male traveller. Before assigning my room, the receptionist consulted with housekeeping staff. I believe I was given the worst room in the hotel based on being a solo male traveller, room 17. As you can see from the photos, the inside room temperature was almost 30 degrees Celsius at around noon. I wanted to open my window, as the outside temperature was very pleasant. However, as you can see from the photos, my view was of the exhaust fan of the hotel's kitchen.\\n\\nThe provided fans did help somewhat. But again, from my photos, you can see that the fans were both caked in dust and blowing out dust bunnies. If you have dust allergies, you should avoid this place like the plague. The fans created a dust vortex in the room to the point where I felt I was coughing up a lung and my eyes were swollen.\\n\\nAfter the first night, I booked at the Courtyard and forfeited the remaining 2 nights at this property, as I booked on Expedia, and the hotel had a no refund policy. Thankfully, I had some points to redeem. I'm convinced that the positive reviews here are fake reviews. The emails from Marie Courier also seem fake and must be the alias of the gentleman working at reception. Stayed 4 nights and the location was perfect! Great restaurants near by and super walkable to get around Paris! Staff was super friendly! And bonus that for our fam of 4 2 teens, 2 adults our room had 2 twin beds so kids didn't have to share!  Would definitely stay here again. My friend and i had this hotel reccomended, we were extremly disappointed. it is nothing like as shown on the website.\\nthe room was very small the ensuite too small even for one person.we stayed only one night at a greater expense we found another Hotel around the corner which was four start and not a lot of difference in the price.the only positive thing i can say is the room and ensuite were clean, other wise the whole hotel needs a refurbishment. The breakfast room is nothing like it is shown on the website.i agree with other reviews i cannot understand how it gets high reviews. This hotel was unacceptable. The price gauging for the olympics may have lead me to book a lesser hotel than i would have got in this price range ordinarily and perhaps i should have spent more for a better hotel but the rooms are tiny and run down. All members of staff are rude or inconsiderate barring one lovely young man who checked me in and was there on occasion on front desk. There is no AC, there is no curtain or blinds for the bathroom window, the room has to be under 100 square foot its genuinely that small, the shower is either unbearably hot or too cold and when you finally get it right youll get a random blast of hot water come through without touching anything, all of the walls are paper thin i had little to no sleep thanks to screaming babies and hearing everything on the hotel floor, the stairs are not safe to walk down they are so wonky, i asked in the survey they sent me before arrival that my room would not be cleaned for the duration of the stay and this was ignored by the cleaners every single day, who would try and force entry even if i was asleep or in the shower, theyd wake me up and only take no for an answer after insisting repeatedly which was creepy, even when i was not present at all they moved all of my belongings around the room. They confiscate your hotel key whenever you leave, but lock the door at night so if you return from a club or bar you have to stand outside and knock, eventually they come and act surprised and annoyed that you dare come back so late, as if theyre your parents or something. I was told a different check out time but then they enforced the normal checkout time so after having a very late night thinking i had more time to check out the next day, i was awoken by a rude obnoxious man who said you must leave in the next 10 minutes then suddenly didnt understand english when i responded, saying WHAT?! as if to mock the fact im english, i dont understand your accent. WHAATTTTTT?!!! before stressing me minutes later you have to leave immediately get down here and then telling me off and laughing in the lobby infront of guests when i checked out. Because of this if it wasnt for a friends hotels kindness i would have had to walk around paris with my bags for hours before my flight. How theyre reviewed so highly i have no idea. I guess it was clean and i didnt have any of my stuff go missing.\", '7_영업시간': 'Monday: Open 24 hours\\nTuesday: Open 24 hours\\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\\nThursday: Open 24 hours\\nFriday: Open 24 hours\\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\\nSunday: Open 24 hours', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

Absolutely spectacular service from April  one of Concierge  from all of the Concierge staff and the entire staff at the hotel. The sweet upgrade was spectacular, the room perfectly and unruly maintained. We had some issues with luggage that didnt even concern the hotel, but they went above and beyond to assist. As a traveler, and a travel professional? I would 100 recommend them. The location is handy but not much to do onsite.

The spa is totally shutdown. The lights in the room are computer controlled and seem to turn on and off at random times, both day and night.  The room smells of sewer drain each time we shower. The shower water also comes out and leaves water on the floor.  No wash cloths in the bathroom . We cant open curtain because people from offices across street stare right into the room. Rooms are very small. There is only one luggage holder rack for one suitcase and we are two  really nowhere to put anything. The staff members are all wonderful and very understanding, but they have a hard job. This is the first Luxury Collection hotel at which we have stayed, but so far the luxury part seems to be completely missing.  The staff and breakfast buffet are outstanding, but we find hotel staff always wonderful at all Marriott hotels we stay at. It is hard to justify and to understand what makes this hotel luxury and the cost it has given all these problems. What a lovely property! The hotel and rooms are beautiful. The service is better!

So glad to have stumble upon it. Perfect location and impeccably clean. Rooms are small but the layout maximize space and you dont feel like you need more. Staff were so friendly and decorations were classy. Highly highly recommend Never explored Paris so effortlessly. When we say a hotel that makes you definitely visit next time is must be services good, sleep well and energy in daytime. Suit for city explorer and even you can explore quite a bit in the hotel. Tea in lobby really nice for a exclusive appointment with friends in Le Maris but not overwhelming by the crowds. Everything was great. The rooms were comfortable and clean though a little small but its a boutique so that was expected. The bathrooms have nice huge tubs which was a plus after walking all day. The common areas were so cool and inviting, and the staff was helpful without being over the top about it. We chose not to take the breakfast. There are many spots outside with lots of options. The place is one of the most lovely hotel Ive ever been to. Its what I call luxury quiet meaning that its beautiful and luxurious without doing too much. I loved the junior suite with the beautiful bathtub, the wood around the bed. The little outdoor terrasse downstairs.\\nExtra 5 starts for the service and the staff members who were just adorable.\\nAll of this in the heart of Paris in le Marais. Will definitely come back ! It was the perfect place to explore and relax  a very intimate and discreet hotel in the heart of marais. With cozy bathtubs and vinyls.

Great location next to Jardin du Luxembourg DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!\\nTried to charge us more up front until we showed him the price we  booked. He still wanted more money but we refused!\\nWORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! Bed broke when sat on it. Rooms are tiny, if you are travelling with kids they will give you cots that  collapse with wood bottom and no blankets.had to demand mattress and was told blankets only for adults  had to take blankets off another room with no help. When the concierge didnt know how to put up cots he  left us to figure it out, then was told not his problem. Breakfast room is in the reception lobby. Breakfast is expensive and not worth it. No fridge in rooms shower is tiny and bathroom can fit only 1 person at a time  The floors in the rooms are also  uneven and on tilted slants. We had 3 rooms and they were all the same.

We had a room located towards the theater and enjoyed our sleep and view. The staff was friendly and let me leave something in their fridge overnight. There is always someone at the desk, even at one am. The hotel feels safe, and there is a small elevator. Some things to note are the rooms have one USB and one usbc charging port, there is no microwave or fridge in the room. I felt the superior room was spacious enough for two, but of course much smaller than I am used to. The shower room is small too, even for the superior room. We recently stayed at Hotel Michelet Odon, and its location is absolutely fantastic for walking and exploring Paris. The rooms and bathrooms were modern and clean, which made for a comfortable stay. Though the rooms were quite small, it was a reasonable tradeoff given the prime location. The only downside was that the wifi in the room wasn't great. I would definitely stay here again when I return to Paris in the future. very bad rooms and bad attitude at the reception. they force you to leave the key whenever you are leaving the room for security purposes. at 7 in the morning the housekeeper started to make a lot of noise so we could not rest as we wished. the price of the room can ONLY be justified by the location, but nothing more.\", '7_영업시간': 'Monday: Open 24 hours\\nTuesday: Open 24 hours\\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\\nThursday: Open 24 hours\\nFriday: Open 24 hours\\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\\nSunday: Open 24 hours', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

This is not a criticism, just trying to inform people that this is the situation in many hotels in this city. Breakfast was quite decent, and I especially loved how well situated it was and the fact that they allowed you to have free snacks and drinks from the minibar. We really liked this hotel. It was located closed to a metro station, making it easier to navigate around Paris. This hotel is part of a group of hotels spread around Paris and your key works in the other hotels. For instance, when we wanted to cool off and take a break we would go to a sister hotel and relax  We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights during the Olympic Games. We booked more than 6 months in advanced and they completely robed us. We payed 400night on a double room for 3 rooms and the experience was very bad. The hotel rooms have nothing to do with the pictures in their website, they are super small and antique with 0 taste. The shower was tiny and hot water stopped after 30 seconds. They only provide 1 soap for everything. Our room was up from the breakfast room and in the morning it smelled a lot like food.

We appreciate being able to control the ac, as that is most often not the case in many European hotels. Some reviewers noted that the rooms were noisy, but we found them to be very quiet, especially since the windows are triple paned, which really helps to cut down on street noise. Breakfast was amazing, and Anna who works in the breakfast room is so sweet. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because Patricia, the manager was unwilling to help us with our simple request. We had booked and paid for a room that included a full breakfast each day which was not cheap. We ended up having to change our flight going home and had to leave that morning at 6am, well before breakfast started. Even when we gave ample notice and asked politely if we could be reimbursed for the expensive breakfast we wouldn't be there to eat, Patricia refused to do so. We thought she would be more accommodating, especially since we were repeat guests, but that unfortunately she wasn't willing to budge. Delightful hotel in a fabulous location. Easy walking or public transport to all the Paris landmarks.  Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Room was snug, bathroom a good size. Only suggestion would be that the hairdryers need updating. We will definitely be recommending Hotel Academia to friends. Beautiful little boutique hotel in Saint Germain with convenient access to metro, restaurants, shops, and walking distance to many famous sites. While the rooms may be small, that is not unusual for Paris. The staff is warm and welcoming and the breakfast fresh and delicious. We were extremely pleased with our stay at Academie SaintGermain Hotel in Paris,  France. The Front Desk Staff were very courteous, friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.

She was so happy and friendly!  Thank you to all, who made our stay so unforgettable!!! Diane and Jeff Brooks, Canada Its part of my fault that I overlooked the tiny size of their classic room 139 spft, 13 m2 when I booked the hotel. However, this is supposed to be a 4star hotel. I never expect such a hotel to have this miserably tiny room size. I had to move the bed around in order to find space to place my luggage. There are other hotels in Paris zone 1 that cost the same in other good neighborhoods with bigger rooms and better amenities. Its surprising to me that this 4star hotel doesnt come with a real hair dryer. Luckily I was able to borrow one from the front desk. Otherwise, it wouldve cost me at least one hour to dry my hair with their default hair dryer located in the tiny bathroom right next to the toilet.\", '7_영업시간': 'Monday: Open 24 hours\\nTuesday: Open 24 hours\\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\\nThursday: Open 24 hours\\nFriday: Open 24 hours\\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\\nSunday: Open 24 hours', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

If youre looking for luxury, this might not be the place for you, but if youre seeking an adventurous, creative, and downtoearth experience, JoeJoe delivers exactly that.\\n\\nThe rooms are minimalist, almost evoking the feel of being backstage at a music venue. While the dcor is pared down to the essentials, everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided. The beds, though covered in a fake leather or plastic material that can get humid at times, are surprisingly soft and comfortable. I slept soundly for three nights. The one downside might be that the rooms are a bit dark, but that seems to match the aesthetic of the place.\\n\\nWhere JoeJoe truly shines is in its service and atmosphere. The staff is exceptionally friendly and welcoming, going out of their way to ensure guests feel at home. Upon departure, we even received hugs, which speaks volumes about the personal touch they provide. Though we didnt have breakfast there, the coffee was excellent, and we opted to explore the citys brunch scene instead.\\n\\nThe bathroom and shower facilities are modern and spotless, adding a touch of luxury to an otherwise strippedback room setup. Despite the simplistic accommodations, the lively and warm environment, combined with the excellent service, made our stay memorable. We will definitely recommend JoeJoe to others and will likely return ourselves. pros\\n the service was fantastic\\n lovely location\\n great bathrooms\\n fantastic rooftop patio.\\n\\ncons\\n everyone was french. its a hostel, it should be diverse and not full of french people. we were one of, if not the only nonfrench people there.

Would definitely stay there again. I loved the location, which was close to a metro station, a grocery store, a bakery, a library, and several restaurants. 4 euro for a towel is not bad in my opinion, especially if you don't have much room in your suitcase  Bathroom was pretty clean throughout the day.

The rooms were pretty small, as expected in Paris, so we opted for two.\\n\\nFor our first visit we wanted a hotel that could help us navigate the city, restaurants and tours.

My husband and I throughly enjoyed our stay here.\\n\\nIt was a very last minute honeymoon trip so we didnt have much time to prepare. For this reason, we had to make several requests to the hotel. Thankfully, they were incredibly kind and accommodating and made sure that we were comfortable throughout our stay.\\n\\nI was very impressed with the service and attention to detail  they clearly do their best to get to know and accommodate all of their guests.\\n\\nThe bedroom was clean and well resourced, the view was absolutely incredible we were able to take some amazing pictures!.

If I could give this hotel negative stars, I would.  Appalling, Executive summary  stay elsewhere.\\n\\nI stayed here as our small group tour had selected this hotel.

The problem with this is twofold  it wasn\\'t anyone on our group that did this.  And in fact, on this day, I arrived about 15 minutes after breakfast was supposed to have started to very little food having been put out.  Still by the time I left not all food had been supplied and there were ice bricks waiting in their place.  This was about 45 mins after breakfast was supposed to have started.\\n\\nThe central heating is also problematic.  Rooms do not have individual temperature controls so I find it gets quite hot.  I\\'d happily open the window but due to noise see below that\\'s not an option.  In addition to the massive issues detailed below even on a \\'good\\' night you have people calling out throughout the square etc there are a couple of homeless people that seem to use it too which kept others awake until they closed their windows.\\n\\nNow the major issue.  Noise.\\n\\nThere is a public square across the road.  On my first evening at the hotel I checked in and was told absolutely nothing about this  however, there was a commercialmovie being filmed in this square and it started in the early evening and did not finish until 5am.  Having had no sleep I was grateful that it had finally ended.  But no, the noise continued with trucks reversing and beeping as they dismantled the set for several more hours.\\n\\nNow upon my return visit it is a wedding reception.  Guests started arriving around 7pm and at 345am I am writing this review, once again with no sleep and once again with an abundance of noise coming from this square.  People are drinking and loudly chatting on the street immediately in front of the hotel, not inside the marquee though the piano is still getting a workout, possibly by guests, as a poor level of music is being performed eg Chopsticks.\\n\\nThis is an expensive hotel and for this price point there are many superior hotels to stay in.  Choose another one.\\n\\nWhat is most disappointing is that on both occasions the hotel did not inform me.  They could have offered ear plugs, a reduced rate, a free drink etc.  Nothing.  Why on earth anyone would pay full price to have no sleep I do not know.  Who wants to walk around Paris like a zombie?\\n\\nFor it to have happened twice it must be a regular occurrence.  I did mention it to hotel staff when I saw the marquee being set up yesterday to which I was told it wouldn\\'t bother me as there are many neighbours and people using the square are not allowed to make noise.  When I mentioned that it had kept me away only two weeks ago he replied, \"I\\'ll inform my colleague.\"\\n\\nAs you may imagine, that was the last I heard of it and I\\'m having my second sleepless night in Fauvart.\\n\\nTruly, stay elsewhere.  Paris is full of marvellous options, this isn\\'t one of them.\\n\\nPhoto taken at 330am. Finally finished at 345am. Its now 605am and theyve been dismantling for the past 2 hours and 20 mins, banging and crashing and yelling the whole time. Helpful and friendly staff. Rooms are nice and clean. Updated bathrooms are welcome. Mid afternoon cake and snacks are great addition. Location is perfect  can walk to restaurants, train, groceries in a few minutes. The area felt safe. Again shout out to the staff members who are really helpful.', '7_영업시간': 'no operation time', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

This hotel is not only cute but in the perfect location. We were able to walk or take public transportation to all the major tourist attractions while also seeing some of the real every day parts and places of Paris. They were able to have our room ready early which was a nice surprise. We arranged flowers, champagne, and chocolates in our room at welcome for our anniversary and the they displayed them in our room beautifully. The flowers were gorgeous and the champagne and chocolates were some of the best I have ever had. They provided us with recommended restaurants and we had some of the best meals because of the list! They staff were very helpful with sharing their recommendations for places to go and see in the area. The room was a very nice size easy to move around. Loved having the window open and listening to the sounds of Paris while we were in the room. This is definitely more of a romantic or boutique hotel but so worth it. When my husband and I are lucky enough to come back to Paris again we will stay here! The location is terrific, surrounded by terrific Parisian and world foods, great access to Metro, Seine, Notre Dame and other landmarks, but also laundry great for the longterm traveler. The staff was very friendly and housekeeping was excellent. I loved just sitting in the window bay enjoying the view of the nightlife below. The rooms are spacious enough, especially considering they are in the heart of the city. There was even an efficiency kitchen. I just wish they had more outlets! First  star rating in Paris relates to the facilities not the quality like in North America.\\n\\nSecond  it is in a fantastic location in an older section of Paris where many of the major sites are walking distance.  It has very good RER and Metro access to numerous lines within a 3 min walk.  A TON of great places to eat close by.\\n\\nThird  clean, no bugs.\\n\\nFourth  had an elevator.  Worlds smallest, but it worked think 3 large suitcases wide by 1 deep.  Claustrophobic people will not be able to use it.\\n\\nFifth  people were friendly, polite and very professional.  Was safe and secure. From arrival to departure the hotel visit was excellent. We were greeted and checked in as soon as we arrived and were taken to our room so we could freshen up before heading out for food well before checkin time. The room was very comfortable with a place for everything, very comfortable bed, closet and fantastic water pressure. The location could not be better for walking and dining. Easy access to the Metro and RER. Highly recommended for friendly staff and location. Well return. We loved this hotel! It is close to everything, very comfortable and clean, and there are several restaurants around. The team, particularly Willy, was always so helpful and friendly! We would recommend this hotel to anyone, and we would stay again when visiting Paris.', '7_영업시간': 'Monday: Open 24 hours\\nTuesday: Open 24 hours\\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\\nThursday: Open 24 hours\\nFriday: Open 24 hours\\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\\nSunday: Open 24 hours', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

Nestled in the vibrant Marais district, I was surrounded by chic boutiques, cozy cafs, and historic sites. It was easy to explore the city on foot, and public transportation was just a short walk away.\\nThe room itself was quite tiny, which is typical for Parisian accommodations. Despite the size, it had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.\\nWhat truly made my stay memorable was the staff. They were incredibly helpful and friendly, always ready to offer recommendations and assistance. Their warm hospitality added a personal touch to my visit.\\n\\nIn summary, if you're looking for a central location and friendly service in Paris, this hotel is a great choice. Just be prepared for a snug room, and youll be all set for a fantastic stay! I'm not sure how this hotel has such high ratings. I would imagine that if you visit this hotel during colder months it would be okay.\\n\\nI felt that I was profiled by the receptionist, being a solo male traveller. Before assigning my room, the receptionist consulted with housekeeping staff. I believe I was given the worst room in the hotel based on being a solo male traveller, room 17. As you can see from the photos, the inside room temperature was almost 30 degrees Celsius at around noon. I wanted to open my window, as the outside temperature was very pleasant. However, as you can see from the photos, my view was of the exhaust fan of the hotel's kitchen.\\n\\nThe provided fans did help somewhat. But again, from my photos, you can see that the fans were both caked in dust and blowing out dust bunnies. If you have dust allergies, you should avoid this place like the plague. The fans created a dust vortex in the room to the point where I felt I was coughing up a lung and my eyes were swollen.\\n\\nAfter the first night, I booked at the Courtyard and forfeited the remaining 2 nights at this property, as I booked on Expedia, and the hotel had a no refund policy. Thankfully, I had some points to redeem. I'm convinced that the positive reviews here are fake reviews. The emails from Marie Courier also seem fake and must be the alias of the gentleman working at reception. Stayed 4 nights and the location was perfect! Great restaurants near by and super walkable to get around Paris! Staff was super friendly! And bonus that for our fam of 4 2 teens, 2 adults our room had 2 twin beds so kids didn't have to share!  Would definitely stay here again. My friend and i had this hotel reccomended, we were extremly disappointed. it is nothing like as shown on the website.\\nthe room was very small the ensuite too small even for one person.we stayed only one night at a greater expense we found another Hotel around the corner which was four start and not a lot of difference in the price.the only positive thing i can say is the room and ensuite were clean, other wise the whole hotel needs a refurbishment. The breakfast room is nothing like it is shown on the website.i agree with other reviews i cannot understand how it gets high reviews. This hotel was unacceptable. The price gauging for the olympics may have lead me to book a lesser hotel than i would have got in this price range ordinarily and perhaps i should have spent more for a better hotel but the rooms are tiny and run down. All members of staff are rude or inconsiderate barring one lovely young man who checked me in and was there on occasion on front desk. There is no AC, there is no curtain or blinds for the bathroom window, the room has to be under 100 square foot its genuinely that small, the shower is either unbearably hot or too cold and when you finally get it right youll get a random blast of hot water come through without touching anything, all of the walls are paper thin i had little to no sleep thanks to screaming babies and hearing everything on the hotel floor, the stairs are not safe to walk down they are so wonky, i asked in the survey they sent me before arrival that my room would not be cleaned for the duration of the stay and this was ignored by the cleaners every single day, who would try and force entry even if i was asleep or in the shower, theyd wake me up and only take no for an answer after insisting repeatedly which was creepy, even when i was not present at all they moved all of my belongings around the room. They confiscate your hotel key whenever you leave, but lock the door at night so if you return from a club or bar you have to stand outside and knock, eventually they come and act surprised and annoyed that you dare come back so late, as if theyre your parents or something. I was told a different check out time but then they enforced the normal checkout time so after having a very late night thinking i had more time to check out the next day, i was awoken by a rude obnoxious man who said you must leave in the next 10 minutes then suddenly didnt understand english when i responded, saying WHAT?! as if to mock the fact im english, i dont understand your accent. WHAATTTTTT?!!! before stressing me minutes later you have to leave immediately get down here and then telling me off and laughing in the lobby infront of guests when i checked out. Because of this if it wasnt for a friends hotels kindness i would have had to walk around paris with my bags for hours before my flight. How theyre reviewed so highly i have no idea. I guess it was clean and i didnt have any of my stuff go missing.\", '7_영업시간': 'Monday: Open 24 hours\\nTuesday: Open 24 hours\\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\\nThursday: Open 24 hours\\nFriday: Open 24 hours\\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\\nSunday: Open 24 hours', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

What a magical time! I stayed there with my husband during our getaway to Paris for our wedding anniversary, and I couldn't have imagined a better choice for a Marriott hotel. The cleanliness, the decor, and the architecture inside the building are absolutely stunning. But above all, it's the staff that truly makes the difference. The entire reception team, as well as the concierges, were so kind and welcoming. I especially want to give a special mention to Nathan, who welcomed us and followed up with us throughout our stay. He was incredibly helpful.\\n\\nWe had a problem with the tablet in the room, we couldn't turn down the TV. We reported it to the reception team who responded immediately. When we returned, the problem was solved. I also enjoyed my experience at the bar, although it was a bit underwhelming. Still it was great experiences.\\n\\nThe hotel is located just 0.1 miles from the Champslyses, which made our stay even more enjoyable for strolling around and dining out. The hotel also has a gym in the basement and typically a spa, which unfortunately was under renovation. That said, we don't dwell on the negatives given the unforgettable experience we had.\\n\\nWe will definitely be back for our next stay in the French capital!!! This hotel is very well located next to ChampsElysee, with easy access to metro station. Hotel rooms are spacious and well decorated. I had a wonderful experience staying there for my family vacation.  The staff members went above and beyond to provide excellent service to make our vacation pleasant and special. As titanium member, we received great room upgrade and the breakfast was very nice. Thank Benjamin, Kahima, and more! Absolutely spectacular service from April  one of Concierge  from all of the Concierge staff and the entire staff at the hotel. The sweet upgrade was spectacular, the room perfectly and unruly maintained. We had some issues with luggage that didnt even concern the hotel, but they went above and beyond to assist. As a traveler, and a travel professional? I would 100 recommend them. The location is handy but not much to do onsite. We also had problems pretty much since we arrived  1 on Day 1 the key creation system was not working, so we could not use the elevator or access our room without a staff member accompanying us each time, 2 later that day the television system totally quit working throughout the hotel still down 48 hours later , and 3 there are ongoing problems that further limit our enjoyment. The spa is totally shutdown. The lights in the room are computer controlled and seem to turn on and off at random times, both day and night.  The room smells of sewer drain each time we shower. The shower water also comes out and leaves water on the floor.  No wash cloths in the bathroom . We cant open curtain because people from offices across street stare right into the room. Rooms are very small. There is only one luggage holder rack for one suitcase and we are two  really nowhere to put anything. The staff members are all wonderful and very understanding, but they have a hard job. This is the first Luxury Collection hotel at which we have stayed, but so far the luxury part seems to be completely missing.  The staff and breakfast buffet are outstanding, but we find hotel staff always wonderful at all Marriott hotels we stay at. It is hard to justify and to understand what makes this hotel luxury and the cost it has given all these problems. What a lovely property! The hotel and rooms are beautiful. The service is better! April and the rest of the concierge staff made my stay truly special. I was traveling alone, and they were all very kind and attentive.  They went above and beyond to ensure I had a lovely holiday!\", '7_영업시간': 'no operation time', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

So glad to have stumble upon it. Perfect location and impeccably clean. Rooms are small but the layout maximize space and you dont feel like you need more. Staff were so friendly and decorations were classy. Highly highly recommend Never explored Paris so effortlessly. When we say a hotel that makes you definitely visit next time is must be services good, sleep well and energy in daytime. Suit for city explorer and even you can explore quite a bit in the hotel. Tea in lobby really nice for a exclusive appointment with friends in Le Maris but not overwhelming by the crowds. Everything was great. The rooms were comfortable and clean though a little small but its a boutique so that was expected. The bathrooms have nice huge tubs which was a plus after walking all day. The common areas were so cool and inviting, and the staff was helpful without being over the top about it. We chose not to take the breakfast. There are many spots outside with lots of options. The place is one of the most lovely hotel Ive ever been to. Its what I call luxury quiet meaning that its beautiful and luxurious without doing too much. I loved the junior suite with the beautiful bathtub, the wood around the bed. The little outdoor terrasse downstairs.\\nExtra 5 starts for the service and the staff members who were just adorable.\\nAll of this in the heart of Paris in le Marais. Will definitely come back ! It was the perfect place to explore and relax  a very intimate and discreet hotel in the heart of marais. With cozy bathtubs and vinyls. Truly a delight, will come back soon ', '7_영업시간': 'Monday: 12:00\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200911:50\\u202fPM\\nTuesday: 12:00\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200911:50\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 12:00\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200911:50\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 12:00\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200911:50\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 12:00\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200911:50\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 12:00\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200911:50\\u202fPM\\nSunday: 12:00\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200911:50\\u202fPM', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

Rooms are small as is typical in Paris, but very clean, comfortable and pleasant. AC makes the space a cool and quiet retreat. Walking distance from Metro, Seine River, many Restaurants. We had a family suite with adjoining rooms.  The staff was gracious and helpful and let us check in early when we arrived after an overnight flight.  Great location next to Jardin du Luxembourg DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!\\nTried to charge us more up front until we showed him the price we  booked. He still wanted more money but we refused!\\nWORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! Bed broke when sat on it. Rooms are tiny, if you are travelling with kids they will give you cots that  collapse with wood bottom and no blankets.had to demand mattress and was told blankets only for adults  had to take blankets off another room with no help. When the concierge didnt know how to put up cots he  left us to figure it out, then was told not his problem. Breakfast room is in the reception lobby. Breakfast is expensive and not worth it. No fridge in rooms shower is tiny and bathroom can fit only 1 person at a time  The floors in the rooms are also  uneven and on tilted slants. We had 3 rooms and they were all the same. We would never stay here again.\\nTERRIBLE HTEL!!! TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!\\nPHOTOS DO NOT LOOK LIKE THE ROOMS!!!! The location is good and quiet at night. We had a room located towards the theater and enjoyed our sleep and view. The staff was friendly and let me leave something in their fridge overnight. There is always someone at the desk, even at one am. The hotel feels safe, and there is a small elevator. Some things to note are the rooms have one USB and one usbc charging port, there is no microwave or fridge in the room. I felt the superior room was spacious enough for two, but of course much smaller than I am used to. The shower room is small too, even for the superior room. We recently stayed at Hotel Michelet Odon, and its location is absolutely fantastic for walking and exploring Paris. The rooms and bathrooms were modern and clean, which made for a comfortable stay. Though the rooms were quite small, it was a reasonable tradeoff given the prime location. The only downside was that the wifi in the room wasn't great. I would definitely stay here again when I return to Paris in the future. very bad rooms and bad attitude at the reception. they force you to leave the key whenever you are leaving the room for security purposes. at 7 in the morning the housekeeper started to make a lot of noise so we could not rest as we wished. the price of the room can ONLY be justified by the location, but nothing more.\", '7_영업시간': 'Monday: Open 24 hours\\nTuesday: Open 24 hours\\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\\nThursday: Open 24 hours\\nFriday: Open 24 hours\\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\\nSunday: Open 24 hours', '8_유형': 'lodging, point_of_interest, establishment', '출처': 'Google Places'} \n",

Its a classic boutique hotel that for me really shows the Parisian experience the only thing is the elevator is small so if need a more accessible way for wheelchairs and what not Id say ask Adorable hotel in great location with plenty of delicious restaurants and great shopping nearby. Room was small and shower oddly did not have a curtain. But other than that we loved staying here! Left the hotel after a 1 night stay. Price for my 6th floor, room 29 for the night was very reasonable at 115 euro. 3 minute walk from metro stop. Lovely and safe area in Paris. Rumour has it that Henry Miller the writer stayed at room 29 for an extended period of time so that's a bonus. Lift was very small and can only fit one person with luggage. Did not bother me. Very easy to get to the hotel from Gare du Nord. Just hop on the metro number 4 and you will be able to reach the hotel in 20 minutes. Basic 2 or 3 star hotel. Clean, friendly staff, good size room for Paris. Tiny liftelevator but to be expected. Beds comfortable. If you are looking for a budget friendly hotel this could be it. I stayed at the Htel Bonaparte based off of Rick Steves' recommendation in his guidebook. Very helpful staff as well as a spacious room.  I came to appreciate how close the hotel is to public transportation.
