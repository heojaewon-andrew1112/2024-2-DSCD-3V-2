The Central Park North,"137 W 111th St, New York, NY 10026, USA",3.9,40.7997535,-73.9536023,"Shower was really back. There was not enough pressure on the shower and it seemed a bath room from 1975. Location wise it is not bad but once youre there you may find yourself in a little catchy area. Its not the best of the neighbourhoods even though its right next to the Central Park A great option for someone who wants to stay in Manhattan for a fair price. Each floor is accessible by stairs and there is a shared bathroom and shower on each level.

The cleaning service was consistent so all the amenities were kept clean. The rooms have everything you could need for a pleasant stay and the building itself holds lots of New York charm! Really lovely staff, nice rooms and nice bathrooms. The shared bathroom thing was not an issue, and they were very clean. The location isn't the most ideal it's bordering on East Harlem, which can get a bit sketchy, but a great deal for a place in manhattan. If you're parking in East Harlem to avoid the street parking they offer, I recommend ubering instead of doing the walk with your luggage.

Would definitely come back again though! Lots of TV channels, nice little kitchen area and the beds were clean and comfy. Absolutely not a safe area! A half a block to the east was the most unsafe corner we were at for the entirety of a week exploring nearly every part of NYC. The space is comparable to a motel. Very basic hotel type room except that we chose a larger room with more beds. The room was incredibly hot when we arrived and the halls and bathrooms were hot the whole stay. Theres mold or mildew in the room that caused us bad headaches and other horrible allergy symptoms from the moment we arrived at the room each day. The beds and furniture are incredible cheap, drawers were broken, scratched or wouldnt even open. The cheap metal beds had completely ruined the hardwood floors which is a shame. The beds were very uncomfortable and the pillows were awful and flat. The internet was slow. Sharing bathrooms was totally fine except for a certain hour each day, which is totally understandable and we worked around it. However, theres nowhere to even rinse a spoon off during that time and the bathrooms werent kept stocked with paper towels and ran out of toilet paper due to the amount of people using them. We didnt ask for room service, but their instructions contradicted themselves, so they chose to enter our room certain days but didnt leave the basics they took and could see we used like washcloths, coffee, creamer, etc. The noise level of other guests and staff in the hall specifically was ridiculous. The amount of street noise was to be expected, but for sure way too loud at times and could be avoided with better insulation, double pane windows. Our door didnt close all the way and they had our lock screwed open on the handle.
Their staff wasnt barely friendly. Theres no way to contact them except email unless youre in the building between 10 and 6, why bother?

A few things that would have made my review 4 stars
Put a shelf in the bathroom for our clothing so it doesnt get drenched by the shower with the tiny cloth curtain that sprays all over the floor no matter what you do.
Provide a trash in the shower room.
Fix the doors so they actually close and are safe.
Replace the doorknobs, simple cheap fix so theyre safe and not so cheap and wobbly.
Replace the toilet paper holder or tighten it, just tacky.
Provide a wash basin at the very least. How do we rinse dishes?
Upgrade your internet.
Put casters under the furniture to save those gorgeous floors.
Be quieter in the hallway.
Provide the basics, coffee and supplies every day, paper towels in the room, and enough towels when you take ours that are hanging up which you said you wouldnt do.
Lastly, get rid of the mold and mildew. Im personally never this sick from exposure to it.   We didnt have these same breathing issues in the subway we do from your room. Its on a cute street super close to Central Park, which is convenient for walking and taking public transit. The mold issue in the building needs to be addressed. Simple upgrades would go a long way toward actual comfort for guests too. Loved the NYC true apartment feel and charm of the outside of the building.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Hampton Inn Ridgefield Park,"100 US-46, Ridgefield Park, NJ 07660, USA",3.8,40.8447094,-74.0148318,"great stay. nicely located. rooms were updated and clean. hot breakfast was yummy. absolute best part of our stay was front desk agent Fred! I can tell Fred is genuinely dedicated to helping people and cares about making sure you have a great stay. thank you Fred!! My biggest complaint was no hot water. We changed rooms twice and lukewarm was as good as it got. Rooms were actually very clean though. I basically waited an hour for maintenance at like 11pm for the water situation only to be changed rooms with no additional hot water in the next room.

Additionally, they allow people smoking weed in the parking lot at 1011pm and then their children were so loud that multiple people requested a new room on a new floor. I was pleasantly surprised with this stay! We did the park and ride for the Manhattan Port for our cruise. The rooms were clean, there is a small pool and fitness center and included breakfast. In addition the bus to and from the port was very very easy. I was worried from other reviews but I have no idea what their problem was because we had no issues. Be on time and youll be fine. The staff were friendly. We had 3 people and 5 pieces of luggage no problem at all. We did indicate there was 3 people not 2 when we booked where it indicated and we literally had no problems. I will 100 book this again for any cruise going from Manhattan it was cost effective and again very easy to get to and from the dock. If youre leaving for a cruise I would do this vs parking near the port so much less stressful! One downside is the turn to get into the hotel is hard because of the highway merge.

Disclaimer my brothers car emblem was stolen off his car while it was parked in the hotel lot no one elses car was vandalized. Im not taking a star away because this can happen anywhere but do keep this in mind its not monitored so park at your own risk. The hotel did not compensate him nor did we expect them to We stayed one night. The problems 1, the sink and shower both had no water pressure , only a little water, and the water was not warm.
2, All the juices at breakfast were watered down and tasted very weird.
There was more water in the juice than in the shower!.
Never go again there. We stayed here for the Park and Go Cruise Package.

Pros the shuttle service was very efficient and easy. The hotel rented a larger charter bus so there was plenty of space for everyone and their luggage. Loading at the hotel was very easy, getting our luggage at the port was very efficient. When we returned the bus was waiting and again, was very easy to get back to the hotel.

The breakfast was wellstocked not a ton of options, but what was there was plentiful.

The room itself was nice and clean, the bed was quite comfortable.

Cons

Our car was vandalized while we were gone. Someone came and pried the emblems off the car and left very deep scratches. Yes there are signs up that ""absolve"" the hotel of any damage to your vehicle, but the front desk staff was not at all helpful even when we called the police to get a report for insurance purposes. Make sure to park directly adjacent to the building. I'm not sure if it would have helped, but we were in the outer row.

Getting into the hotel is a nightmare. I read the reviews ahead of time and thought 'it can't be that bad'. It is. The traffic to get off on the exit backs up half a mile and it took us 20 minutes to go that last little bit. Just be prepared.

Food and drink options are minimal nothing really in driving distance, particularly given the traffic mentioned above. We were able to get door dash eventually high fee for delivery, however there was no option to get any sort of alcoholic beverage. Also keep in mind that once you are on the turnpike there are few options as well. I would prepare ahead of time and stop at a grocery store or food place before arrival.

The rooms on the side of the hotel near the highway are VERY loud road noise even late at night. Recommend requesting a room on the south side of the building.


Prior to our car being vandalized we had felt certain we would stay at this hotel again if we were going to be taking another cruise, but i'm not sure where we land now.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hotel Executive Suites,"30 Minue St, Carteret, NJ 07008, USA",3.4,40.5906024,-74.2388923,"Worst customer service ever!!!
We checked out at 1030am and forgot a pouch in the washroom. We called at 2pm to inquire about it and they told us to call back. We called back at 8pm and the lady was soooo unprofessional. She wasn't even checking the lost amd found. And kept on saying that we should call tomorrow. Apparently, they don't have any procedure if a customer forgets something in the room.

Beware. No one should go there!! Two stars is kind.  Let me walk you through this hotel, it had a weird smell and the room smelled even weirder and I have never smelled whatever that was before.  There was a girl working the desk who was just kind of mean.  The furniture in the room was stained, the room didn't look dirty but felt dirty, I could be imagining that, it needs a good remodel.  The bed was super uncomfortable. The numbers for rooms in the hall were in a weird order, and there is a highway behind it so you hear driving all night. Was placed at this hotel after a canceled flight  it was close to the airport. The only restaurant on the premises was closed and not in use . There was a pantry with food items to purchase e.g. microwave meals, cakes, White Castle burgers, small ice creams, sodas 3 and water 2, unfortunately there was nothing complementary .  The room was fair , it was clean and the bed was comfortable. It needs much updating and was missing the modern conveniences. The lobby and the bathroom in the lobby were updated. The rooms were not. There was coffee and hot water for tea in the lobby . It is an older hotel and as I stated earlier it was offered after a cancellation so it was much better than spending the night at the airport. I stayed here recently and it was subpar. No matter how many people are in your room, theyll only give you two towels! The elevators and common areas had a constant smoke smell. FYI they only serve coffee in the morning. The rooms are pretty old and definitely need an update, especially the carpet. It's a decent place if you just need a basic hotel, but there are definitely some improvements needed. I recently stayed at the Executive Suites Hotel and was very impressed with the service. The front desk and housekeeping staff were both extremely efficient and responsive. The room was spotless and wellmaintained. Based on this experience, I will definitely be choosing this hotel for my future stays. Highly recommend!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Central Hotel,"415 38th St, Union City, NJ 07087, USA",3.6,40.774846,-74.0264488,"An excellent hotel that left us with the most pleasant impressions! The main advantage is that it is only 20 minutes from Manhattan, which is very convenient for those who want to enjoy New York without long trips. I would especially like to note the work of the administration. When it became necessary to extend our stay, and almost all the rooms were occupied, they met us halfway and found the best option. The rooms are cozy, equipped with everything you need the refrigerator and microwave became a real salvation. The reception staff is always polite and responsive, special thanks to Peter for his help and care! If you want to stay outside of Manhattan, it is a very good option. The treatment with the Hotel, from the beginning, was very good, they kept in constant friendly communication, even letting us know that the room was ready. We stayed in a very clean private room, with bathroom, microwave, refrigerator, AC, TV, hair dryer. We had doubts before visiting the place, especially because on other occasions we have stayed in Manhattan, but the truth is, we were very satisfied with the location, since it was very easy to get there and back, even in the early morning. They give you all the information if you have any questions, so that in 15 minutes, depending on traffic, you can go and come from the Hotel to the whereabouts of The Port Authority of New York in Manhattan, super easy. Oh and by the way, their candy vending machine saved us when we were craving snacks, very late. Thanks for everything! I feel very lucky I found this unique hotel as I was walking around Union City one day.   The staff was very welcoming and the location was steps away from buses to jersey city and NYC.
Coffee shops, restaurants and stores very near too.  But most of all was the kind staff, the clean rooms, the various options to stay there, and the other tenants I met were great people! Visit NYC with my son for the first time, and this hotel is well located a few minutes from manhattan. Simple and clean and the staff were so friendly and helpful. Stayed here for a couple days, and so far this hotel seems to not know what theyre doing. Maintenance is atrocious and they mess up everything they do. The guy painting the stairs managed to mess up installation of the stairs threads, as well as closing off the stairs which is a fire safety issue. If youre gonna do work hire competent contractors.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
The Washington by LuxUrban,"8 Albany St, New York, NY 10006, USA",4,40.7093315,-74.0137607,"Pros location is great, customer service was attentive.
Cons room was run down, showed many signs of wear and tear as well as moldmildew in the shower. The shower was also visible from the room so any other guests staying with you could see you showering. On a very busy weekend only one elevator was working therefore getting down to check out was an incredible hassle as there are many floors in this hotel. Another issue was the temperature in the room. Although there was a thermostat, regardless of how much lower you changed the temperature the room would not get colder than 72 degrees which was warm for multiple adults in a small room getting ready for events. We called and someone was sent to fix it. It was not fixed. Would not stay again or recommend. We were slightly apprehensive of our booking given some of the reviews but very glad we stayed here. Can't beat the view, amazing location and cost compared to other big name hotel chains.
Our room was clean, the bed comfortable, and the shower water pressure was good. Our room had a combination safe for valuables, a mini fridge, and ample closet space.

I agree with other reviews that some areas could use some updating and minor maintenance. However, you don't vacation in New York to stay in the hotel room and we were out all day, so no big deal. The bathroom lighting does need to be brighter and there's not enough counter space. However, we found these to be minor things.

The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. We arrived late morning and Micayah sorry if I've mispelled! worked out an early checkin and room with a terrific view for us and she answered all of our questions. Housekeeping staff kept our room nice and tidy for our 5 day stay.

Overall we would stay at The Washington again when in New York. Just returned from a 5 day stay at this hotel. No complaints from us , the location is fantastic with views to die for day and night. Beds are super comfy with nice sheets.
Bathroom is a decent size, clean and a good shower.
Staff aren't very interested in the guests and more interested in looking at their phones.
We just wanted a place to put our heads down after a long day of site seeing and this hotel was ideal for that.
I would highly recommend it , the area around here is so peaceful to come back to on an evening. SCAM!!!
I had an extremely disappointing and frustrating experience The Washington Hotel that I feel compelled to share to warn others.

In May, I attempted to book a stay at this hotel through their website. Despite providing my credit card details, I never received any confirmation of the bookingno email, no booking number, nothing. Naturally, I assumed that the booking was unsuccessful.

Fast forward three months later, I noticed a significant charge of more than 1,000 on my credit card from this hotel. Shocked, I immediately contacted the hotel to request a refund, only to be informed that my nonrefundable reservation had been confirmed and also been cancelled obviously not on my side .

Whats even more concerning is that I only received a booking confirmation after I requested a refund. This delayed confirmation, sent three months after the supposed booking date, appears to be a tactic to justify keeping my money, despite their prior communication confirming the cancellation.

I had no choice but to book another hotel, as I couldnt rely on a reservation that was never properly communicated to me. The hotels refusal to issue a refund and their inconsistent, delayed responses have left me with no option but to file a dispute with my bank.

If you value transparent communication and ethical business practices, I strongly urge you to think twice before booking with this hotel. My experience has been nothing short of a scam, and I wouldnt want anyone else to go through the stress and financial loss that I have endured. This hotel is unfortunately falling apart. It was tolerable for our short 3 day stay but not very comfortable and lacking amenities
 Rooms are incredibly dim
 3 of our 5 lamps or lights were brokennot working
 House cleaning does not replenish toiletries, you have to ask when you run out of shampooconditioner
 TV and phone in the room did not work. If you need to speak to the front desk, you have to go all the way downstairs to do it in person.
 Walls full of scratches, scuff marks, peeling paint, broken blinds, loose wires and electric cables, etc
Shower has a glazed glass wall looking into the bedroom so everyone in the room can see the person showering this is insane

In my opinion it's not worth the price.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Pod 51,"230 E 51st St, New York, NY 10022, USA",4.1,40.7557851,-73.9690935,"Stayed for a couple of nights, felt I got what I expected. It's budget accommodation, there are some compromises in terms of room size, shared bathroom. But everything was clean and worked, staff were pleasant. Location is very good, which is the main reason for selection.  Was easily 100night cheaper than alternatives, as long as the value remains good, I'd happily stay again Perfect hotel for a NYC stay! Location is very convenient to subway, Rockefeller center, St Patrick's cathedral, Times square, not too far away. Nice selection of restaurants just steps away, rooms are just all you need for a comfortable stay! Rooftop views are amazing!! I think given its price, proximity to a few key train lines, good area food options, and the cleanliness of our room, it's a pretty good spot to stay. There was one glaring issue with our room that just boggles my mind and that is the combo bathroomshower glass sliding door coloration.
Imagine you're three people staying in a room with beds for three and the combo bathroomshower module has a sliding door with frosted glass and a static wall for the shower that's just...clear. How can anyone shower or drop a deuce without the others seeing it? Why not just frost the other glass, or run a curtain along the whole thing? It was a nutty choice of the hotel to design it this way. Very good location of the hotel in midtown Manhattan, from where after a long walk you can get to some of the most famous attractions of New York.
The hotel itself, despite the repainted walls, still remembers the bygone days. Unfortunately, the rooms look like prison cells. Very small area with bunk beds. If one wakes up in the night, one can shatter one's head. In this small space they still fit a sink in the room.
The view from the window of the buildings in very close proximity.
The lack of a bathroom is a disaster these days. A shared bathroom with a shower is on the first floor, which is also used by other guests.
The staff was unpleasant, as if they forgot that they are the ones living off the guests' money.
On the plus side, there's certainly a phenomenal rooftop view of the Manhattan skyline and a relatively low price for New York although I prefer to pay and sleep in human conditions.
In the hallway on our floor we twice encountered people sleeping on the floor !. Unfortunately left early because saw some cockroaches and couldnt stop thinking about it. One huge one on the AC, and small ones in shower two days in a row  the front desk person was so nice and came to save me and kill the giant cockroach, so thank you!

The room actually was quite clean so seeing then was surprising. Location also sooooo good and close to tons of great food and the subway.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Carlton Arms Hotel,"160 E 25th St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.1,40.7401607,-73.9826293,"We arrive at the hotel, we open the front door and immediately we feel that a very special atmosphere is hidden here.
A cuddly cat is lying in front of the first floor corridor, next to the reception area filled with all kinds of artistic oddities, he seems to be serenely surveying the place.
A more than cool manager gives us the key to our room which is located on the second floor, we go there without waiting.
The more I walk towards our room, the more I discover all kinds of paintings, each more intriguing than the other, and that's when I realize that this hotel can be visited unlike any other hotel I've ever been to. sleeping until now.
This place which gives off a completely perched atmosphere cannot in any way suit anyone who is looking for great comfort or who is obsessed with the slightest dirt.
In corridors worthy of squats, in those pharaonic ones, passing by common showers with door handles which hold by the operation of the Holy Spirit I already know that I will experience a unique and unforgettable moment between these four walls  A very quirky, unique old hotel. Located in a mall where a large university is. Lots of stairs to reception and rooms. The location is great as lots of bars and eateries close by. Not far from the underground so easy to get around. John at reception is a super lovely guy and very helpful. Great for a budget stay. I stayed there with some friends for a few days and loved the concept and staff, but hated that it was so dirty. We thought about changing hotel but our budget did not allow for a last minute change.
The curtains and carpets where terribly dusty and stained there was mold and bugs in the bathroom and I wont talk about the filthy shower curtain.
My throat was itchy every time I was in the bedroom. Special mention for the huge gaps around the doors that allowed us to perfectly hear our neighbor on the toilet

Its a shame because I had sympathy for this hotel. Its weird in a good way, very well located and cheap. Unfortunately its falling into disrepair. I booked a twin single occupant room with a shared bathroom and it went well! Definitely take the time to look through some of the pictures to see if youll be ok with the hotel. It came down to a good deal for me based on price, location, safety and availability. Shared bathroom was clean and the art was entertaining. They were flexible with my late arrival and have luggage storage. We checked in and left less than two hours later to a new hotel after what we had seen. Dont think its just a quirky artsy boutique hotel. The rooms are in really bad shape, they smell, doors dont always lock well, bathrooms dont look clean at all and are rusty in many places. The beds were all dirty and with stains, showing they had not been cleaned recently some still had pieces of tissues in between layers. The staff was nice and try to accommodate with different rooms, but they all had major issues that made us think that losing the first night costs and paying a new hotel, last minute, in NY, was still a better choice",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Dirty , unsafe and so uncomfortable rooms. Imagine you will not be provided with room keys and the staff will always go to unlock your room. Expired flattened mattress and shaking bed for uncomfortable sleep. Smelly dirty decades old smallest washroom. No facilities in hostel. No wifi signals beyond 1st floor. Worst arrogant staff having no answers to your complaints. Once thf hostel was without any staff for several hours in the early morning and a guest had no option to get to his room because he didn't have keys. There were no towels in whole hostel for 2 days. 2 person lift was so unsafe. No refund policy on cancellation despite fraud pictures on platform. Overall it was a nightmare and the property must be delisted to save others. Absolutely not. It looks NOTHING like the photos they have posted. Its literally worse than jail. Ive been to jail. This is way worse. No AC, dirty as hell, everything smells. They have t swept or mopped a floor in there since the 60s. Its the single worst building Ive ever been into in my life. The worst hostel I have been in.
They woke me up at 2.30 a.m. because they give me the wrong room. Then, they gave me another room, but there wasn't space for me, again. Finally they could find, after almost half an hour, a bed for me. They didn't give me sleeves and there wasn't a pillow. They woke up the other guest of the room and asked him about the pillow. No respect for the guests.

They promised me a refund, but nothing to do. They told me to wait the day after, I called them and they told me to wait a couple of weeks. After 1 year I still have't got my money back. Worst Hostel Ive ever been. They didnt have enough blankets for all the guests so we had to sleep with the jackets on because it was really cold.
There were cockroaches in the room, rooms were dirty, staff unhelpful but the worst part is that someone entered our room while we were outside and used our towels and pillows and left everything dirty. The staff did not help at all and did not compensate for anything. Awful experience The worst hostel ever! Im literally stayed outside over an hour freezing because nobody opened the door for me! After a long time someone showed up and opened it. I asked why that happened and they ignored me! I asked twice and they ignored my question. The rooms are terrible! Bathroom dirty!!

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Fort Lee - George Washington Bridge,"2117 Route 4 Eastbound, Fort Lee, NJ 07024, USA",3.8,40.8603103,-73.9768481,"It's too bad we can't give half stars, because I'd give this place a 3.5.

The staff is very good, very friendly and supportive, given the location they work in.

A few points
 the food at the restaurant is quite good, and the portions are quite large. The wait staff is also very good and exceptionally attentive. No complaints with that at all.

 the cookies are a nice touch. They're warm and pretty good. I don't feel so bad for them giving me diabetes because they're so tasty.

 the rooms are relatively clean, with the exception of the wall plugsusb outlets, which, for lack of a better way of explaining it, are hairy I've attached a picture. I almost feel my USB cord needs protection being plugged into this.

 the showers are terrible. The water pressure is as strong as cat piss. I've had better water pressure at a 20night hostel in Peru. The shower head looks like it hasn't been cleaned since the Obama administration, and it's starting to compete with Lady Liberty for deepest copper green... On top of that, the faucet is falling off.

 I forgot to bring a UV light, so couldn't check for stains, but the room looks pretty clean, and no major stinks or anything.

 the elevators sound like they're about to die. Not one of them, all of them. The sounds don't really inspire confidence going up.  Video attached, turn on the sound.

Hopefully the Hilton sees this and fixes these problems. If it helps, I was at room 1106 on October 8, 2024. Sam working the late night at the front desk was very helpful and apologetic and handled it well. He and the Latino hostwaiter at the restaurant older gentleman were the service highlight of the stay, give these guys raises, they're good people you should keep. My husband booked this room. Had I read the reviews, I would have never selected this hotel.
This hotel is exactly how the others describe it. Dated, dated, dated. The 80's called, they want their style back.
We were first put in a room that the ac was not working. We asked to switch and they did so without hesitation.
The second room, while spacious, it seemed clean, but looking at it closer, there were food crumbs on the floor next to the bed and sound of dripping water all night.
I am glad we were here just to catch some shut eye for a few hours before hitting the road again. I do not recommend this place. It needs a major overhaul.
The gentleman at the front desk was pleasant.
This hotel has definitely seen better days. The soundproofing is terrible. I could clearly hear conversations from the room next door and the constant sound of doors opening and closing all night long, which seriously disrupted my sleep. It was incredibly frustrating.

To add to the inconvenience, the hair conditioner was missing on the first day of my stay. I didnt realize it until I was already in the shower, which made the situation even worse. As a Diamond member, I expected a much better experience and attention to detail.

Hopefully, these issues get addressed for future guests. Disappointed with this stay overall.  Here were the issues I had
I picked out my room online when I checked in.  When I went to the counter to get a key, I was told that the room I selected wasn't available because it hadn't been cleaned yet.  It was 7pm.  Why was the room available as an option if it wasn't available?  So, I was put in a different room on the same floor.
AC  the AC stopped working 2 hours into my trip.  The room was 80 degrees when I got back from dinner.  They did send up someone from maintenance to ""fix"" it.  The fix was temporary.  The room was 80 degrees in the middle of the night again.
Shower  almost no water pressure.
The room did come with a refrigerator.  But the door you have to open to get into the fridge dragged along that carpet and was hard to open.
Location  although this isn't the fault of the hotel, beware.  It's located in one of those spots that you can't actually get to without driving past it multiple times.  It feels like you have to travel in a Z pattern to get to, repeatedly.
Staff was nice.  No free breakfast and no baggage carts located in the lobby.  Had to make multiple trips from car to room.  They do have a really nice restaurant in the lobby though.  So there's that.  Will not be staying here again. I stayed at your location in Fort Lee NJ. Friday 8232024 into 82424, just a one night stay but I'm happy it was only one night. The experience at your hotel well extremely embarrassing to the double tree name and even more for the amount you guys are charging per night. The basic needs of a hotel was barely met, staff was amazing I will get that out the way but the property itself should be closed for renovation. The AC unit not working longer than a few hours is ridiculous. Having to call your securitymaintenancehouse keeper ever few hours to rest set the system is ridiculous in the year 2024 along from us being in America vs a third world country. List of things that were extremely below budget such as the doors to the furniture lose and uneven. The security door latch not screwed in fully, the toilet seat being lose, using would to balance the furniture in the room but not taking the time to hide it made me feel as though i was in a motel.

I did ask to switch rooms, I was accommodated with, yet it wasnt much better than the last, atleast the remote worked. then to top it off i was woken up in the A.M to women screaming that your employee was sleeping with there husband! while at work! i have it on video as every one on the floor woke up and stuck there heads out to see whats goin on. I paid for a hotel experience but got the a low rated motel experience. the rooms seemed clean though. I arrived at the hotel at around 730 p.m. to find out that the hotel has canceled my reservation without even calling me. They were sold out. This people are so unprofessional and greedy. They do not care about customer service. They run my credit card even though they advertise themselves as reserve now pay at the property. I will not recommend this place to anyone. They are disgusting and not safe. There was dirty linen right on top of the front desk, and there were several guys smoking weed on their premises. If you want to be okay, do not stay at this terrible place. Dear Mark Kaylor,
I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the service I received during my stay at your hotel, WoodSpring Suites in Linden, NJ, on August 17, 2024.

I arrived at the hotel at 1005 AM after having been checked in over the phone the night before for my prepaid reservation. Upon arrival, I had to wait until 1115 AM for the front desk agent, Danny, to finally show up. When he did, he completely disregarded my presence, prioritizing his food delivery before acknowledging me. When he finally addressed me, it was with a dismissive ""How can I help you?"" He then proceeded to handle my request for a room key without verifying my identity, which is concerning from a security standpoint.

Unfortunately, the key card provided did not work. After two unsuccessful trips back to the front desk to resolve the issue, I was told to come back down instead of being offered the courtesy of having a key brought to me. When Danny finally agreed to accompany me to my room, I was left waiting by the elevator for several minutes, only to find him eating again when I returned to the front desk to check on the delay.

When Danny and a female staff member finally arrived at my room, they discovered that the door batteries were dead. Despite their efforts, they were unable to fix the door or provide me with a working key or an alternative room. It has now been 40  minutes since this ordeal began, and I still do not have access to my room.

This entire experience has left me extremely agitated and stressed at a time when I should be able to rest and enjoy my stay. The lack of professionalism, hospitality, and basic customer service is unacceptable.

I think it is fair to receive a resolution to this matter, including appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and stress caused.

Thank you for your understanding

Sincerely,
Daniel A
My stay continued

I was in room 332 which I found out was a known problem room with its lock.   Front desk didn't bring me up a key they were going to change my room.  Front desk said they can't leave the desk as the reason for not bringing me my key or escourt me to my new room.   There where 3 people at the desk.  The next two rooms was locked and occupied.... it took me 5 tries to get  a room with a key that works and the staff was more than happy to have me keep going up and down unsuccessfully.  It seemed like they were enjoying being obstinate and not helpful.   I was the only race getting this treatment the other two men in the lobby were treated great while I was getting attitude.

I have never been treated like this ever at a hotel. I came here because my flight was cancelled and needed a place to stay.  Took a lyft from the terminal and it was 25. Really nothing around here and the hotel is fairly austere. The staff was very nice and coming in at midnight, they were busy as they reached capacity.  I stayed in a room with kitchen. But, there is no breakfast, no coffee, basically only ameneites is soap and towels. There is really nothing around the hotel for food, closest restaurant seems to be a 10 minute walk. But, it was the least expensive option in the area in the middle of the night, so i am grateful to stay here. My experience with this hotel was trouble, I had call ahead to book the room the same day around 9pm, but when I arrived at 1100pm they waited until I check in and paid for the room to tell me I had to wait an hour so they can clean my room. The woman that was at the counter was very unpleasant and unprofessional. When I got to the room, they had not changed some pillows case on the pillows.  Very disappointing after waiting on my room to be cleaned. Don't get me wrong the rooms are very nice.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Nap York Sleep Station - Central Park 24/7,"940 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,40.7656652,-73.9832325,"Seeing some reviews online kinda scared me away, but I decided to try anyways and was very glad. This is a hostel, so its to be expected but for 113 I got two hot showers, a clean toilet, a big lockerbring your own lock, clean bed, quiet bunk mates, and I even got help from the front desk about my room. Also the late night clerk named Sigh or something like that, is super cool and made me feel very comfortable and welcome! Great guy. The location Is also very great, but the immediate street is busy, but no street noise when sleeping. They also supply, soap, earplugs, and eye masks. Would use again for the price, but anymore expensive and I would probably pass, I hope they dont raise the prices. Cheers. Excellent selfcatering option for budget travellers. Checkinout couldn't have been more smooth. Staff were friendly.

For me, the option to stay on an allfemale floor was ideal. Individual pods, shower, toilet and sink area were all well maintained. Communal kitchen  lounge area is modern and inviting. Lockers are spacious, all you need is your own gymstyle padlock.

Location is superb, whether you're walking or taking the subwaybustaxi to your destination. I'd definitely stay there again. Great setup, liked the individual powerlighting in each pod and privacy screen. Rooms with good size lockers, door access code and main entry security. Having the option to leave luggage beforeafter stay an added bonus, a vending machine should you need a lock for your locker etc. and ear plugssleep masks available for free. Nice little kitchen area on each floor for basic mealteacoffee prep. Everyone very respectful of others and keeping noise down, great to be able to get a bag of laundry washed and folded for 10. All staff very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend and stay here again One of the best overnight stays I've had! After reading the reviews, I'm glad to say they were right. The checkin process was easy and the employee was very nice and friendly, which is important to me. When I entered my room, I noticed how clean it was. My pod was located on the top, but I didn't mind as it was cozy, especially because it was raining outside. Everyone in the room was very respectful and nice. Honestly, for 80, this was definitely worth it. This place was awesome, but I had a few problems, but I will start with the good. The big black security guard deserves a raise, he was so kind to me furring my stays and would sometime come out with me in the middle of the night so I could smoke without being harassed by vagrants.

American Dream Bed and Breakfast,"168 E 24th St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.3,40.7394584,-73.9831439,"This hostel was clean, nice AC unit was a plus in the room, free breakfast, great staff and customer service. But there's a lot of things they could improve on. The beds were NOT good, they were basically a box spring, all spring and no padding. There were 2 toilets on our floor which was nice but they were in a VERY small space. I know new York is known for small rooms but this was excessive. The floor would get completely soaked after your shower and there was nowhere to put your things, no hook for your towel either. If there were more places to put your things it wouldn't have been so bad. But that being said there were some pros, but just a lot they could improve on. We've stayed at European hostels before and we're accommodated much better. Great pricetovalue ratio. The room was a bit oldfashioned but clean and comfortable. There were plenty of restrooms and showers available on my floor, so I never had to wait. The staff were very helpful and welcoming. The location is superb and feels very safe. The breakfast was nice, and the staff replenished the fruits and missing items so that people coming down for breakfast later could also enjoy it. We loved our stay here! We were greeted at check in and were given a tour by a super friendly staff member. The room and the shared amenities were clean and well maintained. It was quiet and comfortable, and the free breakfast was an added bonus! The location is great and convenient for traveling to other areas of the city. Looking forward to our next stay! A clean and cozy place to stay at an affordable price. The hostel had generous amenities and a very responsive front desk. It was hot outside but the AC worked like a charm. If I could give 65 stars I would. I really wanted to like this hostel. It was priced well, in a decent location,  had pretty good reviews. Perhaps it was just my room, however the carpet was filthy, the AC unit was very dusty  appeared to be on its last toes  it never seemed to make the room cold  was SO loud  it spat out water  it sounded as if someone was constantly banging pots  pans in your ear. We ended up just opening up the window, which was both quieter  more effective. Not sure when window units were invented, but it must have been the very first model....ever.
Not to mention, there was a large metal bar just above the top bunk which meant anytime I sat up  I would bang my head very hard. I would wake up to use the restroom in the middle of the night,  would have the worstmost painful awakening. I'm shocked this hasn't been a huge issue for the hostel.
The bedframes were shaky, the pillow was very clumpy  hard  just overall a very uncomfortable stay.
That said, everyone was friendly  although I was unable to enjoy the breakfast provided, it did seem plentiful.
My recommendation, if you are able, spend a little more  stay elsewhere. I wish I did.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Ramada by Wyndham Flushing Queens,"3627 Prince St, Flushing, NY 11354, USA",4.5,40.7615639,-73.8327649,"The hotel was perfect on all levels except one there was NO body wash and the soap bar they provided was TINY. How much would it cost the hotel to provide a small bottle of body wash?
Otherwise, the staff were always polite and helpful! The room was spacious and comfortable. Best of all, NO bed bugs! That gave us such peace of mind! Not extraordinary, but a good hotel. The room had a good view of Manhattan but the window was unclean, so we could not enjoy the view. We had breakfast added with the booking. Really basic breakfast.

Had to pay a 100 deposit. Paid cash, and got it back on the day of the checkout.
There is no fridge, microwave, kettle, Safety deposit box in the room . There was an iron with a stand and a coffee maker with complimentary coffee. There was a communal microwave for everyone to use. No complimentary water though. No shops nearby to buy water. The bathroom door was faulty. The room entrance was really narrow, the light was not enough for the room. The AC was noisy. We were out most of the time, so it was good for us. We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. Great location! All the staffs are amazing, kind  helpful. We also loved the breakfast. Thank you for a great hospitality. Highly recommended!  We booked through a third party site and were pleasantly surprised at the professionalism and friendliness of the staff. This is a great place to stay. Emma, from the front desk, made  everything smooth for checkin even though we arrived a little early. As a single dad traveling with his son, small gestures make all the difference.

The location is great, and it takes about six or seven minutes to get to the Flushing Main Street metro station. There's lots of food nearby, including all the important fast foods, and tons of Asian restaurants, and a couple pizza places. Asian markets line line the nearby Main Street

There is a Duane Reade nearby, a Macy's, and a Target. You can also take the Long Island railroad out to Long Island or into the city from a nearby station. Citi Field is also one stop away or a short walk. A new regal movie theater is a twominute walk away. Area is under major renovation block by block, with new restaurants and new buildings popping up everywhere. A Raising Cane chicken place just opened this weekend.

There is a very convenient breakfast. Served, with coffee, eggs and sausage, Asian favorites, baked goods, fruit juice, etc

I highly recommend this location. Nice affordable place to stay. Relatively access to the 7 train which will get you to Citi Field, easy transfer  to LaGuardia, and eventually on to Manhattan. Staff was friendly and welcoming. Nice complimentary breakfast. Property is nestled within China town and is very vibrant and interesting.   No frills , safe place to stay at a reasonable rate.","Monday: Open 24 hours

HI New York City Hostel,"891 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10025, USA",4.4,40.7986629,-73.966588,"First time staying here and really enjoyed it! The staff are all incredibly helpful and patient despite the chaos of managing so many customers, and the building itself is well laid out and easy to navigate. FYI the floors have refillable water bottle stationskeep that in mind and save some !

The rooms are standard dorms, and the beds are super comfortable for what they are. I'm grateful the rooms have AC, but the only downside to rooming with several others is that they don't always want it on when you do. Our room definitely got hot at night, and most of my bunk mates were opposed to running it. Having clip on fans in the bunks, or even to rent, would be extremely beneficialjust an idea for management. 

I also absolutely adored the location. Extremely close to the 1 line and the neighborhood itself is close to Central Park and felt very safe. I was coming back to the hostel extremely late in the evening by myself and never felt like I was in any danger.

In short, people just need to know what to expect when they go into it. It's shared rooms and bathrooms, which means there will sometimes be a wait for showers and occasionally cranky roommates. But for me, that's just part of the experience, and I would happily come back and stay again. I'll be recommending it to friends! Great hostel experience. Super busy with people from all over the world. I stayed in a female 6 bed and all of my mates were respectful. Ample bathrooms and lots of common space. The cafe inside was a nice touch. Would stay again! Great location, secure facility. Liked that I could pay 5 to secure my bag in a locker upon checkout until my departure so I was able to still sight see in the city. At first the AC in my room didnt seem to be working but they rectified the situation and the temperature was adequate. good place to stay, only downside is that you can not dictate who is in your room, and that can sometimes be a bottleneck but still 5 stars for the location. bathrooms are very clean but you dont know who sits on it. in the bodega in front of the Hostel you can get cleaning supplies to clean the toilet before and after u used it. just some tips! We have had a great time. Despite some issues with the initial reservation the staff was always very friendly and gave their best to make things work for us. Imagine a selfservice kitchen in which people from around the world prepare their meals and the HI staff calmly keeps everything in order and helps guests to find their way. Amazing! Love to come back. Great budget option if visiting NYC. Located 1 street away from the 103 subway station so it's easy to get into downtownmidtown within around 20 minutes or so depending on the train.

The hostel itself was clean, comfortable and above all else, felt very safe inside. Entry is only available to guests who are staying there, there is a filly equipped kitchen area with multiple cooking points, a theatre room, lounge, courtyard with seating, onsite cafe and games room. Each floor has multiple well maintained WCshower rooms that were spotlessly clean on each visit.

If I am in the area again, I will definitely stay here for it's location and quality of accommodation. The neighbourhood it's located in can be noisyslightly questionable at night but I have found this with most areas of Manhattan and safety in general was never really a concern. There are multiple takeaways and eatin restaurants within a few minutes walk, and for a quick bite there is a 24h McDonald's around the corner in case you arrive here at 3am.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Chelsea International Hostel,"251 W 20th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",3.5,40.7431999,-73.9989667,"I don't know what some of the negative reviews are about. I found the staff lovely, it was clean, in a great location and a safe street. Some people have said the social vibe isn't great, but I engaged by going out talking to locals, buying homeless people food or giving them apples and having a chat, they are just as valuable experiences.

My only constructive feedback is that as the sinks are in the bedrooms instead of the bathroom which is great but, it would be good to put a hand sanitiser dispenser in the bathroom, and also on the progressive, to have a recycling bin and anything but plastic spoons in the kitchen. Otherwise it was great! I liked this place. Great location and affordable. If they keep the price low, Ill keep coming back here! Staff were nice. I loved the other girls in my room. Bring your own soap, padlock, and shower shoes.

I just wish the room floor and the bathroom were cleaned more. You wont find anywhere in NYC for a better price that is this centrally located in Manhattan!

Very bare bones, but if youre in NYC you shouldnt be spending much time in your room anyway.  Room was nice, window AC unit got the room cooled down during a hot summer day, bed was surprisingly comfortable. Never saw or heard anyone else my entire stay.

I absolutely plan to stay here every time I visit NYC in the future! Barebones affordable stay in ideal location.  I stayed in a private room with shared bath.

Pros affordable, clean cleaned bathrooms daily, no bugs were sighted anywhere, AC unit in room, checkin staff was pleasant and recommended a restaurant. As a single female traveler, I felt safe walking around the area at night alone. The street wasn't particularly noisy.

Cons uncomfortably warm in hallwaysbathroomsluggage locker room. Very narrow and steep stairs that are spaced unevenly would not recommend if you have ANY kind of mobility issue. AC unit was loud

Info bring your own padlock and soaptoiletries. They provide a towel. They do not have breakfast. 5 to store your luggage in a locker. They have smaller lockers in the room. The walls are thin and AC is loud so bring earplugs. Each floor has a room with a toilet and a different room with a shower. I only had to wait for the toilet on my floor once during my stay.

Overall, I loved it here because I wanted the cheapest possible place to sleep, shower, and store my stuff. If you want anything outside of these amenities, you should go elsewhere. Like, I treated this like they had no kitchen, no social area, etc. It is genuinely just a bed and a shower You get what you pay for here, which is why it's the cheapest place in lower Manhattan. But I can't hate, the front desk attendants were nice and informative. The rooms are clean enough, but the beds dip, making it a little uncomfortable to sleep in. And it's a good location, easy to get most places in the city from here.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
The Nolita Express Hostel,"220 Bowery, New York, NY 10012, USA",3.2,40.7219997,-73.9937922,"I enjoyed my stay here, the place is beyond an average hostel, its decor is pretty and the place is well maintained.  I didnt have any problems sleeping here, it can be noisy with the traffic however with the earplugs and eye masks that they provide, i slept completely fine. The showers  toilets were super clean and good. The only thing is they will only provide 1 pillow and a thin blanket, you can request more for . Good value for Manhattan, great location, very clean, seems safe, people respect quiet hours, nice lounge, girls only rooms. Very small as expected  I stayed one night which was perfect but could not imagine staying longer, very warm in the pod, and you can hear every small noise so it made it difficult to get comfortable. You also need to be very mindful of your own noise level.

Overall good experience and great value if you need to go to NYC on a budget for a night or a few. Enjoyed my stay. As expected, the rooms were very small with the bed taking up half of the pod possibly even more. Somehow managed to get a decent sleep despite the guests snoring. They have a strict policy about keeping quiet untill 9am I believe but unfortunately some people didn't follow this rule and decided to have loud phone conversations. However, one of the guests were quick to tell them to stop talking. The staff were very helpful, it was a very welcoming vibe. Would likely stay here again as it's good value. Since its a hostel your experience will depend on others.

Someone was listening to music OUT LOUD at 45 AM for 30 min with no shame and no consideration of others sleeping. We were 3 guests to knock on their door for 10 min. Fortunately I only had to spend 1 night.

Good price, good place and good location but my experience was terrible. Checkin was so confusing. I wandered for 1 hour until I was able to find my room because there was nobody at the reception, no signs, and even when I used the intercom it was bad because its in the lobby and there was a jazz group playing so I couldnt hear anything from the intercom.

Its a shame because this place has so much potential. Way more than regular hostels. But the service was terrible and my night as well. I got to hear a fantastic jazz trio at this Hostel. I was thoroughly impressed by their skill, they were playing traditional jazz in a very lively and engaging way. The two guitar players and bass player made my evening really special and brought a lot of joy to my heart. The staff was kind and respectful.

Wingate by Wyndham Long Island City,"38-70 12th St, Astoria, NY 11101, USA",4.2,40.7566749,-73.9427359,"It's a great new hotel. It's spotless, and the beds and pillows are comfortable. However, the area around it is very messy and unsafe. Make sure you get a room on the west side. The east side street view rooms are noisy.
Needs more attention to outside entrance part, a lot of garbage around.
There is a street free parking, it's possible to get a parking spot but better not to park expensive vehicles. Hotel offers a paid parking overnight.
Breakfast is good and clean dining area. After staying at other local hotels we needed a better one that worked for several groups coming into town for my daughters wedding. Breakfast on property, walkable food options, quiet spacious rooms in a safe neighborhood at a reasonable price was a must. Amy not Gina and Jose were so helpful, see below. Wingate checked all the boxes! Amy at front desk was a true professional while assisting me with a billing issue.  The hotel is roomy and very clean.  The subway is 3 blocks away and will take you to Manhattan in 10 minutes.   HOWEVER the neighborhood is NOT good.   I only walked in the dark one time with my husband.   daytime is not too bad but still be careful. To start with PROS, i would like to say that all the reception staff, breakfast boy staff and the manager of the hotel were absolutely friendly and so kind to everyone where they could easily help you in whatever you needed!
Staffwise, cleaning etc, everything was amazing  very very good!

Now, moving on to CONS
First of all, LOCATION!!!!!
The hotel on Maps seems to be in a very nice location close to NYC by train with very easy access. BUT! The horrible thing of all is the exact location of the hotel covered by thousands of Spanish language dont know exactly from where they are!!! in governmental Shelters where every single evening, there was full music, the road outside was a playground, loud voices at 121am.
No fights or something  but just all this inconvenient evening where you could feel unsafe to go out in the evening!

Second of all and last, the breakfast was exactly the same thing rotating every single day! Same frozen stuff, iced bread. Just the basics! Scrambled eggs, sausages, coffee etc Issues I had

1. Calling the front desk takes too long. Every time Ive called it rings the entire duration then connects me to an operator who eventually transfers me to the front desk.
2. The phone in my room was not connected to the internet. The Ethernet cord is literally just sitting on the floor with no Ethernet port to connect into. Seems either lazy or silly. See photos it was borderline hilarious.
3. The showers are not hot or even warm. Lukewarm would be the best way to describe it. For me a decent shower is important at any note I stay at.
4. The strength of the shower was extremely poor. Literally came out half a foot and the top area of the shower head was dribbling. Tried to capture it best I could with a photo
5. Location is very sketchy and garbage all over the street. This doesnt impact the amount of stars I give because hotel cant control it but mentioning it in case its important for future guests reading this.
6. Only 67 parking spots which fill up very quickly. No cover, not secure, and they still want 30night on top of the room cost. Wild.

The things I appreciated about the room

1. Very clean.
2. Bed is comfortable.
3. Decor is decent.

The room itself looks like 4 star quality but thats where it stops. When I finally got connected to the front desk I did ask if they had an issue with the water pressure or water heater, and they said no. I asked to be transferred to a different room and they told me they were booked. I found this hard to believe. I checked and there were rooms online to reserve the same night I called. Either the front desk person lied to me or was too lazy to check.

Overall a subpar experience given the price of the hotel. I would not recommend. Next time Id either save money and book a cheaper hotel with same or slightly worse amenities or book a similar price yet better hotel.

Update Went from 2 stars to 1 star after I called the front desk, asked if they could bring a bottle of water up to my room because my girlfriend is thirsty, and they said I could come down and buy water if I want it. They refused to even bring water to the room. Manager kept interrupting me. Outlets in the room dont work.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Latisha Luxury Place,"48 Essex St, Brooklyn, NY 11208, USA",4.9,40.683408,-73.883859,"One of the best stays I ever had! It is a black owned business that keeps everything efficient. Every part of this house was adorned masterfully from the ornate pictures, rugs, and the marble. Whenever I needed something they were just a call away. They give you your own space yet make sure that youre alright. Best in town! I loved it here! i booked the apartment 2 and got 3 rooms for my group of 6 and it worked perfect. each room felt like it was its own experience and the common area was great and comfortable for all of us to spend time together. there was also complimentary honey buns, coffee, tea, and more. full kitchen set to cook if we wanted 2 even if we didnt. also there was an aquarium.

Did not have towels so make sure you pack your own. We had a great stay, we booked the getaway room with private bathroom for 5nights. It's close to the J train. And abit farther for the C. The hosts are kind and let you do your thing. Saw them maybe twice when cleaned the other rooms.
Only issues we had was the bed frame is very sensitive and someone may have thrown away our leftovers.
Still highly recommend though. This is a beautiful place to stay in. My room was perfect for two, comfortable bed and so many pillows i loved it. Neighborhood was quite, no noise at all. Bathroom cleaned and big enough. Had everything we need for even though i had my own products. Kitchen or the common area in general was perfect, everything needed was there and so cute and accessible. If i go again to Latisha's i would definitely buy again, owners were so kind and polite and caring. Had bus stations and trains close to location too. I was very Happy with the owner of the place. Everything was clean, the bathroom, the room and it was a very  nice spacious room. Wifi included, and all the little extras. I loved the plants he had on the corner of the house by the entrance, best looking spot in the area. I highly recommend this spot, I was very happy with everything.  Very honest service, and I liked the decorations in the kitchen, the marvel table, the coffee that was available, with muffins, it was just a great experience for me.

Hotwl over booked so I was turned away at 3am by a super rude desk clerk despite reservation Room adequate. It's a hotel near the airport. Lots of traffic and busy. Location was not safe, especially at night. Dark surroundings, poorly lighted, access road narrow and full of potholes. Kitchen staff rude. Food was barely ok. Front desk personnel not responsive. Several requests for a TV remote went unanswered. Never did get one. The lady at the desk helped me with a room early in the morning when that horrible airline cancelled my flight. The front desk person was amazing and very sweet. Room was nice but dealing with someone understanding was the best part of the mess. Very accommodating We stayed at the Holiday Inn express. The first room they gave us had the door open because the lock was extended and the card wouldn't retract the bolt.

Travelodge by Wyndham Manhasset,"1177 Northern Blvd, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA",3.1,40.7912389,-73.7024375,"I wanted to like this location. However, I just can't compare standards to other hotels. Checkin was a breeze. A little noticeable smell at the front desk, parking was easy to find  plenty in the back. I just don't like the atmosphere of the rooms.
Rooms are too bland.
The first thing I did was inspect the beds for any bedbugs none which was a relief. However, I did manage to find red blood stains and a cigarrette hole on the bed sheets.  The bathroom was a little squishy, but it was okay. Housekeeping came in daily and made sure the bed and room were tidy. Other than that, only negative is that there is only one entrance when driving in. The other entrance facing building to the left is a little steep. You will scratch your car. Mr. Patel made our stay incredibly comfortable, frequently checking in to ensure everything was to our liking. The room was clean, spacious, and wellmaintained. The hotels location was ideal, allowing us to avoid most of the traffic in NYC. Overall, it was a great experience, and the staff were very nice. Very nasty rude customer service. Bald guy with glasses in front does not like his job and looks at customers with a mean look. He thinks you are stupid and he is the know it all. Unnecessary rudeness to customers that are experiencing their hotel for the first time.
You ask a question because on the Wyndham app it says you are paying in full once you book.
When you get there they want you to pay again and it is made clear that the first charge for the room is just an authorization hold, not a payment after a lot of back and forth.

Room door is left open when you check in??? I got to my room and it was wide open.

They get mad at you because their toilet does not work!

Online it says you have hot tub you do not you have to book a different room.

Bed is clean, has fridge, nice tv and hand cloths.
If you are staying one night you cannot get a fresh set of towels and hand cloths.

Shower head looks like it hasnt been cleaned in a decade. I do not have any photos but I have never experienced this at any hotel do not go. I parked my car in front of the hotel in a handicap spot with a valid handicap permit when raj came out to tell me I cant park there hotel parking only. There is no sign that states this and the lot was packed connected to each other.  I had to help my handicap wife walk to her destination.  If he was more understanding and empathetic to the situation I wouldve appreciated it. Wyndham should hire more compassionate employees Especially to the disability community. This is based on an attempt to stay on September 09, 2024. I was told they could not honor the original rate. When I inquired why, I was given a phone number 8004661589 and told, ""That is my corporate number. Just call them."" After the rate change, I was assigned room 103, but the current guest of 103 was in the lobby and wanted to change the room because of excessive noise for the past two nights. I asked for a different room since I did not want to experience the same as the previous guest, and because someone had just left the room and there was no attempt at cleaning it, I was told that if I didn't want this room, I should leave the hotel. So I did. From the interaction of the three guests and the front desk, I observed while waiting in the lobby area I would never recommend anyone staying at this Travelodge, and Wyndham should remove this hotel from your brand.
I was given another person's receipt with their information on it. They are reusing the key card sleeves, which I believe to be very unsanitary.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hilton Garden Inn Ridgefield Park,"70 Challenger Rd, Ridgefield Park, NJ 07660, USA",4.1,40.8520125,-74.0137494,"I first off want to say that my first impression of this hotel made my entire trip, solely based off the excitement and hospitality of Felix. That guy is a god send to travelers with amazing recommendations which we did everything he recommended from food to activities and we were not disappointed!

My only complaint was the water was not hot. We put in a maintenance request and they fixed it, but it only got slightly warmer which was more doable than the original cold water.

Overall our stay was amazing and we will definitely be staying here for our next trip. Huge convince with the transit bus right outside the hotel taking us right into NYC for only 5 saved us a ton of money! Nice Hotel.  The bed was comfortable and it had a 50 or larger TV while the rest of the room was on the new side and ordinary.

The service was fine.

On downside was that the breakfast wasnt free  over 8 for a continental breakfast and over 11 for a complete breakfast. Excellent hotel. Rooms and lobby are very clean and up to date. Felix is an OUTSTANDING host. This hotel felt that it was in a safe area. Nice park with a walking trail right next door. Very happy with my stay here. Very easy access to the TurnPike. Close to the George Washington Bridge. Express bus stops in front of the hotel and takes you to Manhattan in 25 minutes.

Hotel was clean and not too crowded, just the hot tub was not hot, but in July you dont really miss it

Felix at the reception was very friendly and helpful to us. Breakfast staff was rather chaotic though.

In the end I had to ask for a correction of the invoice because the hotel had charged too much for the room, so better double check the final amount. The Hilton Inn boasted a prime location, conveniently close to the hustle and bustle of New York City, which was undoubtedly a plus. The staff, without a doubt, went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable. Their friendly demeanor and helpfulness were commendable.

Unfortunately, the accommodations fell significantly short of expectations. The most glaring issue was the stained rug in the room. It was visibly dirty and gave the entire space an unclean appearance. Additionally, the presence of mold in the bathroom was a major health concern. It's disappointing that a hotel chain with the reputation of Hilton would allow such conditions in its rooms.

While the staff was exceptional, the state of the room was simply unacceptable. It's a shame that such a positive aspect was overshadowed by the cleanliness issues.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square South,"337 W 39th St, New York, NY 10018, USA",3.5,40.7561859,-73.9929037,"For the record, I have a high tolerance for dealing with inconveniences.  I don't believe in writing negative reviews every time some silly little inconvenience occurs.

However, some silly little inconvenience is not the case with this hotel.  I booked travel in advance, but stayed during a peak travel week, which costed over 500night for a standard 2bed room.  I was there for 3 nights.

The elevator was broken every single day.  More than 50 of the time I was going tofrom my room, I had to walk up and down 17 flights of stairs.  When the elevator did work, it would stop at every other 3 or so floors, even if there were no people there.  See video

The hot water was broken every single day.  Sometimes cold water worked for 15 seconds or so, enough to brush your teeth.  The toilet didn't flush all the way.  I couldn't shower for the first 2 days there, even with cold water.  Luckily, on the third day, there was enough cold water dripping that I could take a ""shower"", which took close to 30 minutes, as the water would stop dripping, then turn back on a few minutes later. The front desk promised to have it fixed multiple days in a row.  Nothing.  On the third night, I asked the front desk to have maintenance take a look so I could take a shower.  The veryhigh maintenance kid told me all I had to do was ""flush the toilet and I would have water for a few minutes"".  I'm not a plumber but also not an idiot.  And for the record, his fix did NOT work.  See video

The bathroom was disgusting  curly hairs on the toilet, dirty streaks all over the sink and mirror, and pieces of toilet paper on the floor.

The walls are paper thin.  I could hear the neighbors having ""fun"" every night, and woke up to the plumbing screaming early every morning.

And lastly, this one IS a silly inconvenience The room phone didn't work, so I couldn't call downstairs about the major issues.  I had to use my cell phone to get routed through a general customer service operator.  I laugh about this one  Icing on the cake and all.

I spoke to a manager at the end of my stay, and this person flat out refused to comp anything, and sent me away as if they couldn't care less.

In summary, spend your money elsewhere.  My expectations were low, with it being a 3star Hampton Inn, but I had no idea how terrible it would actually be.

Also, not that I expected any grand treatment, but I'm a Goldtier Hilton rewards member, which after this stay, I believe is a worthless status to hold. A nice hotel at a good location in Manhattan.
A lot of sights are in walking distance
The staff was friendly and despite the challenge of just one operational elevator there was little discomfort experienced qs they manually rode the elevator to ensure low waiting times.

The lobby and hallways were small, but the rooms were spacious enough to comfortably house the 4 of us.

The breakfast was good and had plenty of choices to please all The elevators malfunctioned twice out of ten times during my stay of my three night stay. I managed because I was within a few of the first floor rooms but if you're staying above floor ten, good to be aware of this risk. Rooms are standard for what you'd expect for New York, though the thermostats may or may not function for your room. Our experience was spotty. The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable. Very walkable as well to wherever you'd like to go, though there was garbage right in front of the building for the majority of our stay, which was very unpleasant but was easy enough to get away from.

The primary reason for my one star review is the lack of accountability the front desk has shown with their own mistakes. During check in, my payment was split between two cards a small amount on a debit card with the majority on a credit card. I was notified that this might cause an issue when checking out, as the incidentals might not deposit correctly. I let the person working the front desk know this when I checked out and she told me she would need both cards used in the payment. Instead of noting that I wanted the incidentals returned to the debit card used, she charged my debit card twice! When I realised what was happening, I explained that I had already paid when I arrived and that I needed the charges she'd just put on my debit card released. She assured me the funds on my DEBIT CARD would be returned immediately, as she was able to cancel the transaction before it went through.

Come today, I find out that not only was I not refunded, but the charges from the hotel overdrew my bank account. I called the hotel and was told that the refund would take 35 days, and they had cancelled my initial payment and replaced it with the mistaken transaction they initiated. So now I am not only out an extra 900 for the next few days, but they are not returning that money to the account they assured me they would. When I called the hotel, I was told there is nothing they can do and dismissed with a ""so sorry this happened but oh well"".

I was here for a convention with my friends. I planned how I was paying carefully because I don't have money to just throw around and have bills to pay. The fact that your mistake means I'm scrambling to cover my bills isn't covered by a ""sorry, this must be hard for you"". I can deal with a shitty stay, but this hotel put me at risk of not being able to pay my bills and then washed their hands of it. I stayed at this hotel with my family of four, and after reading the reviews beforehand, I didnt have the highest expectations. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The staff were exceptionally friendly, the rooms were good, and the breakfast exceeded our expectations. As many others have noted, the location is fantastic, making it easy to explore the area. Overall, our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. I would definitely choose to stay here again and recommend it to other families looking for a convenient and welcoming place to stay. Disappointing Stay for a Diamond Member

As a Diamond member, I expected a seamless experience, but my recent stay at this hotel was nothing short of a disaster. My family and I arrived late at night, around 1 AM, only to find that the rooms we were promised would be next to each other were, in fact, on opposite sides of an alley. With no other options available at that hour, we had no choice but to accept the situation, which was extremely inconvenient for us, especially with young children.

The issues didn't end there. Despite being a Diamond member and requesting toiletries multiple times, we found ourselves without basic amenities for our entire twonight stay. We had to make a trip to a nearby grocery store to stock up on supplies because the hotel repeatedly failed to fulfill our requests. While the staff were polite and apologized, their words were empty as no action was ever taken.

To top it all off, the breakfast was a complete disaster. The waffles served during breakfast gave my youngest child stomach ache, which significantly impacted our vacation in New York.

In summary, this stay was a major letdown. The lack of attention to detail, broken promises, and poor service were unacceptable, especially for a Diamond member. I expected much better and would caution others to think twice before booking here.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Freehand New York,"23 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.1,40.7397951,-73.9843886,"The Freehand has no right calling itself a 4 star hotel. The rooms are decorated with what looks like 20yearold dormroom furniture. There are none of the little amenities one expects from a 4star hotel no coffee maker, no little bottles of lotion, no cups for toothbrushes. Even the toilet paper is thin and rough, and the toilet leaks when flushing.

The rooms are small, as expected, but when the rooms are too small to do anything but sleep, you would think there would have been some effort to ensure that they are quiet. However quite the opposite.

The walls are very thin and you can clearly hear everything in the hallways. There has been no soundproofing done and all noise from the streets is loudly heard inside.

The hotel goes out of its way to further disrupt its guests sleep by hosting night clubs that loudly play music very late into the night  once you arrive you see nightclubs advertised as going to 4am every night during the weekend.

The front desk staff are curt and rude, and totally unwilling to help guests with any of the noise issues.

Simply put, the Freehand is a hostel fraudulently advertising itself as a 4star boutique hotel. Avoid. My partner and I spent the first week of September in NY for our 10th anniversary, and our stay was fantastic. We booked Freehand fully aware that it's an older boutique hotel  so we were not expecting shiny new rooms  but rather a place with character. We stayed in the Premium King which was a great size. The bathroom is tight, but we made it work.

Service was wonderful. At the time of booking, my partner had made a note that it was our anniversary. Staff went above and beyond, providing us with complimentary items such as wine and drink vouchers.

We spent most of our trip in Lower Manhattan and the location of this hotel made it very easy to catch a train. We visit every few years, and I would be happy to stay here again! The mini fridge was moldy looking and half the expected size... Like there was a metal panel blocking the freezersee pic

Anyone was able to walk in and go into the elevators, each elevator required a key card to to the the floors with rooms fun to deal with especially while in a rush

The sofa seating in the room was stained and looked gross

There was no ironing board or iron in the room.

You can hear doors open and close while in a room, talking as well from the hallway

The hallway is creepy. It's dim and the floors are black total horror movie setting

Will not return Honestly this hotel really blows which is sad because the staff is so amazing!! The rooms are just very college dorm and DARK. If youre a girl who wears makeup pack a lamp before staying here and youll be fine. The staff tries their best to make things OK but its due time for a BIG renovation. The rooms are a good size for New York its just what they do with the rooms that is sad. Also this is the first hotel Ive ever stayed at that doesnt have lotion or cups to put your toothbrush in! Its budget so just level set your expectations before booking. Awesome hotel.  Our favorite when visiting NYC.  Very laid back and comfy.  The only complaint I would have is that the rooms don't have coffee makers in them.  There is a nice Cafe downstairs that has really good coffee, though.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Hilton Garden Inn New York/Staten Island,"1100 South Ave, Staten Island, NY 10314, USA",4.2,40.6148318,-74.1766456,"I worked with the Hilton Garden Inn Staten Island for my wedding this past weekend. I requested a courtesy room block and I booked a Bridal Suite and Junior Suite for my husband and I.

Working with Michelle Karlsen, the room block specialist, was a breeze. She was really helpful in helping us secure all the rooms we needed and periodically providing an updated list of guests who had booked under our block. I did at one point ask for a picture of the bridal suite so I could provide to our Photographer for reference and they told me they had no photos. I feel like if you are booking bridal suites, customers should be provided pictures. Instead, I had to go on facebook and google and go through their photos to take educated guesses on which photos were the bridal suite.

Our stay there wasn't what we were expecting. We noted our bridal suite reeked of cigarettes from the moment we walked in. We immediately notified the front desk staff, who was overwhelmed with 2 other weddings going on the same weekend, and we asked to switch our room. They had no other bridal suites available for us to switch to so we had to stick it out and accept a minimal reduction in our room rate. They offered air fresheners but i explained my goal was to get rid of the smell, not mask it. They did supply an ozone machine, but did not inform us on how to use it and we ended up realizing its harmful if used continuously and if the ozone amount becomes very concentrated in the room which it did because you cant open any windows.

They did try to correct the issue but cigarette smoke smell is something that really has no quick or easy fix and we could not downgrade to a normal room since I had my whole bridal party getting ready in that room. That was a bit disappointing and embarrassing. Every time someone new came to the room I had to warn them of the very pungent smell. Especially since the rooms were all carpeted.

The hotel itself is a bit outdated and seemed a bit understaffed on that particular weekend. For a hotel of that caliber I would have expected it to be renovated and a bit more modern. There were tons of people checking in and out so it was a bit hard to get the proper attention I needed on my wedding weekend with regards to our room.

Other than that, they were easy to work with and there were no major issues with our guests rooms or their reservations. Stayed 1 night. The ac was great. One light in the bathroom was out.  Someone shoved tissues in the tissue box, so unprofessional.   The event we had was great. The food was great.  When it came to the cake and coffee, it was terrible.  The coffee was burnt, the cake was like cardboard with ready whip inbetween each layer.  Only served milk with coffee.  Then the next day we stayed for breakfast and saw they did have flavored creamer, milk and regular cream.  So there are pros but with more cons. We had a great experience here despite it being a very busy weekend! Other people seemed to be having problems, but that was not our experience. It's important to extend grace, and most often, that's when it comes back to you. My family and I stayed in a corner room, which was good and spacious for us. I'm glad the room had a fridge and microwave as well. We needed a rollaway bed, and it gave our boys a little more room to stretch out. Ask and you shall receive. If you want to book here, I'd recommend asking about the planned events, because it seemed to be a lot of parties going on. The music didn't bother us, but if it's a concern for others, do ask. Parking is adequate as well. Lastly, we didn't make it into the pool, but the fitness center is new, improved, and spacious.

Thanks, Hilton Garden Inn. I checked in November 5th they had 2 weddings going on and understood the slow check in. Got to the room 213 and sink faucets were frozen closed could not get water other then scolding hot minimal water. Called the desk could not reach them. I waited due to many people in lobby from the wedding. Went down around 6 and they said we will call maintenance, no one showed, did the same thing on the 6th Sunday no one came. Finally around 5pm I seen a maintenance man and asked him, he said he hasnt received a work order at all but will handle it. He and partner came up to change faucet so I can brush my teeth with normal temperature water. That was issue number one. Also been calling housekeeping for refill of shampoo and soap no one showed. Went down and went to buy my own. They only clean the rooms every other day and now no airport shuttles. Years ago this place was the place to be with Friday night dancing and the hotel was awesome. Its way runned down and old, you have to see the paint job in my bathroom. Its laughable. Soory Hilton i once loved you but now we have tonsay goodbye. We're from Virginia, and this is our first trip to NYC and NJ. I've never been to NYC before, and now regrets it. The traffic there is a whole different level of nightmare game mode. After driving around for two and a half hours without finding parking, we decided to come here instead.

You will won't believe I book this Hotel via the recommended of AI Gemini.

The lobby is very nice and spacious. We booked our room through Expedia. The room is great, no pee smells or bedbugs like in NYC's hotels. Everything here is perfect after the traffic trauma, what a peaceful place.

Pros I got a double room with everything you need. There's a refrigerator, microwave, iron, tons of cabinets, plenty of daily essentials, a safe for money, and even a hairdryer. You can control the AC, which is great. They have a good restaurant here with a decent 15 morning buffet. The location is very safe, far from dangerous areas, and it's close to the Staten Island Ferry about a 15minute drive without traffic and a big mall outlet.

Cons If you're unlucky and there's a big party here when you book, you might hear the music, but it doesn't bother people like me since I'm a deep sleeper. The doors are super heavy and make a lot of noise when you open or close them.
Also, very far from NYC, at least 45 minutes driving into the NYC center, with expensive road toll.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The location is incredible  safe neighborhood, quick walk to Central Parkmuseumsrestaurantsgrocery storesshopping, and close to two subway stations with different lines 63Lexington and 59Lexington. Lia and family were very kind, communicative, and helpful. The house was exactly suited for my needs, and I loved my stay there. Also, it couldn't be decorated any cuter  the houserooms are adorable. So happy to have found this place. Would highly recommend for extended stays in NYC! Also, eat at the Tavern across the street before you leave  some of the best food I had while in NYC. Well then I have to recommend this amazing place
It was my first time in New York and I had the best three months of my life  and when you're coming to New York for the first time you want to feel safe and absolutely in this apartment I felt safe.
First of all Lia is amazing and caring and helpful and you feel that you have someone that you can talk with. and beyond that the rooms are amazing and
clean and nothing is missing. Really this place made my stay amazing.
The place looks the same as in the pictures and somehow better
I really felt like a princess and wanna come back there Perfect location. So close to the Central Park and the subway station is right at the corner. Love the brownstone neighborhood and the beautiful park avenue. And the best of all, even though it is in NYC, this place is quiet.
I stayed in the rear library suite. The room is beautiful and neat, though it is not slightly different from what the pic shown. The kitchen is small, but has everything I need. The bath room is newly renovated and looks pretty. A lot of closet space too, which is definitely a plus.
The owner, Lia, and her family are wonderful. I got a warm welcome and enjoyed conversation with them. Lia also generously agreed with my requests, which makes my stay a lot more comfortable and convenient.
Overall, highly recommend! 1871 House is such an amazing place  actually a home away from home!! Lia and Warren are the hosts you wish for in a foreign country and provide you with everything you need to feel comfortable from the moment you enter this beautiful old brownstone house. In walking distance to central park and museums as well as the famous Madison Avenue and 7th Avenue it is located in a very nice area in the UES. The Metro is just around the corner. The terrace you can enter from the Garden Room is such a lovely place to relax in New York City.
I can highly recommend staying here longterm, you will love it!!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 5:00 PM

The staff were so nice and accommodating, the room spacious especially for New York!, the bed comfortable, the shower pressure amazing, and the free breakfast in the morning was such a nice treat. They also have a wonderful rooftop deck with a great view of the city! I will probably stay here from now on every time I visit New York. The location is great too. Close to everything but tucked away enough that you dont feel like you are in the thick of it. Also the sound proofing in the rooms are great! Didnt hear anyone in the other rooms and barely any street noise. The staff at this hotel could not have been nicer and more thoughtful.  My husband and I were travelling with his brother for a family event and they upgraded us from a regular room to an unbelievable 2 bedroom suite that had an amazing terrace. It was so unexpected and so incredibly kind. The suite was so well outfitted, with everything you could possibly need. Highly, highly recommend this hotel. Hotel Scherman is now in my top 5 favorite hotels, will 100 be staying again and recommending to others! We had a very cute and very clean king room with a picturesque balcony looking down on restaurant row. Walking distance to tons of delicious restaurants and located enough off the beaten path to be within a few blocks of port authority  time square but not nearly as loud and busy felt very safe and comfortable. Staff was all very kind and knowledgable. Make sure you take advantage of their free breakfast in their solarium, it was the perfect ending to our lovely stay.  Absolutely loved staying here. The queen room we stayed in wasnt huge, but it was clean, comfortable, quiet, and the AC worked great on 90plus degree days. Minifridge in the room was a bonus too, and we also appreciated the fact that there was always a friendly face at the front desk. Oh, and the view out our third floor window was very cool and skyscrapery! But the real reason we chose it in the first place was that the location was perfect. We wouldnt hesitate to stay here again. Hotel Scherman is wonderful!  The staff were super welcoming and accommodating especially Erik  Ruth... thank you!, the hotel was beautifully appointed, the nicely decorated room was a decent size and the bed was ohsocomfortable!  The linens and towels were terrific, and everything was very clean.  We were extra pleased with how quiet it was a Thursday evening, and the lovely complimentary breakfast on the mezzanine was an added bonus.

Hyatt Place New York/Yonkers,"7000 Mall Walk, Yonkers, NY 10704, USA",4.2,40.9273149,-73.8536824,"Stayed at this hotel over the LDW. Was very optimistic as it was situated in the middle of a decent shopping mall with ton of food options nearby.

My issue for the low rating was the customer service.
My group found bed bugs in two separate rooms and the response was very sub standard.

In past experiences, the staff is very apologetic and do everything they can to make it right. The Assistant GM and GM did nothing to help the situation. We were only told they needed to follow a certain protocol and investigation. What do you mean??? Both groups that found bed bugs had young children and had to check out much earlier than anticipated. They were not offered any compensation the moment of...it was all very disappointing.
Make it right, especially if they bring the bed bug to you as proof....

The customer service was one of the worst I've experienced at any hotel and makes me question to ever stay at a Hyatt property... Great location loads of good food to eat and loads of things to do and the atmosphere was great the hotel staff was great. There was a shopping center outside good shop to buy great  clothes all your designer brands food was on point  all I can say is I'm coming back next year and if you get the chance go to honey pizza best pizza I had in a long time god bless A modern family friendly hotel.
Located among an openair modern shopping mall with lots of shops, restaurants , cafes and seating areas.

Highly recommended. Customer service was very poor. Had an issue in the GM Jason did absolutely nothing to help me out.

They charged the wrong credit card for my stay, and refused to get the right one charged. Said it was company policy. That is just absurd, I've worked in hotels and restaurants a good chunk of my life and know this is a very easy fix.

Do yourself a favor, Marriott has much better customer service and is just much nicer in general I stayed at the Hyatt Place in Yonkers for 13 week assignment and everything was wonderful. The staff is nice always greeted me with ""good morning"" after working night shift. It felt like home away from home very comfortable,  no problem sleeping via the daytime hours. My room had view of the parking lot and small kitchenette. Definitely will be returning.","Monday: Open 24 hours

We stayed there several times since it was renovated in about 2008 or so, small but convenient to times square. It was in need of renovation when we were last there in 2021. The hotels highlight is the location and price point for something in Times Square. The building is old and could use a renovation but the location and price make up for it. If you tend to whine or complain a lot, dont stay here. This place is conveniently located to literally everything including good food spots and the subway. Front desk personnel were awesome and pleasant. Theyll keep your bags for you as well if youre hitting up the airport later. Great location. Rooms are tiny, the photos are deceiving, but it was exactly what I needed  somewhere to safe sleep. The towels in the bathroom smelt like puke, which wasnt thrilling, and youll hear a lot of noise from the street, people walking through the halls, etc., but the bed was comfy. Room was way overpriced for what it is, but its also in the heart of Manhattan so I get it. If you just need a place to sleep itll do. Listen the room is small but its right next to Times Square and its the cheapest option in the area. If youre expecting a large room this isnt the place for you, go spend the extra money somewhere else. We came for the holidays and it was the cheapest option in a 10 MILE RADIUS

This is a crash pad, but its comfy and its CLEAN. The staff is pretty nice and refrigerators are available upon request we got one at checkin.

We read the reviews here and checked in around 9pm and it was smooth. The elevator is slow, but its an old building so its to be expected. The bar across the street is pretty good, and theres some amazing Japanesedim sum places nearby as well that are open late.

Some of the reviews here smh. If you expected the Hilton, go pay Hilton prices. I stayed at EconoLodge Times Square for eleven days on last december and honestly the hotel is awful. It's old and dirty. The room was cramped and barely walkable. Bed linen and bath towels were old, stained and even had rips. The toilet seat cover was broken and the shower curtain was torn. I confess that I expected more from a hotel located in a prime area and in one of the most famous tourist spots in the world. The only good points of the hotel are it's location, price and staff, who are very welcoming and helpful.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
The Iroquois New York,"49 W 44th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.5,40.7558788,-73.9819585,"This hotel was such an amazing experience. The staff was incredible especially Ben every morning at breakfast, which was also so delicious! The hotel is clean and has character. Perfectly centrally located. The rooms are a nice size and the bathrooms are great. I loved how they gave us bottled water everyday. The energy of the hotel felt like home. I will definitely be choosing this hotel anytime I stay in New York. Much better than a big hotel. We stayed here over the past weekend June 27July 1st for our 15 year wedding anniversary from Toronto. We loved this little chic, clean, quiet and classy hotel. It was minutes from Time Square and subway system, yet it wasnt noisy and even though fairly full, we didnt hear other guests. We had everything we needed and a nice greeting with upgraded room  free of charge with winecookies waiting for us in our room when we got in late from our delayed flight.

Our breakfast was included with our stay and it saved us a fortune! We had bacon  egg sandwiches everyday, chocolate croissants, fresh fruit salad, yogurt and granola. Coffee, cold brew, tea, juice etc. It was great!

Our conciergehostcustomer service manager was Ben and he was incredible! He lit the breakfast room every morning with his awesome personality and knows the city like the back of his hand. Honestly he had places to send us everyday based on the direction we were already headed in. If you dont know what to do while in the city, contact him ahead of time! He was so helpful He knows the scams to avoid and the hot spot, must dos!

Well done and thank you for a wonderful weekend away. We were there for a short time but would have loved to stay longer and will certainly recommend to others. This hotel has an unbeatable location.
Easy access to the subway and in the middle of everything.

The continental breakfast included was also really good.

Staff was friendly and kind.

Rooms were small but an average for NYC.

We would stay here again. Excellent from start to finish.  A family of four.  The service from the doormen, reception staff, breakfast staff and barman was excellent.  Room could have been bigger as not much space to store cases and clothes but for us it was completely made up for by the staff, location and relaxed feel.  Very attentive, good humoured and a lovely relaxed stay.  No waiting for the lift or queing for breakfast.  Breakfast was simple but very nice.
Might get bored of it if staying for longer than 5 nights.  Can't fault our stay. Nice sized hotel a few blocks off of Times Square. Lobby is underwhelming and small but rooms are just right and had great towels, water pressure, beds, and everyone was friendly and helpful.

The block the hotel sits on has several other hotels but the overall feel of the street was a tad sparse and dark.

Would consider staying again based on price.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The Ludlow Hotel,"180 Ludlow St, New York, NY 10002, USA",4.7,40.7218644,-73.9872093,"Hidden gem. We would absolutely stay again. Hotel feels cozy, sophisticated and trendy. Lobby bar and courtyard provide lots of seating with areas to work or relax. It was buzzing in the evenings. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Bedding and amenities were high end and well thought out. Loved the roof top deck and fitness room, with a fabulous view.  We arrived early to drop our luggage, but instead they allowed us to check in to our room hours early. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Parking directly across the street. Great location with proximity to all nearby neighborhoods. Level of service and attention to detail that lacks at a larger hotel wont be missed here. I have been staying at The Ludlow for years, ever since it opened, and it remains my goto hotel in New York City. The location is perfect for my needs, and the rooms are always impeccably clean and incredibly comfortable. However, what keeps me coming back is the extraordinary experience I have with the staff.

Everyone has been so kind and accommodating over the years. I often extend my reservations, sometimes fault for over a week and without fail, they accommodate me every single time, even going above and beyond by offering to pack up and move my luggage when I need to switch rooms if one isnt available for me at the last minute. The valet team handles everything so smoothly, and Ken at the front desk, along with all the other staff, consistently fulfills my lastminute requests with ease and warmth. I wish I had all of the other staffs names because every single one of them has contributed to my exceptional stays.

The room service is also fantastic, and the drinks at the bar are some of my favorites in the city. Its the perfect spot to meet with people, and I cant imagine staying anywhere else when Im in NYC. And I am saying this as someone who has stayed all over the city. Also its a five star hotel not four. We had the best stay of our lives at The Ludlow Hotel. We visited NYC last February to celebrate my partner's birthday. Everything was amazingthe room, the view, and the hospitality.

We had a slight wait for our room to be ready after the checkin time, but the staff kindly offered us a drink at the bar while we waited.

Thank you for making this experience unforgettable, and for the birthday champagne! I highly recommend this hotel and would love to come back ! Absolutely outstanding experience! The drinks were superb, and the hotel was incredibly comfortable. From top to bottom, the staff was exceptional, ensuring every detail was perfect. The rooms, drinks, food, and overall vibe were spot on.

I had very important business meetings with highprofile clients during my stay, and they were equally impressed. They expressed their desire to return as well, noting the hotels ambiance and exceptional service. The Ludlow Hotel has truly become a staple and a forefront in hospitality, excelling in every aspect.

Thank you for making this visit so amazing. The intriguing decor and topnotch hospitality set this hotel apart from the rest. Cheers to a fantastic place! I hope to see you all again very soon! I would have rated it higher but for the price. We upgraded to a corner room which was pleasant due to the view, bed comfort and size. Bathroom small, no turn down service. TV didn't work. Wall sconce was falling off. For 1100 night we expect better.  Service we interacted with was very nice.
Gym small. Rooftop terrace very nice.
Very noisy due to neighborhood noise on a weekend night despite being on the 13th floor.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Manhattan or the best and freest view of the Statue of  Liberty Enjoy the spectacular view. Moe has always something extra from the backery for breakfast. The house doesn't have an elevator and the ac is old fashion. Although the confortable location is worth. I called August 18th to book some dates starting 1031. The woman I spoke with stated that my reservation had been completed. I asked if I needed to do a deposit or give payment info as I was eager to book. She said it was not needed, but she recommended that I call closer to my dates just to confirm everything before I arrive. I thought this was weird but due to it being mom and pop I thought nothing of it. On September 3rd I get a call from Mo that I missed while I was at work, he left a VM stating that I was supposed to call back which was not what the woman told me and that he would cancel my reservation. Since that VM Ive called back a lot and no answer to both phone numbers. I emailed them and also no response. My friend that lives in Staten Island decided to call for me and they picked up his call and took my contact info. This bothered me so I called right after and explained what happened when I made the reservation. There was no apology. He even said my friend gave him the wrong number and that he wouldve been calling the wrong number for that reason making it seem like it was our fault when theyve had my number this entire time. I was amazed that he did not try to get this resolved immediately as it was their fault. He told me he will try to work something out but that he was too busy to today and tomorrow and will call me in a couple days. Who does business like this? I feel as though my calls, VMs and emails were getting purposefully ignored. I spoke to this man in a respectful manner but he seemed very defensive. No ownership whatsoever. I cant stay somewhere that avoids answering their phones or resolving issues. What if the day of my arrival they dont pick up? I dont get the logic and they dont seem to want my business. Be careful with this place. The reviews are misleading. I now have to look for another place to stay because I refuse to give these people my money. As someone who has worked in hospitalityhotel industry for years I was amazed by this. Didnt want to write this review but have to warn others. I stayed here for 3 nights on my way back to JFK after traveling around east coast cities. Everything at the BB is basic but meets my needs. The manager, Moe, allowed me to use their bike which brought me lots of joy. With the bike, I rode to the Staten ferry to Manhattan. Its located in a residential area next to the water, across from Manhattan. So one can see Manhattan from the house. There are quite a few restaurants and markets nearby. It looks like a quite safe area, and I parked my car on the street in front of the house for 3 days with no problem. The place is convenient if you fly inout from JFK and plan to visit NYC with no need to struggle in the traffic. I have been staying here for work for about 3 yrs. I always have a great experience! The location is great, the view magnificent, the beds are comfy, and parking never an issue. As a single woman I always feel safe. I would be remiss if I didnt mention Moe!

Pod Times Square,"400 W 42nd St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4,40.758386,-73.9930976,"This room was just about all you need. Theres no need for a big room when youre not in there except to sleep. However, the patio area was closed and it wouldve been nice to have that space to sit and relax since theres not much space in the rooms.
My only real complaints are not having a small fridge for drinks  the hotel didnt have ice. However, it is very clean, comfortable, secure and  stylish. The location is great. The staff were ALL nice, all of them from booking to check out.
Some guests have complained about the bathroom walls being frosted glass but it probably plenty enough privacy.
Id definitely stay again and may try their other hotels. Great affordable stay. Rooms are VERY small but clean. Only downside for me was the bed had a big dip on one side. Private showers with good water pressure. I was able to request a mini fridge and ironironing board. It really has just the essentials but if youre on a budget and dont need much its perfect. I travelled alone and felt safe. You cant access the room floors through the main elevator, you have to go through the upstairs lobby first and the use your keycard for the second elevator so it felt very secure. Will not hesitate to stay here again. I would absolutely recommend this hotel for any upcoming stays you may have in NYC. The rooms are a little on the smaller side, but my husband and I were very comfortable in the space. I didnt feel cramped to us. The location is unbeatable, especially for the price. Times Square and the surrounding area are filled with restaurants and activities to keep you preoccupied. There is also access to the Times Square station within a short walk that then provides access to parts of the city outside of walking distance. The bar was nice, and we had the occasion to enjoy the happy hour a couple of times during our stay. The staff was friendly. My only real complaint was that one side of the queensized bed had a dip, which was more annoying than anything. Overall, we would stay here again. super clean spot with a cool view. my friend and i stayed in a bunk bed room with a private bathroom, and it was just right since we were out and about most of the time. the free walking tours were a major win, and its super centralclose to the subway and buses. definitely recommend! only photos I have from the last day, so room is a bit messy, but dont worry housekeeping does an excellent job  Hotel was perfectly located, safe and all ya need. My mom and I really got a kick out of the bunk beds too.

Hotel Mimosa,"79 Division St, New York, NY 10002, USA",4.5,40.7141342,-73.9938025,"The staff is wonderful. Very pleasant and willing to please. The location is great, right in the heart of Chinatown. There are amazing places to eat in all directions, and the best Dumplings Ive ever had were right down the street. That being said, it definitely needs to have a deep clean. The room was clean and so were the linens. But the bathroom, in particular, the shower wasnt. Mold in the corners and up the wall. The walls of the shower had a scummy film on them and the tub doesnt look like its been properly cleaned in a very long time. Also, the drains in both the tub and the sink would pool. Leaving you standing in and inch of water by time you finished showering. However, back to the staff, they were very nice and accommodating, the manager led me to two rooms to see if the bathrooms would be sufficient for me. Although, all of them were pretty much the same, the one I ended up in was the least dingy. Still the same issues, no as bad. For the inconvenience they took 200 off my 3 night stay. Which still cost me over 600. But, like I said, the staff made up for it. Good place to stay! The service is awesome and always there for any belongings. The rooms are clean and cozy, I wished there were more cabinets or shelves to store my things in the room. It is quit despite the fact our window faced the Manhattan Bringe.
The location is great  you can easily walk to both bridges to Brooklyn, the Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. Metro is 57 minutes of walk away. Restaurants are in the next surroundings and are cheap!
I would definitely come again. This hotel is VERY, VERY small however, the service and its charm are impeccable! The rooms are incredibly tight, and the air conditioning cannot be controlled within the actual room. There is only 1 ice machine and microwave in the entire 6 floor establishment. That being said, I stayed for 1 night and enjoyed myself. The staff are exceptionally kind and hospitable. We were able to store our belonging before and after checking inout. We were also able to check in 2 hours prior to the actual check in. They brought our belongings up to the room before we even got there. The room was clean and has modern furniture. Our ceiling fan was trouble operating, but they were quick to respond. It is a perfect location, nestled on the border of LES and Chinatown. It is walking distance to the financial district, seaport, and SOHO neighborhoods. They also provide you with tons of options for food and attractions. Overall, I would recommend if you are tight on a budget but want to remain in the city or if you are staying for a quick trip. This was a great place to stay for one night in NYC. The value for the price truly cant be beat. It was very clean. On a hot 90 degree day, the temperature in the room was nice and cool I was worried about this after reading other reviews. Shower pressure was superb. Fast elevator. Comfortable bed with really nice pillows. Pretty quiet considering surrounding. Fasteasy check in and check out.

If you have more than 2 people, or a lot of luggage the room is going to be tight. If you have 2 or less people with just backpacks, this is going to be a great place to rest your head for the night!

You would be hard pressed to find a better place to stay at this price point, I would definitely stay here again! Perfect little hotel for our quick trip!

When it was 34F the thermostat wasn't working. When we complained, the engineer switched on the AC and said no heater only AC in hot mode! The bathroom size is wayyyy small and the door has a cut out to fit in the bowl.

No way this is a 4 star hotel! Walk across the street to stay at Gild Hall, we stayed there and enjoyed the place. Love this hotel.  Clean, great location.  Lots of international travelers, staff is very patient.
Please understand the location means that rooms might be smaller but its a great value.  Dont expect spacious suburban hotel rooms.  PARKING hotel gives you a discount but I advise using an app to find and reserve spots on the west side of the financial district battery park?.  Its an only a 510 minute walk and some apps make it easier to find discounts.  Street parking is possible but involves lots of luck and vigilance to move your car to comply with time restrictions. Awesome stay! Front desk was very friendly, room was clean, anything we needed they brought right away. The elevator was not as bad as the reviews say for us. We had a small wait. AWESOME location. Im glad we didnt stay in midtown. Much quieter and safer than upper Manhattan and when we did want to go to Manhattan the subway was very close and the 1 train will take you to most places. We saw the World Trade Center from our room. Would stay here again 100 Room size is comparable to NY city standards. Its small, but manageable.
Excellent location! The best part about the hotel is indeed the location.
Rooms are well designed with enough lighting and plug points.
Service is ontime.

Housekeeping staff only speak Spanish, which I found difficult because I could barely ever convey my message.
Front desk staff was a bit rude while explaining check in formalities and room assignment. Very Nice hotel. Great location. Many of the attractions are walkable from this hotel. Excellent staff! The only thing is the room was small. There were 3 of us 2 adults and a 12 year old with 2 double beds and it was tight. Although the room was small it was very clean. I sat on the floor to tinker with my suitcase and there was not a crumb in sight, not a dust ball, or hair. I would stay again.","Monday: Open 24 hours

My flight landed early in the morning and check in wasn't until 3 PM. I called the hotel to see if we could do an early check in and were accommodated once we got there. It truly was a nice experience. The staff welcomed us every time we left and came back from the hotel.
The location of the hotel is about a 15 minute walk from time square. or a 5 minute walk to the subway.
If I were to come back I'd probably stay a little closer to Times Square. Thank you for making my stay pleasant on my first trip to NYC! We are very happy with this hotel. Super clean, and very nice people. We arrived around 930am and they checked us in and gave us the room. They kept our bags until it was time to leave the airport. Full bottles of shampooconditioner, hand soap and lotion. Very good location, near LIRR and Pen Station. Wonderful stay with a great location a few blocks from New York Penn Station. The rooms were nicely renovated, but the best part was the receptionist let us check in early without an extra charge after arriving from a redeye flight because they had a room opening! Highly recommend staying here as a tourist. Some the best hotel service Ive have in a long time. Myself and a friend came for my birthday Fourth of July weekend. Even with  completely full hotel I still felt seen and heard and the service did not waiver. Accommodating , kind, they followed up on my requests to ensure I was happy. The restaurant down stairs was very nice. All I can say is Thank you thank you Ashley for making this such an enjoyable stay! If youre thinking about staying you wont regret it! Recently stayed at this hotel and apart from a little hiccup with a noisy neighbour and a conjoining room the lady at reception was kind enough to move us to another room which was way more suitable.  Reception staff were helpful and pleasant.  What made our stay excellent was the restaurant in the hotel.  Its called Burgerology.  Amazing food and great staff.  Massive thanks to Bernie he says hes just a waiter but hes way more than that great chat super helpful and so good at his job.

Courtesy, perfect cleaning, stunning position right in the middle of Midtown absolutely nothing to complain. Nothing better that this hotel, at that price, in Manhattan. Strongly recommended. Well deserved 5 stars. Absolutely enjoyed staying at this unique and trendy boutique style hotel for two full months Oct Nov during our work related trip to NY !!!!!!! Excellent location and just few minutes walk to main attractions like the Empire State Building and FlatIron, Macys at Heralds, museums, countless restaurants and movie complexes, etc. Neighborhood was safe and pleasant and rather peaceful with great ambience. Room decor was classy and warm with vintage furnishings and ample lighting. Housekeeping  maintenance teams were efficient and kept the rooms clean and well maintained.
Front Desk team members were welcoming and extremely helpful. They were always available and sincerely committed to ensuring that guests enjoyed a truly comfortable stay at this hotel. Definitely will stay here again.. Great service from the front desk. Not at all what I'm used to in modern hotels, but fine for a room by Times Square for 100. Everything is small and tight and aside from the mattress, I think most furniture, structures and the elevator are original to whenever the hotel was built. If you're looking to enjoy the hotel, this might not be your best bet. If you're looking to enjoy the city and need an affordable place to sleep and keep your stuff safe while you're out, this place is a good option. We had a great stay here and would definitely return! Its extremely affordable for midtown NYC and close to great spots and to multiple subway stations, so getting pretty much anywhere is easy. I dont visit the city to hang in my hotel room, so it doesnt have to be the fanciest place. The vintage vibe is cute and the people working there are really nice. We had a room with 2 beds and our own private bath which was really nice, and it all felt quite clean. They also have no problem at all storing your bags both before your check in and after check out. We arrived extremely early in the morning and left late at night, and we were able to store our bags for quite awhile both times with no issue. We had a really good time, every morning we had cleaned towels. When we asked for hair dryer and an iron we got them delivered to our room in less than half an hour.

We had a wonderful stay, and had a great experience with everything regarding the accomodation. The hostess is very kind and went over and beyond to make our stay amazing. We stayed at her place in Greenwich Village, NYC and it was perfect. The apartment is close to everything you could possibly need, but still far enough away from all the noise and crowds. The apartment is homey, yet stylish and has everything we could ask for. Well equipped kitchen, spacious common areas, comfortable bedrooms and nice bathrooms. Overall we had an excellent stay and would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat. We stayed in a lovely, well appointed, nicely decorated apartment in a beautiful old brownstone on 9th St while our own apartment was being renovated. It kept being delayed but Rebecca was so nice about extending our stay. She is a warm, thoughtful, considerate person who has great taste and incredible manners.  As a New Yorker, I can say with knowledge that this location cannot be beaten. It's a couple of blocks from Washington Square Park and directly between the east village and the west village with a huge choice of restaurants, coffee shops and stores. Everything downtown is walking distance. And where else do you find one bedroom apartments with souring ceilings, original fireplaces, huge windows overlooking the beautiful gardens of Greenwich Village? I can't recommend it highly enough. You won't find a more authentic NYC experience. Such a wonderful apartment!! This was the second time I stayed here and I was so happy to be back. The location is just perfect Greenwich is such a charming neighborhood and the interior design in this space makes you feel like home. Very clean, chic, cozy, and inspiring. It's an enchanting nest in a prime location of NYC and I can't wait to be back. Thank you, Rebecca for being so attentive and accommodating. Stayed in the Greenwich Village location for two months while our kitchen was renovated.  The apartment is superb  large yet cozy with 1st class finishings.  Our family of 5 with three dogs enjoyed our stay so much we are thinking of moving to the neighborhood!  The host is attentive, nice and a real doer.  Thanks so much for having us!!!!

We loved everything about your hotelthe friendly and helpful staff, the cool vibe, the great breakfast, the rooftop bar, and the clean, quiet, and comfortable room. Thank you for being there EXACTLY when we needed you and for providing the solid footing that we needed to make the rest of our NYC visit a success!!! Loved this hotel! The rooms are a little small for two so if you are staying for 2 or more days you may find this less suitable for you. They have excellent views and the staff are nice and polite. The security out front made us feel safe . Loved the decor of the lobby and check in was simple. The rooftop bar had great mojitos ! Only con is that the rooftop area closed . Ive never stayed in a hotel where they didnt allow you to access the rooftop at a certain time when you are a paying customer. Even if you wanted to go up and just sit it wasnt allowed and I was turned away. Hotel optimized the space in each room REALLY well. Everything felt color coordinated redorangemagenta pink, and carefully designed. The room is as wide as the bed was long, and the sink is in the main part of the room. Only complaint is that the lights and blinds were controlled by an iPad, which took 10 seconds to load up each time.

great views from the rooftop bar too! The service was great people are polite, helpful, kind, and friendly.

The location is good, in lower Manhattan, close to Little Italy and Chinatown, making it easy to get everywhere and near several metro lines. It's definitely not a quiet spot.

The room is super tight, modern, and wellequipped but very small.
The gym is tiny but with new and modern equipments.

Breakfast is tasty, with fruits, yogurts, and warm dishes, including several vegan options.
Amazing rooftop with a beautiful view of the city and a welcome drink included.

If it were not for the size of the room, the experience would be 10 out of 10.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Opera House Hotel,"436 E 149th St, Bronx, NY 10455, USA",4.5,40.8150867,-73.9159466,"I gave my review based on the actual hotel.

The hotel itself is lovely, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The room and bathroom were both very spacious, and the complimentary breakfast was very nice. There was also a microwave in our room, which was unexpected, but great to have.

The location is close to a subway station, so it is easy to get around, but it is a very rough neighborhood. We were never bothered by anyone while we were there, but we didn't feel very comfortable walking around as two women by ourselves. Having said that, there is a police station a couple of blocks away, so there were often officers parked in front of the building, which was comforting. But the neighbourhood still leaves a lot to be desired. This hotel was fabulous! My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary. Krystal checked us in, she was very professional and helpful. I inadvertently forgot my ID, but happened to have a picture of it. She made a call and we were checked in in less than 5 mins.

The room was large, the black out curtain were amazing and it was very quiet. The hotel was a delightful experience. The rooms were spacious and impeccably clean, with a soothing ambiance created by the soft lighting and subtle decor. The beds were incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep. The bathrooms were wellappointed, featuring modern fixtures and ample counter space.

One of the highlights of the hotel was the breakfast buffet. The selection was extensive, offering a variety of choices. The quality of the food was excellent, and the service was attentive.

The hotel's staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and valued. Krystal at the front desk was particularly outstanding. She was always smiling and eager to assist with any requests. Her professionalism and efficiency were truly impressive.

While the surrounding neighborhood wasn't particularly vibrant, the hotel itself offered a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere.

Overall, my stay at the hotel was a memorable experience. The combination of comfortable accommodations, exceptional service, and a peaceful setting made it a perfect choice. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a pleasant and enjoyable stay. The hotel was very clean and quiet. The staff were amazing and very accommodating! The breakfast options were pretty limited to pastries, cerealgranola, and yogurt. Personally that was fine for me, but that might not be for everyone. The neighborhood where the hotel is located isn't the best, so just be aware as you walk around and you'll be fine. The place was amazing! Service and amenities were great! Very fancy place and good prices!

The neighborhood is decent during the day but I wouldnt recommend walking outside late at night in the dark.

Its a great hotel. It is near a subway that can take you anywhere in the city. We will totally come back to this hotel for sure!","Monday: Open 24 hours

A bit dated, but again, for the price impossible to come close to this in Manhattan. Free coffee and continental breakfast items, interior room was quiet and dark!! Friendly staff, safe, would absolutely stay again. Excellent location right near Times Square, check in process was easy  hassle free, staff very friendly, rooms comfortable at an affordable rate. Perfect for someone not spending too much time in their room. Bed was very comfortable  shower had excellent pressure. No fridge in the room but no problem there. Coffee making facilities in room  downstairs. Breakfast was a bonus, bit of a grab  go set up, but at least something to start your day. This is an extremely old hotel and its age shows. The rooms smell, carpets are old and stained, showers need deep cleaning and replacement URGENTLY.
The staff was great and helped us, but they can no longer remedy the issues of the hotel itself.
Now, when you consider the price of over 250 USD per night, you get a pretty pity picture.
To the hotel management   It's probably the time to start investing into your property... Stay away.  The hotel has been converted to homeless shelter.  Staff are rude and have no accountability to its guests. It appears to be run by a security personnel who have no regards to hospitality or neighborhood community. Goodsized clean room for a good price for NYC. Booked thru Expedia. We visited NY mostly to see shows so the location was great. It's an older building  the elevator is small and hallways are narrow. Was quiet enough for being right off Times Square. We got a Deluxe Queen room which included a mini fridge and microwave. Air conditioning worked well. Visited in May,  but it got up to 90 deg out. Shower got nice and hot and had decent pressure. Be aware there is a very small step up in the doorway to the room and bathroom  stubbed our toes a few times! Wish there was a channel guide for the TV ABC is channel 321.  Felt safe, lobby was always attended. Overall a very good weeklong stay. Would book here again.

Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square South,"326 W 37th St, New York, NY 10018, USA",4.2,40.7544825,-73.9935985,"Our stay was comfortable. We did have to change rooms upon checkin but it was hassle free. We paid for early checkin when other hotels at times give it as a courtesy when available. But other than that it was a good stay. Don't expect a great view in all rooms. Not a problem for us as we frequent the city and have seen better views. Plus, we come for what's outside not the room views. This hotel was fabulous. I got a great rate on the room. Its conveniently located near times square but not in the madness. My room on the 10th floor was clean and quiet. Small, but had everything I needed and a nice shower, bright bathroom, blackout curtains. When I told the front desk my fridge seemed to be broken, a man came and swapped it out immediately. They also gave me a late checkout and there was flavored water available in the lobby. Front desk staff and bellman were all polite and friendly. Would definitely stay here again! My daughter and I recently stayed here for 3 nights. Everything was amazing! I could not have asked for more. The ladies at the front desk were kind and courteous. The room was exactly what I expected. The AC kept us nice and cool and the showers were hot. The room was clean. The price was also phenomenal for NYC. If I go back this is where I will be staying. Thank you Hilton hotels for an amazing stay! Awesome experience. Stayed here for a week. The location is great. Just walk to Times Square and so many other locations. Room was clean and compact. A small freeze and microwave was on the room. It may be tight for a family but perfect for couples. Checkin was smooth. There is a small shop to get everyday essential items. A nice gym also located in the basement. Two things which I did not like was, they don't provide complimentary water and also coffee was available only till 10 am. The room should have at least two water bottles. Highly recommended. Great location and Value for money. To our surprise the room was not small as expected. We had 2 large suitcases and were able to manage. The room and the bathroom were clean and couldnt find any issues. We could leave the luggage with them after checkout, as we had a late evening flight.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Four Points by Sheraton Flushing,"33-68 Farrington St, Queens, NY 11354, USA",4.1,40.7651286,-73.8321303,"The room was clean and beds were comfortable . That was the highlight of our stay. The restaurant downstairs didn't open until 5 and there's no room service. The breakfast was ridiculous. For 400 a night you still have to pay 17 per person for breakfast. We went down at 945am and everything was already empty. Instead of stocking things up like the ketchup which was just an empty bottle the women working there was standing behind the bar on her phone the whole time. She never once even looked up at us. The food was very low quality. Microwaved bacon ""breakfast pastries"" which were literally donuts cut in half and a broken toaster. Maybe they feel they can get away with this because there's no close by restaurants or anything really. This place is good for a quick trip overnight waiting for you flight but really nothing else. Yet even for the price there are other hotels just as close to the airport with better amenities. Photos are of the waitress at the bar with her head down staring at her phone and the sad look buffet table. Location is 15 min from subway.  Not much around hotel area.  Rooms are decent too good.  Clean and quiet area.  Cost of room is a bit high for location is out of the way past northern blvd. On the plus side they have a shuttle to LGA
I would only stay here if I had business in flushing.  Far from city 45 min by subway plus 15 min walk to subway. Stayed for 7 nights. Not the best decision.

Room Relatively new. Bathroom sink had a leak and the shower door didnt close. Coffee machine didnt work.

Room cleaning They kept forgetting to refill shower gel and shampoo. Had to ask twice.

Location 10 mins ride to the airport. At least an hour subway to anywhere in Manhattan and there is a 10 mins walk to the closest station. The area is safe but not the nicest. Note to myself, do not come back.....

Although the hotel itself is fine my assigned room is above averagehighest floor, lucky, clean and comfortable, the air condition is a bit off, though. Good lobby layout.

BUT, there are lots of cockroaches roaming around inside it's breakfast restaurant located at B1...... attached couple clips below. My goodness, never saw any Marriott like this before.

Finally , they got hired gun to flush its Google Map reviews, put money at wrong places...., if you ask me. Their front desk staffs seems not very happy to see customers, is another issue! My stay at this hotel was amazing. From check in to check out I was pleased. They were extremely accommodating, everything was clean and I rested so well. The rooms were big and beautiful. Kudos to the shuttle driver. He drove safely, navigated traffic well and got us to the airport in more than enough time to get our flight.

Casa Azul Hotel,"220-16 Jamaica Ave, Queens Village, NY 11428, USA",2.9,40.7188424,-73.7336769,"Absolutely horrible experience. Booked for 2 nights, I left immediately the first night. Had a sketchy lady come to my room door saying it was her room. I asked the front desk to have her removed and they proceeded to ask the sketchy lady for ID to confirm if it was her room! I proceeded to ask for a security escort to get my wife and daughter safely out of the building and was denied. I immediately called the police who were thankfully able to safely escort my family and I out of the hotelmotel. Worst experience of my life. Stay away from this place! It is incredibly sketchy and unprofessional! Worst hotel experience of my life. The lobby smells like weed, cigarettes and urine and this smell is also in the rooms. The room itself had a sticky floor, a stained toilet and stained pillows, and pubic hair in the bathtub and on the walls. They refused to speak with Expedia after MULTIPLE communication attempts for a partial refund. Sleeping in your car is a far better alternative than at this location. The worst hotel Ive ever stayed in and theres been a lot in my 60years. It was a remarkable experience the smell was disgusting, the noise terrifying, the lack of lighting was probably so the dirt wasn't obvious. It is not a luxury hotel near the airport, I slept in my clothes including my shoes in case I had to run during the night and then to top it all off the hair dryer took off the tip of my finger it had no cover on the back. I told the front desk they were unconcerned about my injury or someone else who may have a worse injury or lose their scalp. I will never fly through jfk again, flights cancelled continually, no close accommodations and taking m life in my hands was more than I could bare after flying across the pond and being up for 24 hours. Dont book it staying in the airport would have be preferable. This has got to have been THE worst hotel experience I have ever had. Once you enter the lobby, you are greeted with the comingled smells of cigarettes and weed. A smell that permeates through absolutely every part of the building, including the rooms.

The first room I was assigned was on the ground floor and had a busted window. Reluctantly, the attendant had no choice but to give me a replacement room. The replacement room wasn't much better than the original.

The bed linens were frayed in areas and had a dingy quality to them. I did not feel comfortable laying on them. For a California king bed, there were three deflated pillows. The comforters looked like they hadn't been washed, and the scent of weed in the upstairs hallway was unbearable.

At all hours of the night, there was constant noise and activity outside my room. There were people yelling, smoking, and socializing in the hallway.

I woke up the next morning dressed for an appointment and came down to the lobby to wait for my car service. Instead of saying good morning and asking how I didn't sleep, the attendant, from behind her bulletproof glass, seemed only interested in if I was checking out or not.

I spent 2 nights at this hellhole, and I couldn't wait to return to the comforts of home. The person who booked this hotel for me was so embarrassed. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. Straight trash! First of all, booked this room only because it's close to JFK Airportleaving next morning with that being said this hotel is atrocious! As soon as you walk in the front door all you smell is Marijuana smoke, I personally have nothing bad to say about marijuana but alot of other people do. The receptionist behind the bulletproof glass was nice, she checked me in quick. We walk to the room and as soon as we open the door we get hit in the face with hot air and a stench of smoke. Only one light in the room and it was so dim, the bedsheets we so filthy and had cigarette burns. The only thing that kept this from being a complete disaster was the bathroom. It actually was quite decent. If you want to leave here with your clothes smelling like smoke and some bedbugs then I suggest you stay away, you have been  WARNED ",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
The Carnegie Hotel,"160 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.6,40.7645701,-73.9800758,"Great small hotel. Very clean and neat. Room is great for one or two people. Bed was very comfortable. Location is the perfect combination. Super close to Time Square and Central Park, we did both each day easily. Such a good location we walked everywhere and didnt even need Uber. Staff is very friendly. Free coffee and drinks all day. Free wine and cheese at 5 oclock in the lobby. Loved our stay at this hotel. We stayed for 8 days and really enjoyed the room and location. The room was small but had a lot of useful places to store things and it was very nice to not have to live out of our luggage the whole time. Everything was very nice quality and we felt very comfortable in the room.

It was very nice to have the breakfast option and have free beverages and snacks in the lobby. The breakfast is pretty basic, but it was well stocked and the staff did a great job with it every day.

We felt that this hotel was a great value for the location and quality of the room. It was awesome to be so close to Central Park and have so many subway lines nearby. We were in town for my niece's performance in the Alvin Ailey Summer Intensive.  The location was perfect, just a 9 minute walk to The Ailey Studios. The staff were very friendly and professional. Specifically, Delia and Elijah were extremely helpful and accommodating when we needed to stay an additional night and in explaining the parking, which was 55for 24 hours noinout.  The hotel uses SP parking, a couple 100 ft. down the block.  Our King Superior room was cozy, comfortable and had everything we needed.  The room and hotel were CLEAN! I am big on this!!  I'm in Finance now, but worked for Marriott hotels early in my career. I could see the hotel staff take pride in their work and in being of service. Not always easy when interacting with the public. The continental breakfast was goodbagels, cereal, croissants, eggs, pastries,  waffles, yogurt, fruit, juice, hot chocolate, coffee water. Check out was at noon.  We wanted to maximize our 48 hour parking timemoney.  Elijah asked if we'd like to store our bags til 4pm.  We took in more sights, walked to Central Park, and ate at Kin Ramen, literally a few feet from the hotel.  Food was excellentloved the vibe. What a great, cleverly compact hotel. Friendly staff, newly renovated rooms that are comfortable and not flashy or over the top. Everything was clean. The complimentary breakfast is basic but good, and the snacks in the late afternoon are a nice touch. I get what other reviewers mean about the breakfast nook being cramped, but people do move in and out quickly enough that it wasnt a huge issue for us. Location is excellent  close to Central Park and the street is not too noisy. great hotel, a bit smaller than i thought but i was traveling alone so i didnt mind. the location is right by multiple subway entries so going around the city was perfect, lobby offers food and drinks 247 for no cost so if youre ever feeling up for a snack that is always available. elijah was fantastic as well, i decided to stay a extra night and he took care of it for me and also allowed me to check in early which saved my life during a hot day i really needed a shower","Monday: Open 24 hours

All the comforts of home. Very nice and professional people working there and the free breakfast is delicious, lots to choose from. My family and I are definitely going back. My wife went on a business trip last week and is a Hilton Rewards member. They wouldnt acknowledge she was a member, not sure how you can be a Hilton and not give someone there rewards. The rooms are outdated. Direct tv is the provider TVs are not smart Televisions the water in the bathroom took 27 minutes to get from cold to luke warm. After complaining to the staff for 3 straight days, they said they would send maintenance. No one ever showed. Customer service was the worst. Rude, inconsiderate and bad temperament. Do some research because after staying here, I would have choose to have a farther drive with a better hotel and staff. After checking within 10 minutes house keeping barged in no knocking no nothing and was rude telling her she needed to finish mopping, isnt that supposed to be before check in?? CARLOS and SANDY at the front desk were highly unprofessional, werent wearing any name tags, so I have to ask.
They were okay until we had a little problem with the reservation.
And its not what they did not a big deal, its how they did it and they attitude.
The attitude wasnt just cold it was mean spirited and rude.
Its shocking that such a great company employs individuals with such a terrible attitude, especially at the front. Shame. I stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in New Jersey to celebrate Independence Day today. I had reserved two rooms, but upon arrival, I found that the air conditioning in one of the rooms was not functioning. I reported this issue to the front desk immediately, but after waiting 45 hours with no resolution, I went back to the desk.

At this point, a staff member named Jamie informed me that there were no other rooms available and told me to wait another 15 minutes before checking again. She then walked away without further assistance. When I asked for a business card to file a complaint, she gave me the manager's card instead of her own and refused to provide her last name, citing Hilton's policy. Additionally, she tore up the business card she had given me.

I am appalled by this unprofessional behavior. Is this the kind of service and attitude Hilton endorses? Should I continue to patronize a place that treats its guests this way?

This felt like an act of discrimination. Should I remain silent about this? Location, curtious staff and price. I checked in and receptionist Fatima helped me out by answering all my questions.

We stayed in room Stanford White on the second floor, facing the peaceful backyard. Super comfortable bed, very spacious, lots of storage, wonderful bathroom. Two beautiful brownstones connected, lovely common area. There is a tea room which we did not test but looked fabulous. The bar was closed but also looked very promising. Ive been to NYC several times but this was by far the best experience.  Thank you TIAIP Team! This hotel is VERY different from a normal hotel. It's in a converted brownstone and only has a few rooms. My room is HUGE, easily 45 times the size of a normal Manhattan room. The decorations are classic and can look old at times, but it's a really unique effect and I like it. It's also the quietest hotel I've ever stayed in on Manhattan. I had trouble getting the wifi to work, so business travelers that can't hotspot may want to look elsewhere. I will definitely stay here again! Superchic yet Charming tea roomhotel takes you on a Magic Carpet Ride to another time and place. Opulent, ornate and very lowkey, it is definitely a reminder of a New York from yesterday. Keeping true to its culture and charm. I would definitely recommend going to have a cup of tea and cookies with your best friend or a third date. The service and ambiance here were exceptional. The building has a lot of personality and the charm of an old inn. The suite I stayed in was generously large, and it overlooked Irving Place with a lovely view. If you're a light sleeper, you'll want some ear plugs if you're staying in a room that overlooks the street, as it is an old building not built to be soundproof. The Inn at Irving Place is two old town houses converted into a 12 room hotel. I would more accurately describe it as a bed and breakfast. Outside is a nondescript building making the Inn attractive for folks such as celebrities looking for a stay in NYC. The lack of a sign was a bit confusing. Just look for the address of 56 Irving Place. I highly recommend for the charm alone. We attended a show at Irving Plaza, which is about 2 blocks from the Inn. The Union Square subway station is about five blocks from the Inn, making travel to it a cinch. We will definitely stay there again the next time we visit that part of town.

The Harlem Flophouse,"242 W 123rd St, New York, NY 10027, USA",4.7,40.8081829,-73.9509644,"When we were searching for properties for our visit to New York this month, we were so surprised to find the Harlem Flophouse, due to its uniqueness and competitive price.

It came for us to arrive and straight away we knew we made the right choice. The interior was so unique and inspiring, that you felt you were being transported back to the past. The checking in process was simple and when we arrived to our room, Rene had made a hand written sign with my wife's name on it and when we entered the room, the radio was playing with jazz, that fitted perfectly.

The room was fantastic and the facilities were just what we needed for our stay and despite people having concerns about sharing a bathroom with other guests, there were no issues at all for us.

We even had the privilege of meeting Rene's cat who welcomed us home after a night out, who was very friendly and even showed us to our room too.

When we were leaving, we met Rene, who was as friendly and inviting as the property.

Overall, The Harlem Flophouse is a cool jewel set in New York and we will definitely be back and I encourage others to go there for the experience.

Brian  Iwona It was a 1010 for me. Such a gem in the heart of Harlem. The interior was so curated and brought us back in time. The jazz radio, I think was the highlight for me and Im planning to get a similar one for my flat in London. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding of such a high quality. I read some reviews where people were complaining about the smell. I can safely say they did not smell bad, simply do not have those strong conditioner smell. They actually smelled of home. It was a little bit far from central Manhattan, but we did not mind it too much as my husband clearly requested a stay in Harlem to soak in the black culture history. Although we had to share the toilet with other rooms, I did not see that as a problem and loved how the owner was collecting left toiletries and sharing them with future guests, instead of throwing them away! I forgot my toothbrush so that came quite handy. For the price you pay in New York, we were lucky enough to get a room at the Harlem Flophouse. Thank you Rene My partner and I stayed at the Harlem Flophouse for 4 nights in the Cozy Cole Room. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay from the moment we arrived. The staff are very friendly as is Ren. The Flophouse has a great vibe and it was a great place to return to after exploring the sights of NYC. The room was very quiet, the bed very comfortable and the shared bathrooms were always available when we needed them. There are plenty of express trains to get to the center of Manhattan. Thank you Ren and your very helpful staff. We will definitely return. What an absolutely charming hidden gem! I was fortunate to score some tickets to the Tuesday is Bluesday event at the Flophouse, on our local Buy Nothing Group with thanks to owner  musician Rene. While at the venue I was invited to peak upstairs and see one of the rooms, which is delightfully decorated and huge, particularly for NYC standards. The bathroom is a place you want to get lost in and I love the clawfoot tub. The details all throughout the house are curated to the highest aesthetic, elegant and thoughtful.

The music was awesome  amazing, original music by Rene in collaboration with his band members, each a fantastic musician. Don't miss one of these nights! It's a rare, truly Harlem experience. I left with a handful of new friends and a load of inspiration!

Thank you Rene! It might just have been my favourite hotel ever. I loved the room decoration and attention to detail. Great quality of bedding and towels, even such details as trash cans are aesthetic. Lovely bathrooms too, and even though they are shared with other guests I never had to wait when I needed one. Some comments complain about the smell of the bedding, for me it was a first hotel during my stay in US where the rooms did not stink of strong chemicals. I use green  biodegradable washing agents myself so that was a pleasant surprise. It just felt like home away from home. It was a pleasure to come back to our room each night. Overall just great vibe of the place! I liked the location in Harlem, Apollo Theater nearby is worth a visit, there are also some coctail bars around. We walked back home around midnight a few times with no problema. And you can get to more central Manhattan quite quickly with the express subway line.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM

Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown,"27 Barclay St, New York, NY 10007, USA",4.7,40.7126317,-74.0091904,"We just got back from a 2 week stay at this hotel. The location is great as we prefer to be that side of townnear to Soho etc. however, I did find for a Four Seasons property the service was really lacking and there was no attention to detail. The valetbell men seem more interested in trying to look and act cool than actually focusing and doing their job. Any time we asked for anything they made us feel like they were bothered by it. For the first 4 days the same guy asked us each day if we were checking in? Even though he had taken our bags when we arrived the first night. Any other Four Seasons we stay at you are welcomed and greeted by name.

We had 2 family birthdays while staying there and while we didnt want anything from them, there was no recognition of either which I found disappointing considering one was for our 3 year old. For the second one, my husband asked reception to inform the restaurant but when we were dining the restaurant said they didnt know about it and then sent us out a happy birthday message with the wrong name on it.
We did have some other small issues with housekeeping  inroom dining too. As I said, no attention to detail and as a family who frequently stays in Four Seasons properties around the world, this one is definitely not up to the standard of others.

On a side note, the 2 concierge ladies were nice, friendly and helpful and we did have a lovely server in CUT restaurant.
Would return for the location but definitely needs some improvements. My 5 Star review is due to the wonderful staff here at the four seasons NYC. Pablo took care of any issues that arose for me on our recent 4 to 5 day stay, also he made sure we had all the little extra touches I requested. The basic king room was great with a huge tub, TV in the bathroom mirror and a nice downtown view! The hotel provided a nice touch with the car service that takes you around downtownalthough I think it should have hours until at least 11pm or 12am as it ends now at 8pm, way too early for NYC...The Doorman Daron, and the Drivers Tony and Richard ensured that we knew where we were going and had a great time!! Peter also went out of his way to make sure my mother, who is disabled had everything she needed! We thank the housekeeping and concierge and the in room dining  which is one of the best I've had as well for making our trip special!! The Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown is one of my favorite hotels, even though the location isnt ideal for me personally as I'm usually in the city for business in other parts of town. Despite this, I consistently return to this hotel because it is exceptional.

When spending at this level, hotels generally share highquality materials, comfortable beds, and good food. What truly sets a hotel apart, and why I keep coming back to the Four Seasons Downtown, is the exceptional service. This hotel goes above and beyond to ensure that your stay, both now and in the future, exceeds your expectations.

The attention to minor details is where the Four Seasons excels. For example, there is always a doorman present to open the door for you. The service at the Four Seasons is unparalleled you are always greeted warmly, with everyone smiling and making you feel truly welcome. This level of attentiveness and care is what makes this hotel stand out.

I've stayed at the Ritz in New York City, which is an exceptional hotel as well, but the service does not live up to the standards of the Four Seasons. The consistent presence of a doorman, the genuine smiles, and the welcoming atmosphere are just a few examples of why I love the Four Seasons.

If you are looking for a hotel that prioritizes exceptional service and attention to detail, the Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown is the perfect choice. Despite its lessthanideal location for my business needs, the outstanding service and hospitality make it worth every visit. Definitely one of the best places in NY to stay, in the convenient financial district, the rooms are bigger than most, the hotel is maintained to the highest level, the staff are amazing and the barrestaurant is awesome. Always celebrities or sports stars here. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough, like all Four Seasons properties, it's simply perfect. The hotel is very clean, quite and modern. I loved staying in it for two nights. However, the location is a bit far from mid town who is seeking for boutiques and shopping. One more note to add, I have done early check out this morning at 1048 am and the guy in the reception was very rude! This receptionist needs immediate training courses on communication and respect!",no operation time,"spa, lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
TRYP by Wyndham Newark Downtown,"24 E Park St, Newark, NJ 07102, USA",4,40.7383178,-74.1679982,"Great location. We are visiting from out of town without a car, visiting NYC. The hotel is right next to the train to New York and the transportation is easy to understand. The hotel is clean, modern, tidy and quiet. Beautiful interior. We paid for the breakfast everyday of our stay because we thought it was worth the money. We would absolutely stay here again if we came back to the area, and we will recommend staying at this hotel to others. Decent hotel. I liked the rooms and how toiletries and other items like water bottles were included. One one of the days I was there out of the entire week we stayed, my room smelt of heavy smoke. However, the next day the smell went away. Would've preferred if breakfast was included given the cost and length of stay. The airport shuttle was useful but it would be great if we had a number we could call to get ahold of the person. Luckily the hotel is located close to Newark Penn Station. Would've preferred if it was in a less sketchy part of town. Honestly the hotel was fine. The rooms were clean. Stayed there twice.... The latest stay was on the 2123 of August. Accidentally left an expensive steamer that is not Dyson but looks like one... I was in town all day still but the hotel failed to contact me to let me know I'd forgotten it. I could have picked it up as I left my car at their parking lot until 8 pm. Just discovered it's not in my luggage when I got home. I was planning to stay here in the future but I guess a 100 dollar steamer is worth more to them than a recurring customer. If you are staying here for ""ease beforeafter a flight""  DON'T!!! I waited for 2.5 hrs at the Newark airport parking lot for a hotel shuttle that NEVER CAME, even though I had emailed days ahead of time to confirm where it comes and the times, as well as calling the reception TWICE while waiting in the parking lot, and they said it was on its way it wasn't. Eventually, at midnight as a solo female traveller, I took a 50 cab for a 10 minute drive.

When I shared this with reception, all they said was that ""the shuttle is a courtesy service so I should just be glad they offer it."" I'd be glad if it actually came. Since sharing the situation and simply asking for reimbursement of the cab, there has been no contact or response from their originally very responsive team.

Further, the next morning with different staff, I asked about the shuttle to the train and they were not very friendly  it felt as if I was a nuisance to their day. I do not recommend this hotel and will never stay here again. It was a nice hotel... in a cool place.. I was there for an event. There literally was no parking!!! What.......!! I had to park like 56 blocks away... but overall, the environment is neat. I like the fact that the bathroom is spacious and top notch","Monday: Open 24 hours

The One Boutique Hotel,"137-72 Northern Blvd, Flushing, NY 11354, USA",3.5,40.7635042,-73.828416,"Good location, 10min walk from the subway station. Right next to a police station. Very affordable. But the room design and cleanliness have a lot of room for improvement. I found a cockroach in my room. The room has an unpleasant smell. And in the way they design the bathroom, there is no way you can shower without flooding around your bed. Tldr  Do NOT stay here!

This place is basically falling apart. We ordered a balcony room and the balcony was being renovated with all the flooring ripped out with a sign that said do not enter the balcony. We got this room specifically because of the balcony. We asked for another room and at first they told us no and to just use the balcony as it! We told them that was unsafe and unstable as it had NO FLOOR! They then decided to give us a new room after showing them what it looked like. The new room had a good balcony.

Then I simply wanted to use the iron but it leaked water all over my phone and table. I had to get another iron from them to which they gave us one that was beyond filthy and dirty. Had to ask for a towel to clean the extremely dirty handle of the iron.

The shower leaks all over the floor and these 3 issues all happened within the first hour of us showing up 3 hours after checkin which means they had all the time to get these rooms in order.

The next day the hot water stopped working. There was a leak above with water coming through the lights in the hallway. The leakflood broke the elevator and the smoke detector wouldnt stop beeping for hours.

We now have no hot water, a room where the moister and steam from the shower never truly leaves the room, and a front desk person who claims the hot water heater isnt broken 

Its in Flushing Chinatown so plenty of great things around but overall if youre cool with a low end hotel and youll mostly be out and about exploring NY, you should be fine. But otherwise

Do NOT stay here! If I could rate zero stars, I would.
I reserved a Double queen bedroom with days of anticipation and the check in day, they change us the bedroom for two full size bedrooms.
One of the bedroom was the worst I ever met in my life, the worst experience. A lot of filthy inside, the bathroom has no shower, no AC, no windows, it was like a cage and so warm inside. They only provide us an old noisy fan. We couldnt rest. As well, we found big roaches inside the bathroom. Definetely, dont stay here. The worst hotel ever!!!! After looking at multiple reviews of this hotel me and my girlfriend decided to still give it a shot as the hotel was close to the US Open. We stayed in a bigger room grand suite the room has a lot of shelf and storage space which was nice.
The bed is super comfortable. The TV is not good. Not HD and none of the streaming apps were updated which you can't update yourself for some reason. Only 3 channels in English. Everything seems a little bit dirty or breaking but I've stayed in worse so that's fine with me.
We did hang a do not disturb sign on our door while we left for a day because we did not want anyone in our room but the cleaners still went in and made the beds. Nothing was stolen and it was nice to have fresh towels and bed made but for future reference lock stuff away in the lock box just in case you decide to leave for the day.
The surrounding area is Flushing Chinatown so there is a lot of great cuisine and culture which I liked. It is next to a police station so it does feel safe.
The shower is open to the entire room so only stay here if you are okay with doing that in front of the person you are staying with. Judging by other reviews it seems all of the rooms are like this.
The rooftop bar had amazing views. The drinks were okay. They give you a menu of drinks and food and if you don't want what's on the menu the bartender seems to not like it. It got to the point where the bartender decided to not even make me an old fashioned, she just poured a cup full of straight whisky. The music is also blaring which I found a little annoying as there was only a few people up there just trying to have conversation.
Overall, I've stayed at better and I've stayed at worse. I would not stay in this hotel if it wasn't so close to the US Open grounds. I would not recommend staying longer than one night. It does the job but there is better if you want to stay in New York or Queens specifically. This hotel is going downhill. One can see that, at one point, it was a quality hotel based on the decor. Unfortunately, it is now falling apart. My first few stays were nice but gradually, I started experiencing the downfalls. My latest stay, I upgraded to a room with a spa bath. However, the worn carpet in front of the bed was not vacuumed. The seal to the shower does not repel water as it seeped all over the floor. The window curtain, to the bathroom, was covered in mold. Lastly, I found hairs in the chipped up bath tub. Renovations and good housekeeping are seriously needed.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Fairfield Inn & Suites New York Staten Island,"290 Wild Ave, Staten Island, NY 10314, USA",3.9,40.5868991,-74.1911844,"1010 or A. The room was cleaned thoroughly.  Including the Ice bucket, the freezer was defrosted and cleaned I had neighbors and I couldn't hear them. The breakfast was amazing. Buffet style bacon, turkey sausage, pearl button waffles, breakfast sandwiches, toast, muffins. The list is long. There is something for everyone including fresh fruit  yogurt. Anthony is the gentleman that runs the breakfast. He is a really nice person and I hope that your company values him!  The front desk crew was more than helpful. The restaurant is open on the weekends. Next to the front desk they do have some frozen options. They also have security. The location for me was perfect. I don't have anything other than positive things to say. Tight but nice looking. Lots of construction, big garbage bags full and open as soon as we opened the elevator when we came in, were still there when we left for an event and still there when we came back after midnight. Upon check in the desk person was on a call and we waited and after, without even acknowledging we were there, went on a second call. Another staff member came to assist her with something, also ignoring that we were there. Room was nice but had no hot water, we reported it and they didn't have a person available to fix it. Room smelled slightly like cigarette smoke. We had no parking on site when coming from event late at night, and the street was isolated. I had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. The room was good, quiet, and comfortable, which made for a relaxing experience. The breakfast was excellent, offering a great start to the day. Additionally, I appreciated the convenient checkout time of 12 PM. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for a comfortable stay. I've stayed at Marriotts across the country because they are reliably clean. This one was disgusting. Sticky floors and bugs in the bathroom. Every time the AC turned on it the room filled with a sewage smell. I was so happy we were only there for one night. If you are not working at the Staten Island business park then there's probably no reason to stay here. It's a nice place but pretty remote from everything else. Very few restaurants or anything else close by and nothing in walking distance. Getting into the city from here takes a while.
Parking here can be a little bit tough. I ended up parking on the street one night. The people were nice The food was okay and the room was pretty good though a little dated. The only complaint I really had is that my TV would not shut off. If you hit the power button it would go into a sleep mode where the screen was still lit up. I ended up covering it with a towel so I could sleep.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Fairfield Inn & Suites North Bergen,"1707 69th St, North Bergen, NJ 07047, USA",4.4,40.7996544,-74.0222159,"This was our second time staying at Fairfield Inn  Suites in the last year. We are new cruisers  utilized their Cruise Package that allows us to stay the night before departure, provides a shuttle to and from the cruise terminal  allows us to park our car at the hotel for up to 10 days. Weve had two WONDERFUL experiences with this package.

Everything regarding the cruise package is ran like a well oiled machine down to the shuttle drivers. I love how organized they were which provided me with a lot of peace of mind. The shuttles drivers really know how to navigate NYC traffic  I appreciate them for doing so because I absolutely could not!

The hotel is clean  the staff is incredibly friendly. Our room was perfect  we even had a view! Its in a pretty great location aside from there being a ton of one way streets which makes it a little hard to navigate when driving.

We will absolutely be staying here every time we cruise which will be very often if I have my way. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone cruising out of the Manhattan terminal. We had a fantastic overnight stay and then we used their parking package to leave our vehicle at the hotel and shuttle to the Manhattan Cruise Port for our cruise. The staff were super friendly, our vehicle was locked up tight in their secure garage and the shuttles worked perfectly. The hotel was very clean and the breakfast was good. Would 100 recommend if cruising out of Manhattan. Even though hotel has some kind of funky smelling, the breakfast service was great with very wellseasoned eggs and bacon. Also comes with chocolate milk and yogurts. Staffs even refill slightly after 930 ending time for late comers. Soap was great and shower is has been nicely refurbished. Overall, great hotel and stuff, but room carpet should be updated. This is the 2nd time we have stayed at this property. Everything was wonderful. The staff has always gone above and beyond to provide 1st quality customer service. Gianna and Tyler were fabulous. My family will not stay anywhere else when we are in the area or traveling on a cruise out of NY. The rooms are clean and quiet and the free breakfast is a bonus. This is a long over due review, but I copied and pasted what I sent to my insurance company this past winter. I DO NOT recommend staying here if you need to use their shuttle service.

I stayed at the Fairfield Inn and Suites for one night and paid for a package including parking for my car for the duration of my trip, and a shuttle to and from the cruise port terminal. I had a guaranteed reservation for myself and two others in my party to be picked up from the cruise terminal at 945AM. We arrived to the pickup location given which was Pier 90 spot  29 at 930AM. 945AM came and went and no shuttle had arrived.. at 10AM we called the hotel as did many others waiting to be picked up by this shuttle. we were told the shuttle was 1015 minutes out. We kept waiting and many more phone calls were placed. We were all told different times and that the shuttle was on its way. The shuttle didn't arrive until almost 11AM. We waited outside in the cold for over an hour in a half along with other families waiting for the shuttle. We paid for this service and for a reserved time at 945AM. This also caused us to be much later getting home and had to cancel work appointments because we did not arrive home at the expected time due to an extremely late shuttle. There was no apology from the hotel even with several families complaining and services not being met. I feel that since we paid for 3 people to receive shuttle services, and services at 945AM and services were not met, we should be entitled to a partial refund but the hotel refused. The wait was ridiculous and hotel staff was very unaccommodating well we had no choice but to stand outside in the cold for an hour in a half.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
The Local NY,"13-02 44th Ave, Long Island City, NY 11101, USA",4.4,40.749595,-73.947825,"The Local NY is quite a chill, hip place to refresh and restore. It includes a fully established cafe and bar, very tasty pastries, and bar snacks available. They also have a kitchen equipped the basics, so the option to cook is there. Dorm rooms are simple, with a toilet, shower, and sink. The lighting is warm, which makes it more welcoming and homey. Will definitely recommend and return if I make another trip to the States. I loooveeeeddd the hostel! Lived here an entire week and had zero complaints. The staff was very very nice and chill. You could ask them about anything and theyll have an answer or at least try to help you out. The bar, and rooftop are immensely pretty. Location felt pretty safe walking to at 11pmmidnight alone as a woman. The rooms are decently sized, people visiting are pretty cool too and keep sound levels pretty low. I am a light sleeper and was worried I wouldnt get a decent night of sleep at the hostel, but was quickly proven wrong! Ill go again. Keep up the great work guys!  Was a little hesitant at first since I've never stayed at a Hostel. But I fell in love with this place after my first night there. My roommates and the other people I met here were awesome. They have really cool amenities in the bottom floor. I would definitely recommend to all solo travellers Amazing stay here, the hostel is well located in the Queens really close to Manhattan. It is freshly new with a bar, games, kitchen etc. You also have a rooftop with a view on Skyline on the 3rd floor. I highly recommend ! I am 1000 coming back, I had so much fun, the staff were so welcoming! Everyone I shared a room with was super respectful and I ended up seeing a side of the city that I never expected to  Justin at the front desk helped me out more than a few times and is an all around great guy, plus the bartenders are super fun and great people to ask if you want cool suggestions about where to go.

138 Bowery,"138 Bowery, New York, NY 10013, USA",4,40.7191366,-73.9947673,"Expensive prices per night.  Night clubs in the area, homeless people encountered every now and then. Overall, it's an ok place to stay for few days if planning to visit Manhattan, NY. Really nice, new hotel with a fresh independent feel. Location is great for little Italy and loads of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Only improvement would be better curtains on the windows, but the bed was really comfortable and TV with Amazon prime was cool. excellent place to stay good location. The place is expensive and for the price they should have cleaning supplies, kitchen cloths, etc.! must include basic services. Very expensive hotel. Even more so when we showed up and told us theres be an additional daily fee just over 20 for cleaning the room. Of the 4 nights we stayed, everyday our bed was made but the towels were never changed out so that made it feel like a rip off.
The room was nicely done up though but wouldve been nice to have more things in the mini kitchen ie some bowls or cutlery, a kettle or toaster.
The place was close to everything and it never took us more than 20 min on the subway or busses to get anywhere we were going. What a fantastic location, and the whole stay from checkin to service and facilities were soooo good! All construction had finished. The room was amazing with so much space, free gifts to try including personal care products  all at such a great price for the stay.

Walker Hotel Tribeca,"77 Walker St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.1,40.7184171,-74.0022849,"There were a few surprises with this hotel, both good and bad. First, theres a hidden facility fee that wasnt clear when I bookedits calculated daily and is quite a high percentage, so the final price is not what you initially see.

The rooms are small, which is typical in NYC, but even so, I was surprised by Walker Hotels layout. The interior design isnt very functional, with a large single sofa taking up a lot of space. The sofa isnt particularly comfortable either, and moving it is a hasslethe heavy backrest can easily pinch your fingers. I had a painful experience with it, and what really touched me was my 1.5yearold trying to scold the sofa for hurting me! My heart melted, but be cautious and dont let kids play around with itits very easy to get injured. The room is so tiny that even turning around is difficult.

Ultimately, youll probably just stay on the bed, which isnt a problem if all you need is a place to sleep. After all, the hotels location is excellentperfect for exploring NYC, not staying in the room.

The hotel isnt very strollerfriendly either. The checkin desk is on the basement level, and from the first floor, you have to take the stairs up with your luggage and stroller before heading downstairs again to check in. Theres a man at the entrance wearing a flashy outfit, but all he does is point you to the stairs and then downstairshe wont actually help you with your bags. Its just how some New Yorkers are indifferent and cool.

On the bright side, the coffee shop on the first floor is quite nice, and I had a pleasant experience there.

Overall, while the staff could be more helpful and the rooms are not the most practical, the location and the caf downstairs do add some redeeming qualities. Just be prepared for a bit of inconvenience if youre traveling with kids or have a lot of luggage. Location was fine and the room was clean. Service at the front desk was extraordinarily, aboveandbeyond helpful, with everything from AC to checkin. However, the rooms are so small that they're barely habitablethe bed was so small that my husband and I didn't fit together on it, and my legs stuck out over the edge. There was no place to charge our phones. It was a really depressing evening overall. I could not have asked for a better experience at this hotel! From the moment we walked in, the staff was friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a king suite and received free drink vouchers. While we were only staying one night, we got to check out the rooftop bar with amazing views, drinks, and food. The staff there was incredible as well. I could not believe how nice of a hotel this was for the price. The room was perfect for two people and very clean. I will not stay anywhere else when I return to NYC! I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in this area. Great location and staff are very helpful. The room was mostly clean but some corners had dust buildup andor werent wiped properly. Some parts of the room a bit tired and in need of TLC. Rooms are very small  but thats manhattan for you. Overall would recommend for a place to sleep and a nice vibe from the hotel if you dont need much else! My husband and I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Manhattan and wouldnt return here. The location is great and the Blue Bottle in the lobby was lovely to have. Check in was a mess, service throughout our stay was not great, and room keys worked only intermittently. We stayed in one of the larger king rooms and it was still the smallest NYC room Ive ever stayed in, almost comically so. Its not a bad hotel but for the price you can do much better, even in Manhattan.","Monday: Open 24 hours

We were also within walking distance of the World Trade Center, Brooklyn Bridge, and Wall Street. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a fantastic experience and would definitely recommend this hotel to others. Reading the reviews Im shocked by people complaining about room size. We booked the king room with terrace and it was bigger than I couldve ever imagined a NYC hotel room to be! Bed is super comfortable, shower is great, staff is SUPER friendly and helpful!! I love the lighting on the mirror in the bathroom too. Even the closet fit my suitcase and all my unpacked belongings and there was a safe! This hotel is walkable to so many areas. I cannot wait to come back and try the rooftop as well. We stayed here at the start of our honeymoon. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Lovely room with very comfy bed and fabulous views! Very accessible for the subway. Wed certainly stay here again when visiting NYC. The hotel's location is excellent, with attractions like the World Trade Center, Battery Park, and the Brooklyn Bridge within walking distance. While the rooms are compact, they are adequate for a comfortable stay. A highlight is the trendy rooftop bar offering signature cocktails and small bites. However, the standout feature of this hotel is its exceptional staff, who provide excellent service. I highly recommend it! The reviews dont lie.

Car park is free and doors opening with room key. Valet avaliable for free but I parked myself..
If you are sensitive about sound ask for a back looking room because front road is very noisy.
Thank you Pros Staff were welcoming and very friendly. Checkin was quick and easy. It was about 10 minutes from American Dream which is where me and my family spent the day making this hotel convenient. Room was clean and it was quiet.

Cons Wish the breakfast buffet had more options, it was very limited. I booked through a 3rd party website and booked a one bedroom suite paying more for that option, but at the hotel I was put in a studio. Not a big deal if I didn't have to pay more, but I did. I would still definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again. One of the better Hampton Inns Ive ever stayed at. Very clean, highly professional staff. Superb!  Kim at the front desk is excellent, very helpful  attentive. A credit to your hotel overall. Spacious and clean rooms, free parking, and a location not far from the city are the most important pros of this hotel. They could do a little better on services like empty shower gel almost on arrival and no one to bring a bar of soap to the room at night. One other thing that bothered me was the parking valet service, that is absolutely unnecessary. On arrival they pretended that you have to use their services since the parking is full that turned out to be not true. Just get your key cards and you can get in and out of multilevel parking with convenient elevators right to your floor. We always have a wonderful time at this hotel, it is close but not too close to NYC.  Kim at the front desk is warm and helpful, she is a real joy to be welcomed by.

Our toilet broke and they did not move us to another room  we had no toilet for hours. Cannot recommend. Go to the Ritz! Was celebrating my daughters birthday and specifically asked for a wonderful experience and it was one of the worst. Exceptional hotel. Stayed here for three nights recently. I stayed in room 2603. My only complaint was you could hear the elevator noise fairly clearly. Room is huge. Has amazing views. Service is exceptional. Breakfast and the 4th floor lounge was amazing. Location is great. One of the best hotel experiences I have ever had in NYC. Love this hotel. While the rooms are lovely and wellappointed, the service is 100 what makes it special. There is a friendliness, warmth, and kindness to the staff that I have never experienced elsewhere to the same extent.

We stayed here postsurgery and so many people on staff went out of their way to make me comfortable and make accommodations for us. And they would ask after me each day and always seemed happy to see me as I made progress in my recovery. Just a really wonderful place to stay.

Side note I dont particularly enjoy staying in this part of NYC but we come back because the service is just so welcoming. The location is incredible. The hotel was very clean and the staff was welcoming and helpful. Had a small issue with the TV and the staff was able to offer a resolution quickly via their chat system even late in the evening. We will definitely return to this location. Highly recommend a room with a city view!! The hotel is excellent! It is conveniently located near numerous attractions such as Broadway, Times Square, the Empire State Building, the New York Public Library, Penn Station, Grand Central, MoMA, and many others. There are also plenty of great restaurants in the area.

The hotel itself boasts a lovely restaurant and bar, with room service that is fast and delivers amazing food. As a family of five 2 adults and 3 kids, we found the room service menu to be extensive and the food to be of high qualityI highly recommend trying it! The hotel service goes above and beyond, truly deserving of its 5star rating. It is worth every penny spent on both the room and food.

Excellent location for visitors. Right by the subway, inside of a half hour to all the major NYC sights. There are so many reasons for why I could never return to this hotel because if I was paid. Took us an hour to check in and the employees had no sense of urgency, moving like snails. Customer service was lacking, every person working there was passive aggressive and condescending. Each time we took the elevator, wed wait for 10 minutes minimum and then another 5 minutes inside the elevator until wed get to our floor. The room was disgusting and the layout is so poorly constructed. There were noticeable stains on the bedding and bath towels. The bathroom ceiling was falling apart, it looked like mildew growing. No body wash, only shampoo and conditioner. The bathroom was so incredibly small. Each time we opened the door, it would touch the shower door and we couldnt close it unless we were pressed up against the toilet. Housekeeping was very sloppy too. Left a dirty rag on the TV stand and didnt replace any of our towels one night. There was no mini fridge to store drinks or food. This is the first hotel Ive been to that doesnt have a mini fridge or cooler in the room. The closet was annoying. The hanging rod went from front to back wouldnt it make sense for it to be right to left? So each time the clothes and hangers would get tangled and stuck. Common sense was not used when designing this place. Hotel is in perfect location, walking distance. From 28 floor nice view. Room is cosy but small. Older furniture, water leak from shower to room. Breakfast still the same. During rush hours you have to wait for elevators. Checkout at 12 is nice benefit. Service great, we were greeted very warmly.
Everything we wanted was easy to arrange.
Rooms a bit small but clean, cleaning ladies don't understand much English.
The only minus is the that u must wait long time for the elevator. I was torn between a 3 or 4 star rating but decided on a 3 star for a couple of reasons.
1. This hotel is in desperate need of a facelift. The carpets are seriously worn, the walls have had better days and the outside doesnt look very inviting.
2. OMG the pain of these lifts elevators is real. On the day I arrived only 3 were working so that made a bad situation worse. Nightmare! I understand things will breakdown but even when 4 were working its still crazy.

The staff are super friendly and we laughed a few times with them and they really did make the difference.

The rooms were cleaned very well everyday which I couldnt fault.

The Times Square EDITION,"701 7th Ave, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.5,40.759149,-73.984164,"As a New York City local, we are not huge fans of visiting Times Square due to the large crowds and tourist traps all around, but if you insist on staying in the heart of it all then there is no nicer hotel to visit than the Times Square Edition. This property is the only 5 star hotel in the surrounding Times Square area. I visited today for breakfast. The hotel has a very cool modern feel. While Times Square has to be the least desirable place in NYC, the EDITION shines.  This hotel is my favorite for business travel.  The hotel is quite, rooms are comfortable and the service is incredible.  Shah at the front desk was incredible on my recent visit  hospitable, friendly and accommodating! Incredible location and staff. Very friendly and fast. You walk out to Times Square and are in the heart of NYC. Rooms are great too, a little small but very nice for the size and two people. Would definitely recommend for business trips or couples looking for a nice spot near Times Square for a few days. This was the first time I booked a 5 star hotel so I didnt know what to expect. I was excited to enjoy a bit of luxury and service, but apart from the really nice Le Labo scentproducts and robeslippers I couldnt really differentiate this hotel from a 4 star one. The hotel is a little older, there were old stains on the bedroom rug, amenities are pretty standard, and service was okay.

I booked directly because Ive read hotels tend to treat direct booking patrons better and it was a bonus that the mandatory per night fee was included in the price. I dont think they care here because my girlfriend booked a room via a third party site and I felt she received better service and upgrade offer. YMMV, so book with whatever is affordable to you. Dont forget about the daily fee if booking indirectly.

The checkin was straightforward, and we were offered an upgrade to a room with the Times Square view. Sounded great, so we accepted. If you book here and are offered the upgrade do not accept it unless you are a deep sleeper. There was so much noise and light pollution from the street that I had difficulty sleeping. They really should consider those rooms as a downgrade or install better black outnoise reduction curtains.

While the location is super convenient, the traffic and noise was not worth it to me. If I return to NYC, I would probably stay at other areas. Overall a 5 stars hotel.

Rooms they are nice and comfy but like all NYC hotels, very small. Good if you are traveling solo or with one companion.

Atmosphere it is a more modern and lower light hotel, so I'd say more for business trips although I did see a few families with kids.

Location this is an excellent hotel if you need to stay in Times Square. It's near all the Times Square attractions.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
The Manhattan at Times Square Hotel,"790 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.1,40.7622856,-73.9826404,"I had an excellent stay at The Manhattan Hotel, New York Times Square. The location is unbeatable, with easy access to all major shopping areas and quick availability of taxis at any time. The rooms are clean, and the air conditioning works perfectly, ensuring a comfortable stay.

The staff was incredibly courteous, especially Mr. Mohammad, who went above and beyond to assist us. He was extremely cooperative and even helped with our checkin on his day off, which was truly appreciated. The lift service was fast, so there was no waiting around, and access to the room was seamless.

Overall, a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Times Square! My stay was HORRIBLE! It took almost 45 minutes to check in despite paying in advance. My room was filthy! Its was covered in dust. When I used a Lysol wipe to clean the counters it turned black! When I turned the AC on an overwhelming order permeated the room so I immediately turned it off.

The tub was dirty and had hair on the wall. The tub had so much water trapped under the sealant I slipped and almost seriously hurt myself.

The furniture was chipped and outdated. It gives the appearance that there has been no effort to update the rooms in 20 years. The amenities were nonexistent. The room wasnt even equipped with a mini fridge, something commonly found in hotels.

Additionally, there were no washcloths in the room when I arrived. I went to the front desk and the receptionist said she would notify housekeeping. I waited for 30 minutes before calling the front desk to inquire if there were any updates. I attempted to call both the front desk and housekeeping for almost 15 minutes and didnt get a response. Just as I was waiting for the elevator to go back to the front desk, I found a housekeeper and requested a washcloth. 20 minutes later, after I had already showered, I received a knock on the door and was greeted by a housekeeper who handed me the washcloths I had originally requested over an hour earlier.

On a positive note, the location is ideal. The hotel is surrounded by a ton of restaurants, shops, and a short walk to Times Square.

In total, the wait to checkin was long, the room was covered in dust and filth, the service was horrible, but the location was great. Admittedly, if there were available rooms at another hotel I would have asked for a refund however it was Labor Day weekend so everything was sold out. I strongly discourage anyone who is considering staying at The Manhattan at Times Square. We stayed here for a five night break in September and had the best experience! All the staff were super friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel was perfect  right in the heart of Times Square! Our room was exceptional. Super clean and had everything we could need. Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making our holiday one to remember. Great location for time square.  First morning there was a huge blow up Rat outside looking in the hotel lobby with a loud blower fan outside.  We stayed in a room that was just renovated. A bit on the small side having just enough room for one person to walk around the beds at a time, two out of the four bed lights didn't work. The bathroom was dirty and missing a handle on the door with no lock. The water was very slow to drain resulting in pools of water.  Upon arrival there were no hand towels and only two bath towels for four guests. We requested more, they responded quickly with one hand and bath towel. Upon returning from our first outing the room was serviced leaving no towels. Second morning we were woken up to the maid coming in our room.  Overall the staff is nice and helpful. You're going to pay a lot of money and in the end you won't be able to sleep comfortably... at least until the renovations are finished. We understand that the renovations are intended to improve the quality of the spaces and the service, but during the process the comfort and enjoyment of the guests must be guaranteed, especially their sleep, since it is a very demanding city for tourists. In the 6 days that I stayed with my boyfriend, we had a terrible experience in terms of rest, every morning we were woken up by the loud sounds of the remodeling workers. Even though we are paying a full rate, without any type of discount, offer or promotion, we should have the right to a pleasant rest, at least they should have placed us on another floor away from the noise or found some other solution.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Lex Hotel NYC,"67 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.3,40.74095,-73.9834861,"I recently stayed at the Lex Hotel in NYC and had a great experience. The staff was always attentive, polite, and greeted us with a smile every time we walked through the door. They were incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome from start to finish.

In the mornings, they offer a simple breakfast with orange juice, coffee, fruit, and breadperfect for a quick bite before heading out to explore the city. The location is fantastic, just a short walk to a subway station and a bus stop, making it super convenient to get around. Plus, the area felt safe, which was a big plus.

The rooms are on the smaller side and a bit dated, but if youre planning to be out and about all day, they definitely do the job. Overall, Lex Hotel was a solid choice for our NYC trip, and I'd happily stay there again! The are simple but very nice and clean. The ac works great and i wasn't hot at all which is usually a problem for me in most hotel rooms. The shower is very hot which again is very nice. They have a small complimentary breakfast in the mornings and a really lovely rooftop to sit and relax. Definitely would like to come back. I love The Lex Hotel it has been my home away from home. Great safe location,excellent service and staff,nice and friendly with great service,beautiful house keeping,lovely room,clean,comfortable bed and pillows. I can't rate this place high enough, very impressed. Thank you so much for making my experience in NYC great,you guys are the best, you work so hard but always do it with a smile and a friendly chat or tell you how to get anywhere. The roof top scence was spectacular and having breakfast every morning sets you up for the day too. I am so glad I found this place! Clean compact rooms, continental breakfast, nice staff. Booked through the agency and had to pay an additional 30 usd per night at the reception. This pricing order is irritating. The location was perfect for us and the room, while basic and smelly, was fine. However, we ended up having a terrible experience. We returned late at night to our room and our key card would not work. I went down to the desk and informed the attendant. He came up with the master key and that did not work either. There was no engineer available and no failsafe in place for such an event. They were unable to offer us another room. I overheard one employee tell another that the card reader on the door had a dead battery  something that seems preventable. It took between 40 and 50 minutes for the staff to figure out how to get us into the room. They apologized, but did not offer a discount or voucher or anything else to make it right. I understand that things sometimes go awry, but being able to get into the room is a pretty essential part of paying for a hotel room. Overall a frustrating experience.","Monday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM

LIC Hotel,"44-04 21st St, Long Island City, NY 11101, USA",4.4,40.7493819,-73.9470833,"Great hotel for the value with a cool view from the rooftop. We stayed on the first floor and we didnt notice too much noise, considering the commercial area. The beds were not too comfortable, almost seemed like they bought the frames online for cheap  wiggled a bit if I shifted in my sleep. However, we chose this hotel for the location and price, its a close walk to the subway and we thought the area was safe. Staff was very nice and helped us check in with ease. We had a fridge, TV, and clean bathroom. My main complaint is the little air fresheners they have all over the lobby  it wasnt the smell, rather the strength of the smell. A very nice hotel in Queens only 4 stations away from Manhattan. The hotel is very clean, with nice and super helpful staff. Tasty breakfast, quite great choice of food, everybody can find sth. Water and tea or coffee, in the breakfast dining room all day long.  Rooms are big, and with good windows, it's silent. Choice of TV channels superb. Easy access to three subway stations in walking distance. Definitely I will come back there. Receptionists very helpful especially the lad from Korea. This hotel was very convenient. It was about a block away to the subway, breakfast was included in the hotel which is SUPER NICE, hotel was nice and quiet, the view from the roof was very nice, the place was CLEAN! Not a bug in sight. Staff was so helpful thank you to the Hispanic woman with the braces we felt very safe in the hotel, as the front doors would lock after a certain time and you could only get in with your room key card . The price was fair , I got my 100 security deposit back less than 48 hours probably earlier I had just checked my account 48 hours after checkout more than enough towels , toilet paper , and blankets were put in the room . Easy check in and check out. 1010 id recommend and stay here again ! As for the 4 star location , it wasnt that it was a bad area , it was just nothing really around the hotel to see or do. Thats the only reason location is 45 but great hotel ! The location is great  15 minutes from the center by subway. The neighborhood also has plenty of nice cafes  restaurants. The hotel had good storage facilities and breakfast space, which could also be used as communal space.

The room was also neat  tidy, with good equipment. The hairdryer, however, wasn't working in my room.

The internet was quite slow, not ideal if you're planning to work from here. My friend got treated very poorly by this hotel. Reception forgot that she had paid to extend her stay, locked her out of her room and put her clothes in garbage bags, while she was made to wait 40 minutes in the cold. When she was allowed to take a shower, they didnt provide a towel. There was no apology, no effort to make her feel comfortable.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Located in a cute town and would recommend this hotel. Rooms were clean and stocked. No complaints Perfect location for families of patients at North Shore University Hospital. Paul and the rest of the reservation team worked with us and were very flexible with our reservations. The Northwell rate for families of hospital patients at North Shore University hospital is greatly appreciated. The rooms are spacious and clean and decorated in a lovely art deco manner just like the rest of the hotel. The public spaces are lovely. We ate at the restaurant and really loved the food, selection and portion sizes, and having valet parking made our life so much easier in a busy town.  All the employees there worked hard to To help us feel less stressed. First off a big shout out to valet Mike S. From the moment we arrived he was the first person to come out and greet us. He made our arrival so pleasant. He was fast and accurate and provided us with the best of customer service. The front desk staff were great. We arrived at 100 and they were able to grant us early checkin as we had to get to our sons wedding reception. The room is a little old but hey it served its purpose. The ac worked great. The room was clean and stocked with everything we needed.  The shuttle driver to the venue was awesome. Upon return the hotel offered us a late night dinner and drinks. They were excellent and the bartender was on point pumping out the drinks immediately after asking for them. Check out was a breeze and once again the last face we seen was the valet guy Mike S who got our vehicle super fast and thanked us for staying at the inn of great neck. This hotel is highly recommended. Very nice  from our valet Parking attendants!! Rene to the front desk attendees! Accommodating and helpful! I would stay again, the location is great if you have a car, but if on foot, it's difficult because of lots of construction going on and everything was a walk, not to many shops around to browse that was a car ride away Visited Great Neck for a funeral. This hotel was very convenient and seemed a decent price given the location and reviews. Unfortunately, our room had a window that would not completely close, and the staff could not fix it, not did they offer us another room. So it was a long, sleepless, noisy, humid night. Otherwise, it probably would have been a good choice.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Sanctuary Hotel New York,"132 W 47th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.2,40.75837,-73.9832957,"Location of this hotel is spot on, within 20 minutes walk of most of New Yorks attractions. Really close to Times Square, but, away from the noise. The hotel itself is great value for money, providing a good breakfast of pastries, toast, bagels, cereal and bananas and apples as much as you want. Tea, coffee and iced water in the lobby all day. Reception and staff all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were good with everything you need, comfortable beds, lovely linen and great showers. Shout out to the housekeeping staff who were exceptional and even provided a turn down service. My only very small complaint was the lights and television being left on after the rooms had been cleaned which I thought was very wasteful. Also it wasnt necessary to have towels automatically changed every day, there was a card that you could leave on bed so the bedding wasnt changed and I think this should be available for towels too. If I stayed in New York again I would definitely stay at The Sanctuary. A beautiful old fashioned hotel, right in the heart of Mid town. Nicely decorated, the rooms are small but that doesn't matter as you use it as a base to explore. The breakfast was very simple. Toast, pastries fruit and yoghurt.
The staff were helpful, especially the concierge staff who gave us lots of advice on how to get around. Really appreciate Jay, Spencer and Eddie. Though and as they were described rooms are cozy, they were quiet which was especially appreciated, given the location. But the key win here is  the service the people who work in this hotel are kind, 5 star professional and excellent at their jobs and I'm thankful. It's uncommon. Thank you!  Marjorie We enjoyed our stay here, very central for everything but mainly time square!
The rooms have a boutique feel, slightly small but that's standard for NYC. The shower set up is strange with a curtain separating the bathroom and the room but you soon get used to it.
We found all the staff really friendly both door staff and reception. Their roof top and sushi bar are popular with people staying elsewhere wanting to experience it.
The continental breakfast is nothing to write home about and does let the experience down, it's not what I would call a continental breakfast at all but that said it's enough to fuel you for the start of the day.

We would stay again and we would recommend! Very nice hotel. Fantastic location. Rooms can be small unless you can afford the larger ones . Friendly and very helpful staff. Three restaurants onsite, two on the rooftop.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The hotel was located right in the middle of the fun. The staff was accommodating, respectful and overall fun. We got a room upgrade and champagne as a surprise for our anniversary. They made us feel special. Nicely designed, modern, smaller hotel in unusually quiet location for NYC. Pleasant onsite barlounge with limited, but tasty menu. Comfy beds. A little skimpy on the coffee supplies. Very clean but some rooms need upgraded carpeting. Good WIFI. From the moment we checked in, to checking out  everything was wonderful.  I stayed here for my birthday and  had an exceptional time. The staff were so attentive and friendly.

They even offered recommendations for dining in the area, though we already had plans. To top it all off, while my guy and I were on the massive terrace enjoying the view of the Brooklyn Bridge, we were surprised when we looked in to the room after a bit to find a bottle of champagne on ice and a lovely note from the manager!

Thank you 33 Seaport for helping to make my birthday memorable! Will definitely stay here again in the future! Jeff and his staff are incredible! We got married in the neighborhood, so we are our guests stayed at 33 Seaport the night before and night of our wedding. Every person we encountered at this hotel was kind and accommodating. The hotel itself is beautifully kept and conveniently located. We did our first look outside on the suite balcony and could not have asked for a better view! What a dream! The service and staff were wonderful but the room was just okay. It had a very loud air conditioner that shook the bathroom wall.

When we entered the room we were very excited and happy to see how updated and clean the room was. The location is not the greatest but it was close to the subway which is super convenient. On site parking was a gift to have.
If I could improve anything it would be two things. First, the shower was amazing but the floor liner in the stand up shower is a lawsuit waiting to happen way too slippery. Also, the breakfast was not the best and for how busy it was, one waffle maker is not enough. Overall though the stay was great and would recommend this hotel. My experience at the Comfort Inn Prospect ParkBrooklyn from Sept 8th to Sept 12th was amazing the location is out of the way and the walk to the nearest subway station is approximately 3 minutes the staff were so friendly and accommodating I arrived 9824 at approximately 1236 PM and I couldnt check in past 300 and the nice lady behind the desk kept my luggage behind the desk so guests wont have to haul around their things around the big city the AC was great, the breakfast was decent, staff were friendly and accommodating and answered all my questions, housekeeping were so responsive to the measures of keeping our rooms clean every time I came back from a long day my room was spotless but my only complaint is that the hotels water heater gave me nothing but lukewarm showers I wish the water was a tad bit hotter, but nevertheless, my stay was amazing. I will be returning in the near future to this pleasant, affordable hotel, so sad I didnt capture any pictures of my beautiful room. The hotel was very clean and the breakfast was good and hot. The staff were nice and helpful. The subway is a five minute walk and there are plenty of food options within walking distance. They also gave us new towels and washcloths regularly without us having to ask. The hotel is no frills no spa or rooftop pool. But the rooms are clean, the employees helpful especially the manager Filomena and the location is great near the R train, in a great neighborhood South Slope and wellpositioned to visit much of southern Brooklyn, like Red Hook or Sunset Park. Just be aware if you're driving that the parking lot isn't huge and can fill up fast. For a vacation week in New York, this hotel is ideal, but it does come with some flaws.
The towels smell weird, the breakfast variety is a bit small, and it is situated a bit on the outside of manhattan.
But, with a metro around the corner it is ideal if you dont want to pay the premium of staying in the city, and dont mind staying in a weird part of Brooklyn, then this is a good place to stay",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Heritage Hotel New York City,"18 W 25th St, New York, NY 10010, USA",3.7,40.743278,-73.99011,"This is a budget hotel in a great location.  It has a microwave, toaster, and many tables with comfortable, vinyl upholstered chairs in the common area on the ground floor.  Also a luggage storage area, a business  center and a tiny exercise room with 2 cardio machines and a resistance training machine.  Front desk staff were pleasant and helpful.  Vending machines were the only food source but there are plenty of food choices nearby.
My room was spacious for NYC, clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was modern, lighting and outlets were plentiful, and the bathroom window opened a few inches.  AC functioned well.  There was a coffee maker and I got 2 packets of coffee every day at the front desk.
The biggest deficiency was lack of a comfortable chair in my room.  There was only a metal stool.  There was no luggage stand so I used the ironing board to hold my open suitcase, which was fine.  No place comfortable to sit made the room an unpleasant place to hang out.   I am a solo traveler who spends nearly all of my time out of the hotel, so it was adequate for my needs and a great value at this price point.  The room was described as having a view of a NY landmark, with the Empire State Building shown in the background of the  room photo.  My view was mostly of other windows, with a slice of sky and the top of an historic church that is currently under renovation and partly blocked off, so not much of a view at all. So terrible. The gaps between the door and the floor were huge. I couldve easily fit my entire hand under it. Ive been to many discount hotels before and felt fine, but I would never go here again. They also had doors to adjoining rooms with very flimsy locks. I can get over the hairs in the shower and stains on the duvet because of the location, but the locks and security were horrifying. Caveat I spend little to no time in my hotel rooms when I travel, so as long as its clean, quiet, and convenient I tend to rate well. The hotel seems to be split by the stairwell and I had a room in the back half. I didnt hear the streets at all! Coffee shop next door, validated parking parking is one street over, and 50 for 24 hrs, and an A for effort in the gym lolId stay again The hotel's central location is a plus, but the room conditions were disappointing.
While the hotel's midtown location is convenient, the cleanliness of the room was unacceptable. I found hair throughout the room, the chair was too dirty to use, and the windows were smudged. The mattress was worn out and provided poor support.
Room service was inconsistent, available only one day out of three, and the water vending machine didn't accept credit cards.
The staff, however, were friendly and helpful. Horrible experience. If you want to stay here ensure that you really want to stay here and this is your best choice. If you have other locations you can go to, I would highly suggest it.

About my experience 2 hours after booking through a third part website, we had an urgent matter that came up. The hotel then would not accept any cancellations due to their ""policy"" and would refuse to transfer us to anyone apart from individuals at the front desk. I called 3 times and received the same response. Essentially this hotel will take your money and refuse to give it back regardless of what has happened on your end or how close to the booking is.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Front desk attendants were very courteous, but be prepared to wait since they are seemingly always swamped.  I think it's pretty crazy that there is a 250 deposit to stay at this location. I did receive my money back within three days. The parking situation is a mess. The spots are very tight. My partner had to circle around and wait for a spot. They were lucky that someone was leaving or else would have had to do creative parking, which is crazy for 20night. Yes, breakfast is included and was decent. The rooms are nice, quiet, and clean. The beds are comfortable. However, the therm read 69 but it did not feel that cool. In fact, I felt hot at times. I must say the neighborhood is good  there are several dining options. Really enjoyed this stay. Our flight was cancelled and we were able to take the shuttle to the hotel. Juan at the front desk was great and really appreciated him helping us and the staff taking care of us. I would highly recommend this location. Easy walking distance to the Mills at Jersey Gardens and several food options. Location is about the only thing this place has going for it.  Compared to the other Hampton Inn's we stayed in this place is a dump.  The whole property is junk.  I would definitely look to stay elsewhere.  Shower doesn't get hot, then it broke and water wouldn't even turn on, it took 2 phone calls and 2 visits to the front desk before they attempted to send someone up.  Bathroom door doesn't close all the way or even lock.  Breakfast area is dirty and food was always cold.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!
BOOK ELSEWHERE SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE. We had to stay here during the nightmare outage when our flights got cancelled for the millionth time. This place was perfect. The rooms were super nice and super clean, the complimentary breakfast was 1010, the desk staff were absolutely amazing, and the guy that drove the shuttle to the airport was so nice. Do not hesitate to book here, I honestly give it a 1010. Came in late at night and was told rooms are 399. It was already an outrageous price but there was nothing else available nearby, so I accepted. When they saw I was using a corporate card, they told me the only rooms available were actually king suites for 500 a night, and refused to honor the original rate they told me. Absolute price gouging and highway robbery. I'd have walked out if I had any other options.

As for the room itself, it was just okay. AC doesn't really get cool. Showers are lukewarm at best.

Breakfast was nothing special, but thankfully was included.

Probably would have been better off sleeping on the airport floor for the rate I was charged.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
U.S. Pacific Hotel,"106 Bowery, New York, NY 10013, USA",3.2,40.7179141,-73.9953772,"Its what you get for the price. Staff was helpful, rooms are small, the rooms bathroom was bigger than the room. But the mattresses, holy. Ive slept on 2x4s softer than that. These mattresses prompted me to make the review. I slept on the floor cause it was more comfortable. Everything else was okay, but if youre staying to, idk SLEEP, itll be a little rough. There is a furniture store across the street, maybe they can get better mattresses We stayed here overnight, having selected this hotel because it was the cheapest option in Manhattan. The hotel is conveniently located near the subway station and around plenty of Chinatowns restaurants. We arrived late and checked out early, and the location felt safe on both occasions.

The room we had was with a private bathroom. We read that not all rooms have windows, so if you want one choose a room with a bathroom. The room was very small and very basic, without microwave, fridge not working tv. The WiFi was fast enough. The room was rather clean, but the bathroom needs renovation, it is really worn down.

The lady at the reception struggled to understand English, but was polite.

What we did not like was that the hotel only stores your luggage until 5pm on the day you check out. We had to shorten our sightseeing of New York due to this policy and had to arrive at the airport many hours before the flight as a result. I wish the hotel extended the luggage storage to, say, 8pm. Would make a difference to budget travelers. Wonderful place to stay, so long as you dont need much!
The beds are comfortable, the staff is friendly, and the shampoobody wash they have is great!
The rooms are a bit small, but for the price it makes sense!
Would highly recommend, unless you want to cook your own food, as there is no kitchen or fridge to use. Absolutely phenomenal location. I cannot fault it. 20 minutes to anywhere you need. Super great location. Rooms are no thrills. But honestly when visiting youre not there for the room. Its minimal but worth it. Fellow Brits. If you see this. It's fine. Nothing glamorous but it does the job Do NOT book at US Pacific unless 1 you can get a room SUPER cheap and 2 you're a college student. I paid 160 for a crummy room. I should have paid more to stay elsewhere.

This was the second worst spot I've stayed at in NYC. The first being a motel that offered 30night rooms that literally only had a bed.

This ""hotel"" advertises a ""Double Room Private Bathroom"" as an offering, but guess what? You need to walk down the hall to use one of the shared bathrooms. It's private in that you can lock the door after yourself, I suppose, but still. Doesn't private mean the bathroom is actually IN your room?

No elevator. My room was on the third floor.

One plus? Towels were included.

Bed looked clean, but I still slept with my outside clothes on.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Motto by Hilton New York City Chelsea,"113 W 24th St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.4,40.7437277,-73.9931299,"This was the first time I stayed at the Motto and I was very impressed!  This is a newer hotel in the area so has a lot of modern touches.  I usually stay at the Hilton a block or so away, but thought Id give this a try since it was a Hilton property.

Location is fantastic!  So close to several subway lines and PATH train so its very easy to get anywhere in the city and beyond! Short walk to many sights as well.  I enjoy staying in Chelsea area because it tends to be quieter and away from the insanity of TS.  There is a coffee shop a block away and a great bagel shop.

Rooms are compact yet still very comfortable.  Its NYC, rooms are going to be small.  They have great decor, comfortable beds, and great water pressure.  It was the first time Id stayed in a hotel that has the sink outside the bathroom.  It was different, not good or bad. I was traveling solo so it didnt matter.  Rooms are immaculately cleaned.  Solid surface floors just make sense in a high traffic hotel.

The barrestaurant offers Italian inspired fare and great cocktails.  I would suggest using your daily fb credit to try one.

Service was friendly and efficient.  I am in NYC several times a year, and I will definitely be back! My stay here was terrible.
My room wasn't ready when I got there, and I had no problem with waiting since I picked the room I wanted on the app. The guy at the front desk said they had a different room available. I asked if it was located away from the elevators, because I wanted at least a little bit of quiet. He said yes, it was at the end of the hall and away from the elevators, which sounded good. Well, he lied. It was around the corner from the elevators and across from some electric or utility room, and the workers were loud.
The room itself appeared clean at first glance. But I started to notice things. The curtains were very dusty. One of the bed frames and the bathroom door were damaged. And there were a lot of stains on the bathroom door, the sink area, and the luggage table. What really got me is the lack of an ice bucket or ice machine. I've never been to a hotel that didn't have an ice bucket or ice machine.
The bed was uncomfortable, and the floor was dirty. I could feel the dirt under my feet, even with socks on. A quick look under the beds and nightstand revealed dust and dirt, like it hadn't even been vacuumed. Apart from making the beds and replacing the towels, it doesn't seem like the room was cleaned at all.
The room wasn't worth the cost, by any stretch of the imagination. Stay elsewhere. Rooms were great and felt spacious for a NY hotel. The location was wonderful as well, but the service was the best part. There was a super kind gentleman named Sam, I believe, who went above and beyond after I moved out of a lounge space for a party he was throwing for the staff. I was more than happy to allow them that space without question, but he ensured I was taken care of and offered a mealbeverage and extended checkout for the totally minor disruption. Truly a gem of a human and the hotel is lucky to have him. The hotel left me quite impressed. I regret not having stayed longer while on my trip. I loved being able to pick my room from the Hilton app. The view from my 42nd floor room was spectacular. I also loved the tech features integrated into the room, which allowed me to control the AC, TV, and more from my phone. I felt the room was beautifully decorated and modern.

Although rooms in NYC tend to be very small, the room I had felt bigger and more comfortable than other NYC hotel rooms I've stayed at. The location is great since there's a lot nearby. I will definitely stay here again when I return to the area. Modern rooms.  Like NYC, they're on the cozier side, and every sq inch is utilized.  Love the space, decor.

But most importantly, its so clean.  Impeccably clean!  I've stayed here 4 times in the last year and I've never once been disappointed.  It started with business.  And now every time I come back here for vacation if I'm visiting the city.

Water pressure is great.

Service here is A, I love the front desk staff, they're friendly and quick.

And the location is fantastic.  Literally 12 minutes from the entrance of the FM station, 34 mins from Madison Sq Park, where Shake Shack started as literally a shack.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
"The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park","50 Central Park S, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.6,40.7652719,-73.9759992,"Top notch service, location, and room. The view of Central Park and deep soaking bathtub were my favorite. I will definitely stay with them for my NYC trips. The concierge was very helpful. I had a delicious breakfast of eggs Benedict classic with ham, and there was a salmon option as well. I also had a  mixed berries fruit plate. The freshly squeezed green energy juice was perfect. The service was 5 stars. Alice was wonderful and so kind, professional and polite. I had a lovely day at The RitzCarlton NY overlooking Central Park. My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights and 3 days here. We were supposed to get a double occupancy but because our ride dropped us off a few hours before checkin we got a different room with one bed but that's okay. We had the Central Park view. The people who worked at this hotel were nice and treated us well. Long story short I won an allpaid NY trip and the travel agent who was assigned to me chose The Ritz Carlton Hotel for us. Everyone who walked into the hotel was dressed nicely and you could tell they had money lol compared to myself and my boyfriend coming from the deep South of Mississippi we didn't own any business casual attire and the employees didn't treat us any differently. The bar in the hotel has great food and a shoutout to Manny who helped my boyfriend find a weed shop lol everyone was friendly. My favorite thing at this hotel was the showers the hot water felt amazing like I was getting a massage I never wanted to get out. Hands down the place to be, across central park, the concierge was awesome in booking a last minute tour at 9 pm to midnight across New York! Fabulous from time square to little Italy, Joes Pizza and much more! Rooms clean and staff always helpful with a smile and pet friendly. They also coordinated a carriage ride around Central Park. They made our stay memorable. This hotel was not what I anticipated. While its location is undoubtedly prime, it didn't meet the RitzCarlton standards I've come to expect. The rooms felt small, with dirty windows, basic amenities, and some oldfashioned decor and furniture elements. The service was basic, lacking the attention to detail I've encountered at other locations. Moreover, given the quality, the price was steep. If you're set on the RitzCarlton experience in this city, I'd suggest exploring their other properties or considering a different hotel.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel,"811 7th Avenue, W 53rd St, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,40.7623861,-73.9820188,"The lady at front desk was very nice. And she allowed us late check out. Also, the location is good for all touristy places.

But, the room we stayed was 200 per night and it was so okayordinary. The building is super old. The rooms are super old. Closet doors are 20 or 30 years old. If this hotel was not in Times Square, they will be out of business next day. In addition, they charge a mandatory Destination Amenity Fee of 30 per room, per night, plus tax. This is like paying 15 tip on top that 200. I know there are so many people exploit tourist but hotels too 

Lastly, we had two breakfast voucher for me and my spouse, and of course our 2 and 4 years old join us and they eat with us. The server said we need 4 vouchers. And we did not have vouchers for our kids so the server said he will charge us 40 per kid. I mean first of all we were not told that and 2 voucher were enough thanks to the front desk lady 5 stars, but the server 1 star was it nice. We had an amazing time at this hotel. It is situated in a great location that is close to most tourist spots.

The lobby is very busy, so be patient, but the staff are all efficient and friendly. The reception has an elite and normal check inout and a concierge. There is a bar that serves Starbucks in the morning and then serves alcohol. We had a few drinks here and was a lovely atmosphere. The bar staff were great. There was also a restaurant that seemed to get busy, but we didn't use it. There is also a gift shop but again didn't use it. There is also a baggage hold area that they charge 6 a day, which we used. It felt secure and quite reasonable. The guy in charge was lovely.

We had a kingsize bedroom and loved our room. Very clean and tidy. The bed was huge and very comfortable. We definitely got a good night's rest. Nice wardrobe space that had an iron, ironing board, and a security safe. There were amenities for free coffee and could have been sitting on the huge sofa. The tv had your standard channels and a great size. The view outside of our window was fine.

The bathroom was very clean, and it had your standard cleaning stuff like shampoo, conditioner, and moisturiser. They have soap rather than shower gel. The sink was broken but fixed later that day. The shower was good and was part of a bathtub, too.

The housekeeping was very good, kept rooms clean every day, and were friendly.

I would say the downside would be the lifts. They take a while to get going, and when it gets busy, they can be a bit trying at times especially when people didn't understand how they worked you had to press your floor on the control panel and go to the lift number that the panel tells you.

All in all, loved this hotel when we were here. The best things about this hotel are their location and how far the 30 destination fee will go in the hotel cafe.

Not great

1 reception staff is curt, unsympathetic, and prefers to argue than hear your concerns.

2 this is a deeply worn hotel with literal cracks in the ceiling. What was once a glamorous building in the heart of theater district is now a forlorn and faded blot. The rooms are clean, but linens are low quality, electronics are at least a decade old, and everything looks tired.

For the cost, you can stay at some Marriott properties in Chelsea or TS that are modernized and fresher looking.

Surprisingly, the 30 destination fee bought me a good amount in the hotel cafe. The location, as previously mentioned, cannot be beat. Every major train line is nearby or within a few blocks walk.

If you are a New York firsttimer or here just for the room, you'll feel really special staying here. Otherwise, find something that puts in some effort. My wife and I picked this location for our little getaway from kids weekend. The only great thing about this hotel is the location. It is strategically placed near great tourist attractions and restaurants near midtown. Other than that, the hotel is not well maintained. The cleanliness is not so great. The room was  unremarkable. Too simplistic. Service and management wise, it is subpar. They could have scheduled more people at pick check in or check out times to avoid long lines. As I said, the only great thing is their there location. Everything else is average or below average. Honestly the only possible thing I can think of that is worth the rating of 4 stars is the age and upkeep of the room. The room itself is spacious for New York and affordable for its location however the hallways carpets are peeling with the concrete slab showing under. Inside my room the vent on top of the shower was full of dust, and would have been easy to clean beforehand. In my room there was also cracks in the wall with a patch coming off. However the service I experienced especially with housekeeping is keeping this rating high. The amenities are also amazing, 2 free waters per day from the gift shop and 30 to spend in the hotel. The 30 was useful for purchasing a meal at the library bar. I would come back here as though the rooms could have been kept more attainable, the conditions were not horrible to the point I could not stay.

The Kimberly Hotel,"145 E 50th St, New York, NY 10022, USA",4.6,40.7563119,-73.9714091,"The Kimberly hotel is charming. I stayed in a suite and it was very large and nicely decorated in a sort of antique style. The lobby is pleasant, and there is an amazing aquarium outside the restaurant. The staff was consistently pleasant. I have only two suggestions first, one of the elevators is broken and apparently has been so for some time. Get it fixed. This is NY. Hustle. Second, I recommend making the light bulbs in the rooms consistently softwhite. The occasional daylight bulb is jarring. After visiting NYC for most of my life and having less than extraordinary experiences i accidentally found the Kimberly. Now i will not stay anywhere else!  This is at least my 10th stay and as usual the experience was fantastic. The rooms  i always get a suite are reasonably priced for the city, very large and well appointed.  However, the best part is the staff who are either very well trained or just unbelievably friendly. The location of this hotel is perfect. The midtown location allows you to easily walk to central park or to the Theater district. This visit i was asked whether i wanted anything in the room upon arrival ans since i was arriving having had no dinner ordered a bottle of wine and a fruit and cheese platter. It was a perfect way to end a ling day! Highly recommend. Great bell hop service. Ralph was incredibly accommodating and provided customized service during our stay. All staff were welcoming. Location was adequate for our entire stay.  Great hotel option while in NY! I hesitate to rate The Kimberly so high as then everyone will want to stay at this gem. Rooms are large for NYC, clean and well kept, nicely appointed. With that, the staff is the standout! Courteous, professional but funny and engaging and always there to assist. We stayed as it was central to all the things we had planned. You could find a hotel closer to the touristy attractions but those come with all the challenges and at a comparable or higher price. 1510 would stay here again. Harry the doorman is simply the best.. Just completed a 3 night stay at The Kimberly. I am originally from NY and try to bring my daughter as often as possible. We normally book right next to the train station but decided to splurge this time. I will never not stay at here from now on. Still close to everything and I have never received as good and kind service in NY. The doormen would apologize to you if you had to push the revolving door even for a second on your own. Not intrusive at all, just so accommodating and lovely. And the rooms were so much more spacious than I am used to with lovely touches. So so happy and loved the balcony and views.

Courtyard New York Manhattan/Times Square West,"307 W 37th St, New York, NY 10018, USA",4.3,40.7544949,-73.9925695,"I am a Marriott Platinum member, and my recent stay at the Courtyard Marriott Times Square Manhattan was extremely disappointing. Despite my loyalty to the Marriott brand, this experience has left me frustrated and disheartened.
First, despite my explicit request for a room with two queen beds to accommodate my father and me, we were given a cramped, small room with only one king bed. This was not just inconvenientit was unacceptable and showed a complete disregard for my preferences and status.
The bed in the room was another major issue. It was extremely hard and uncomfortable, making it nearly impossible to get a decent night's sleep. This lack of comfort significantly impacted our stay.
The receptionist added to the negative experience with their arrogant attitude and disrespectful behavior. As a loyal Marriott customer, I expect to be treated with courtesy and professionalism, which was completely lacking in this instance.
Furthermore, the room lacked basic amenities such as water bottles and a microwave, which I have always found in other Marriott properties. This lack of essentials made our stay even more uncomfortable.
The hotel's promotional images are incredibly deceptive. They promised beautiful views, but the reality was a room facing an old, rundown building with an unpleasant view. This baitandswitch tactic is deeply frustrating and misleading.
To top it all off, when I brought food from outside, the hotel failed to provide even basic paper plates. This is a standard service that even the lowestcategory Marriott hotels offer. The inability to accommodate such a simple request was the final straw in an already miserable stay.
This experience has severely damaged my respect for the Courtyard Marriott brand. Based on this visit, I will not be staying at this hotel again, nor will I consider the Courtyard chain for future stays. I am deeply disappointed and urge the hotel to take these issues seriously to prevent future guests from enduring the same frustrations.

By all means avoid this hotel. This hotel exceeded all our expectations! We booked it last minute and it was one of the most affordable options. We got a spacious king room with big windows and lots of natural light super rare for NYC Times Square hotels haha

The staff was very nice and huge thanks to butler for helping us with storing our luggage! Def would stay here again Overall we had a good stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful, happy to answer our questions and provide recommendations as it was our first time in NYC. The room was small but that is to be expected. It was extremely clean and the water pressure was adequate. The AC was wonderful. The only downfall is the walls being so thin you could hear the doorselevatorpeople in the halls very easily.

It is in walking distance to Times Square and Penn Station which was convenient, but the area is sketchy. There were multiple people outside the lobby asking for money  following us down the street when we would leave the hotel. There is an addictionshomeless shelter next door that we were unaware of which explains the circumstances.

Overall, I would stay here again if it were an adult trip but I would not return with children because of the area itself. This hotel is close to so many things.  The rooms appeared to be recently renovated.  They were so clean and.  The room was a good size for a hotel in Manhattan.  We had two queen beds.  The beds were firm. The air conditioning was superb.  There is a little refrigerator in the room.  There were so many usb and outlets to plug in all your devices.  There were plenty of towels.  There is a security at the door.  They had a nice little lounge in the lobby for evening cocktails and theres an outdoor seating area.  We left before coffee was available, but there was Starbucks available. Lots of food options in the area. About one block from MSG and Penn Station. Highly recommend, will be back. Nice, convenient location close to Times Square, parking , and a great breakfast place across the street. Elevators take a long time to arrive at certain busy hours. Rooms are nothing special, but theyre clean, and you probably arent staying in them much except for sleep if youre hiding the city.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
"Mandarin Oriental, New York","80 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.6,40.7689873,-73.9830172,"I stay at the Mandarin Oriental Miami once a month. This past week was my first time staying at the New York location and it was an amazing experience. The room and view was stunning. Im a very picky eater and I thought the food was incredible. The employees are so nice, Tully was so helpful. Truly an incredible experience all the way around! I hope to be back for my birthday in November! Exceptional service. Treat yourself to the Afternoon Tea. It is delicious, the view is spectacular, and the staff is so courteous, gracious and accommodating. The best experience we had in NYC, and we did a lot of wonderful things. The location close to the park is perfect, because it's easy to get away from the hectic city center. Our room had an amazing view of the central park and was big enough for a small family. I asked the front desk for a slipper and it took me near 30 minutes to wait my slippers to come, but at the end it didnt come. I have been wasting my times for 30 minutes for waiting a slipper. The service here doesnt sounds any like a upper level hotel! Absolutely perfect! Thank you! My partner and I enjoyed every hour of our 6 night stay!

Hyatt Grand Central New York,"at Grand Central Terminal, 109 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.1,40.7520617,-73.9762995,"The Hyatt Grand Central has been one of my goto hotels in midtown for over 10 years. It is conveniently located, with easy access to transit and lots of walkable options for food and services.  Sadly, the maintenance and service have diminished considerably.

Only some of the rooms are renovated the rest have bathrooms one would expect to find in an actual train station, with rusted and old fixtures, faucets that leak, and showers that don't turn on completely.  Inroom amenities are lacking irons and many power outlets don't work, there aren't coffee or tea stations, and even drinking glasses are missing.  Housekeeping makes the beds, but doesn't dust, sweep, or replace towels.

Overall customer service is spotty.  The front door attendants are lovely and welcoming, but front desk staff are inattentive, and security are slow to respond to concerns.  This is not a hotel focused on service or hospitality anymore. A small  but telling  example of this shift in attitude is that they charge 4 per item to hold bags when checking in or out.  This is not a big thing  but it speaks volumes.

This hotel no longer lives up to the Hyatt brand standard. If you wish to stay in the immediate area, there is a Westin a block east that is lovely. Location is very convenient. But, its not clean around that area. Service, they charged extra and no refund. They text me  Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback regarding your recent stay. I apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced while with us. Rest assured your concerns will be addressed.

I do hope for the opportunity to regain your trust, welcome you back and make it up to you. Should your travels bring you back to NYC please dont hesitate to contact me directly. I would personally oversee your next stay with us to ensure it is exceptional. 
but never happen. The outside of the hotel is dirty with vacant lease space. The lobby is nice and has a nice market cafe. However our room had seen better days and desperately needed an update and a deep clean. Location is the best part of this hotel but next time Id stay at the Westin across the block. It's a decent hotel. That's it really. It's not amazing and it's not poor. The rooms are very stayable but definitely not grand or overly relaxing. Could probably do with a refurb. Bed comfortable, shower decent, room size for our king was decent for central Manhattan.

The service however is poor. No help with bags from kerbside or at checkin, just had to take em all including baby and pushchair ourselves. Housekeeping didn't seem to want to provide toiletries, no shower gel or shampoo in room and they claimed they were out of stock! Only after approaching reception did this get rectified.

It's functional, I'd definitely stay here again if price was right but just don't expect massive hospitality despite this being a well known hotel. I was a bit reluctant to stay here, because of some negative reviews, but my husband and I had a perfectly fine experience here. We got upgraded to a large suite, which was well appointed though it could have been a bit cleaner and was surprisingly quiet given it was in the heart of midtown. Our room even had a cool view of the Chrysler building which was a great surprise! We liked the outdoor space in the Commodore club area, which was a comfortable place to work, and the snack and drink offerings at the club were convenient and tasty. As Globalists we also got a generous 15 credit at the property's convenience store, plus access to the buffet breakfast, which was tasty. The location was extremely convenient. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to stay here again, given other more charming boutique properties in the city, but our stay exceeded expectations, and was comfortable. Plus the property treated Globalists very generously.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The St. Regis New York,"Two E 55th St, New York, NY 10022, USA",4.5,40.7613979,-73.9746128,"Definitely the best hotel I've ever stayed in.
As soon as I pulled up, the doorman open the door to the car I was in and greeted me and immediately helped me with getting my bags out of the back.
I am visually impaired and he helped me get to the checkin desk and bring my bags up to my room.
When I checked in, due to my Platinum status with Marriott, I got a massive upgrade. I got upgraded from a superior room all the way up to the Madison suite on a high floor. The butler offered to show me around the room because of my visual impairment and their attention to detail was great. And due to the renovations that are currently going on in the lobby, a staff showed me around. The Madison one bedroom suite is massive and decorated extremely well. The flooring is nice, the marble tub and marble in the bathroom are great, that highend wood trim along the ceilings is beautiful and the chandeliers are incredible.
Even though it was a short stay, it was definitely worth staying here.
Overall the St Regis definitely met and exceeded my expectations. Disappointing Stay Below St. Regis Standards

1. Checkin and Checkout
Upon arrival, our room wasnt ready, so we left our bags at the front desk. We were assured they would be moved to our room once it was available, but this never happened. Additionally, we had requested a late checkout for 4 PM, which was confirmed. However, on the day of departure, we were unexpectedly called in the morning and told that the checkout time had been moved up to 1 PM.

2. Butler Service
The butler service was slower than expected. When I paged them, there was a significant delay before they responded. I also requested more chocolates to be delivered to the room, but the butler refused, insisting they were already there, which was frustrating.

3. Destination Fee
The hotel charges a destination fee, which includes a 50 daily credit for services like the hair salon or room service. However, the salon services start at 100, making the credit largely unusable. The 50 credit also expires daily, limiting its utility. Furthermore, the room service menu was limited, and there were additional fees, including an 8 delivery charge and a mandatory 20 tip, making it feel unreasonable.

4. Housekeeping
Throughout our stay, housekeeping became increasingly inconsistent. While towels and soap were refreshed, other items like the notepad, postcards, and envelopes were not replenished towards the end of our stay.

5. Noise
The hotel is currently surrounded by road construction, which made the area extremely noisy. The noise could be heard clearly from our room, which disrupted the overall experience.

6. Room Upgrade
As lifetime Titanium members, we were disappointed that we did not receive a room upgrade, which was unexpected given our loyalty status. Beautiful hotel, convenient location. Five stars for both of those.

One star for service because a butler service is advertised, yet a substantial charge is made for a request to move the minibar. I can ask anything of the butler except this. Not trying to discount the job done by the butler, but it feels like the hotel is punishing you for not allowing the racket of charging you for moving items. Leaves a sour taste in your mouth about the entire experience, and is absolutely the fault of some corporate MBA. As one would expect, the staff was extremely polite, professional, and helpful. I also received a very generous room upgrade.

However, despite that butler service was advertised in my room description, even prior to the upgrade, I was never introduced to a butler and no such service was rendered. This would have been nice, since it was supposed to be included in the rate that I paid.

The room also felt extremely dated. I understand that they were undergoing a renovation, though.

I will likely not try this property again until after their renovation is complete.

Over the last four years, I've stayed 325 nights at various Marriott priorities, including many St. Regis and Ritz locations. So, I feel like I have a good sample size to compare to and don't think I'm being overly picky. We came in August and the hotel common areas were being refurbished which we were aware of before arrival.

The best part of our 6 night stay was the room and the beds.

Arrived to the hotel and they have their concierge on the lower ground floor which is not ideal when you need help with bags.

Breakfast was served in their ballroom. Spectacular views

Their butler service is nice but for the 6 nights you get a different butler per day which defeats the purpose.

All in all  will give them another go when the hotel is done but Ill skip it until the refurbishment is done",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Conrad New York Midtown,"151 W 54th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,40.7634658,-73.9806007,"Great hotel at an unbeatable location. I have to highlight the friendliness of the staff and the great service, they welcomed us very well and immediately greeted our daughter with a small gift little teddy bear , great little gesture and very well received.

Hotel room was great, very large with a small living room and a massive bathroom. The beds were great, slept off my jet lag in a matter of days. Would come back here again in the blink of an eye, such a great location and so many touristic highlights at walking distance. I had a great experience here at the Conrad.  I'm a Diamond Hilton member please note, they will no longer be under Hilton soon, and my King room was upgraded to a suite.  The lady at the front desk was pleasant and very professional.  She got me checked in quickly and explained my AMEX benefits.
My room was very spacious.  Bathroom had great water pressure.  My only issue was the bed and pillows.  My pillows were super flat and the bed was uncomfortable.
The decor was tasteful  and the elevators were quick. The bellman was helpful with my luggage and hailing a cab, as necessary. The location is great in Midtown.  It gets you away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but still close if that's your thing. Although we enjoyed our 3day stay, I wouldn't consider this a 5star hotel, instead it's a solid 4star, in my opinion. The location is great  easy 10 out of 10. However, the amenities and service underwhelmed me. Housekeeping never replenished our wash cloths after taking the ones we used out of the shower. We had to ask for new wash cloths each day of our stay. Our AC wasn't cooling the room properly on the first night and maintenance was called to inspect. When he looked at the air filter he let out a gasp...it was filthy and looked like it hadn't been changed in years. A new air filter quickly corrected the issue. The restaurant had overpriced mediocre food and drinks. My favorite thing about the stay was the byredo products and the insane shower water pressure. We would stay here again if the price made sense, but at the price point we paid for our stay, the hotel fell a little short for us. Priced at a 5star hotel. Service of a motel. An hour after my call, and was still waiting for the bedding that they told me they'd get up urgently. After 2 calls down, then stopping down, I called again and they go 'oh, it has been so long they thought you fell asleep"". Terrible...

Oh, plus there was the previous occupants milk left in the fridge it was open. We also walked back to the hotel at one point and when getting into the elevator, the one bell hop walked into the employee area and screamed obscenities so loud, it was like he was talking right next to us and my 7year old caught up on that immediately. That was completely unprofessional.

The breakfast was pretty awful. I've never had a drier potato than the ones they served here with breakfast. The eggs were cooked but beyond that, there is nothing more I can say there. They have a 'continental"" and ""full buffet"" option but unfortunately, the ""full buffet"" option is what you'd consider continental at most places. AND, it just wasn't good. All that said, our waiter took 15 minutes to speak to us  I may have fallen asleep before the coffee arrived.

It wasn't all bad  the bar tender was great, one of the receptionist was awesome and the one bell hops was fantastic!

That being said, this is probably the worst hotel I've stayed in over the last 12 months and all they had to do was try .... I CALLED THE PHONE NUMBER GIVEN UNDER THIS REVIEW, AND AN OPERATOR ANSWERED AND GAVE MORE FEEDBACK, TO WHICH THEY RESPONDED IN A MANNER LIKE ""SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?"" HOW CAN EVERYONE BE SO UNKIND AND RUDE?

I had high expectations for this hotel based on a previous visit that left me thoroughly impressed. Unfortunately, this time around, I was disappointed with the noticeable decline in service and overall upkeep.

The hotel, including the rooms, appeared to be poorly maintained and felt rundown compared to before. The minibars were fully stocked with items for purchase, leaving no space for personal items. Unlike my last visit, I was unable to secure an additional refrigerator as they were all in use. I was promised one the next day but received no followup. To make matters worse, the inroom phone was broken, forcing me to use my cellphone to call the hotel using a number I found on Google Maps.

The staff's demeanor was starkly different from the warm and friendly attitudes I encountered before. They were blunt and unhelpful across multiple interactions. When I called for room service, the person taking my order was rude, and the person delivering the meal expected me to hold the door and did not express any gratitude. I also had to clear the table myself. The restaurant staff on the first floor were equally unwelcoming and seemed eager to rush us out.

The final straw came during my last dinner when I found a bug in my chocolate cake. I pointed it out to the waiter, who replaced it without a single word of apology. Additionally, there were days when basic toiletries like mouthwash and cotton swabs were not replenished.

I am truly disheartened by the decline in both the condition of the hotel and the quality of service, which significantly tainted my experience.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
New York Marriott Downtown,"85 West Street At, Albany St, New York, NY 10006, USA",4.3,40.7095206,-74.0144862,"I stay at this hotel for business a few times a year. The property is clean and is in a great location. My recent stay was as successful as the previous visits. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly as always. This time I worked with Nicky and she was incredibly welcoming and friendly. She was also kind enough to recognize my Gold Elite status and provide me with a complimentary upgrade to a Junior suite room 1615. I definitely recommend this property. I have a YouTube channel where I post videos of hotel rooms, because I once searched for a particular hotel and could not find any recent videos or pictures. The hotel was located in a great location! We had a nice partial view of the river. The bedding was stainedsoiled, and the television not functioning properly. The shower sprayed into the ceiling, and after all of the issues, I think I checked out while finishing my stay. Came here for a team event, at over 500night. Room size is reasonable compared to some of the options in area, but will personally never come back due to the complete lack of cleanliness standards and service quality here vs other hotels around.

When I got to my room, I saw a man's hair sitting on the fitted sheet, suggesting they likely never changed the sheet between guests. I called up for new sheets to put on top of the old ones and to sleep on, then asked the next day for them to have housekeeping replace the sheets. When I got back later that night, I saw housekeeping had just left the same sheets and simply tucked in the duvet I know this because they left both the old sheet and the new fitted sheet I had put on the bed.

Also not sure they vacuum, as I had dropped a pillow on the floor and it immediately stuck with more of the man's hairs.

Clearly they are taking major shortcuts on cleanliness and basic standards at this hotel to save costs. Similarly, had a colleague observe that they waited over 18 hours before picking up a plate of old leftover seafood that sat in the hallway overnight and well into the next day, despite them calling multiple times to the front desk to pick up.

Front desk members sound disconnected and clearly don't care, while housekeeping is not doing the bare minimum. Not worth it for the price here. I know Hilton and Hyatt maintain much higher standards in the ones I've stayed at in Downtown. Stayed here on our most recent visit and was able to use my free nights here! We were able to get early check in and late check out which was so nice! The hotel it self is very well kept and beautiful, and upon our arrival the door man was so friendly welcoming and delightful! The rooms here are exceptionally large for NYC standards which made staying here very comfortable! The beds were very comfortable and we were on the back side of the hotel so it wasnt loud when we were trying to sleep. We were there on a holiday weekend so the value of our room was 500 per night, while I wouldnt have paid that to stay here normally I was happy to have maximized my reward nights.

The only downside to our visit was the location which I was aware of prior to booking and is not the hotels fault. Previously in other areas of the city LES its very easy to navigate where you are and how to get the the subway and I think the large building made it hard for our GPS to work well, and a lot of the streets arent set up in a true grid so theres a lot of half streets. Nothing majorly bad but we never really felt confident if we were headed the right way or not whereas in other areas it was easier in past visits to know where we needed to head towards. Again nothing thats the hotels fault but just something to consider when booking here. We had a very nice three night stay for my mothers bday. I do wish there was better access to executive lounge weekends. The food at Bills was not great and grew tiresome as a comp breakfast.

Nice view for the room. Very friendly folks working the front desk as well.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

From the moment we arrived, the staff was welcoming and attentive, making sure every detail of our stay was perfect. The room was beautifully appointed, with all the amenities I needed to feel comfortable and at home. The location is fantastic, right in the heart of New York City, making it easy to explore all the nearby attractions. I especially appreciated the elegant atmosphere of the hotel, which blends modern luxury with a touch of classic New York charm. We really liked this hotel! The rooms were very nice looking, big and clean thoroughly cleaned every day in an amazing location  there was a free Nespresso coffee and water bottles in the room. Some drawbacks were bad isolation of the room, a view facing the backyard, no natural light in the room and lacking possibility of opening the window. Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend this hotel! Great location!  We enjoyed our stay and being close to everything.  The rooms were fresh and clean and for the most part the staff was super friendly.  There were only a couple of nitpicky things that were missing from the room that we would like to have seen.  There were no mirrors except the one bathroom mirror.  Typically we see a mirror in the wardrobes or closets that are full length.  This makes it nice when getting ready to go out on the town.  Also there was only one small hook in the bathroom for hanging up towels, robes etc.  They give you 2 nice robes so it would be great to have a place to hang them up.  Like I said small things but nice to have.   Other than those 2 things we really loved our stay and will definitely be back! Spent the weekend here with my family. We had a great experience. The front desk was very kind and gave us some great recommendations. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The location was amazing for everything that we wanted to do. Will definitely be coming back soon! The Quin by Hilton in NYC is a remarkable hotel that offers an exceptional experience for its guests.

The Grand NYC Apartments,"38 W 31st St, New York, NY 10001, USA",2.6,40.7470989,-73.9878057,"SCAMMED me out of 250. They said they only accepted cash, I gave them 30050 deposit for 1 night for my fiancs birthday. They didnt inform us that there was a triple bunkbedso we couldnt even sit up or that we would be sharing a bathroom with an entire floor of peoplethe bathroom was filthy and there were only 4 showers total, 2 for men and 2 for women. After seeing this we went back downstairs to get a refund and find somewhere elsewe werent even there for 10 minutes. The worker downstairs said that Id have to wait for the manager to come back monday to give me the 250 back and he only gave me the 50 deposit back. I also spoke to the manager on the phone and she assured me Id get my refund on Monday. I came all the way back on Monday only for her to tell me that I couldnt get my money back and she lied and said that I told her I had sex in the room. We wouldve been there much longer if we were having sex. I called the police and they said that theyve received several complaints about the manager doing that to people but that its a civil issue so I reported them to the BBB and yet somehow theyre still open.. literally had the bellhop call the cops on me when i had just gotten there, for something that i did not do and was not a part of. worst service anywhere that i have ever gone, for any reason, ever! Although I only stayed here once and for just one night, it was an awesome stay. Easy online reservation, easy check in, and quick checkout. I believe depending on the room, you have to wait for them to go and check your room for the deposit return, but I waited only about 15 minutes. I'm not sure why you guys have such bad reviews, but I suppose some people had better expectations. Parking garage directly across the street, ESB around the block and The Edge down the block. Close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Nonetheless, I would definitely stay again and definitely recommend.  Ive never been in a smaller studio apartment with 3 other people but lets say it was okay the room itself even though there was no normal window as it was supposed to. The whole place was really creepy. The staff were very arrogant and mean. I honestly never had worse experience anywhere in US. Only the location is good and close to the Empare State building and other sights of the city. The worst hotel I have ever seen.

The Fifth Avenue Hotel,"1 W 28th St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.7,40.7449544,-73.9877067,"This hotel sets a new standard, highlighting what many 5star properties often overlook exceptional attention to detail. From checkin to the end of your stay, every moment is thoughtfully managed. The owner has clearly curated a team that truly understands the meaning of toptier service and delivers it flawlessly. Whether you're traveling for business or enjoying a staycation, your experience here will be nothing short of outstanding. I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Portrait Bar at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. I was thoroughly impressed by the hospitality service I received from the Maitred, Kendra. From the moment I entered, I was greeted with warm smiles and genuine enthusiasm.

The bartender, Lana, was exceptionally knowledgeable about the drink menu and took the time to recommend a fantastic cocktail drink based on my preference. The cocktail struck a perfect balance between refreshing acidity and subtle sweetness, complemented by expertly crafted flavors which included pink grapefruit one of my favorites. The presentation was elegant, with a vibrant garnish that enhanced its visual appeal.

Throughout my visit, the Maitred checked in regularly to ensure I had everything I needed without being intrusive. The exceptional service, attention to detail, and warm hospitality truly made a memorable experience. I highly recommend a visit if you are in the area! We had an amazing first stay at The Fifth Avenue Hotel. We were particularly impressed with the design of the guestrooms. Every detail was beautifully thought through. From supplying a laptop for guestuse, to a surprise and delight champagne toast on turndown to seamlessly shipping a leftbehind clothing item after checkout, Philip, Don and the Butler Team were first rate and personable. Breakfast in the Conservatory and drinks at Portrait Bar hit the spot. We will return again! I had the pleasure of staying here for 2 glorious nights! I was greeted by name as the doorman opened the door to my cab. My belongings were taken to my room right away. The front desk checked me in seamlessly and then the young lady gave me a tour of the property and took me to my room where I was greeted by my butler with a lovely beverage. The customer service was amazing and above and beyond for my entire stay. This property was clearly conceptualized with the customer in mind and how they could make staying here an experience that sets them apart from other properties. My room was beautiful and well appointed with the everything from the TV to the room lighting and temperature being controlled with a tablet, so you never have to leave your very comfortable bed. I will definitely be staying here again. The Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York truly sets itself apart from the typical city experience. The service standard here is exceptional, far surpassing the New York average. The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive, making every guest feel special. The bar and restaurant are super cool, offering a chic and relaxing atmosphere with fantastic food and drinks.

Wythe Hotel,"80 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249, USA",4.5,40.7218694,-73.9581,"Cool  interesting hotel, but the ongoing street noise throughout the night is extraordinary. I knew it was a noisy area with a club on the weekends, but the party  along with roaring cars and the screaming and yelling from the sidewalk, was nearly as bad throughout Sunday night. And, the trashrecycling trucks loading up literally below our window before dawn took away any chance of a restful morning.  I was pleased to find this hotel and really want to love it, but that's just not possible  unless you're a vampire. To all others, stay away! The Wythe Hotel provided us with a beautiful setting for our special day. The industrialchic ambiance and timeless vibe of the venue perfectly matched the aesthetic we were going for. The panoramic views added that extra touch of magic to the occasion, making it truly unforgettable.

The staff at the Wythe Hotel were incredibly attentive and accommodating throughout the planning process. They had an organized portal that made it easy for us to map out every detail of the event, ensuring that everything ran smoothly on the day.

While the penthouse suite offered a breathtaking backdrop for our cocktailstyle reception, we also appreciated the reasonable pricing for such a prime location. It allowed us to have our dream wedding without breaking the bank.

In terms of dining options, the Slider Bar and french fries provided a unique and delicious alternative for dinner. Our guests raved about the creativity and quality of the menu choices, adding an unexpected and fun element to the evening.

Although all of the event spaces in the hotel are amazing, we had an intimate gathering with 36 guests held penthouse suite. We had our ceremony on the terrace with the Manhattan Skyline behind us and our cocktail style reception was held in the the suite and we enjoyed dancing on the terrace which was lit up with awesome marquee lights and the skyline view at night was breathtaking.

We also stayed at the hotel for the weekend of our wedding. We requested a 2nd floor terrace room which was perfect and gave us a small outdoor space which we enjoyed especially during the photos and getting ready as that can get hectic and there tends to be a lot of people coming and going during this time. We also did our first look on the terrace which was intimate and private. The room was spacious and the industrial vibe was great for the getting ready photos.

Overall, our experience with Wythe Hotel was overwhelmingly positive. We truly couldn't have asked for a better place to host our celebration and we felt the entire hotel exceeded our expectations. From the stunning views to the attentive service and creative cuisine, Wythe Hotel truly helped make our wedding day a dream come true. Ill start with the positives. The Wythe is in a good location, with beautiful views of downtown and the water.

Now the negatives. First, theres an extremely loud club pumping music every night, in addition to the noise from the restaurant on the floor above us. It was very hard to sleep although the bed was comfy. The rooms are nothing special. Although spacious, the floors are bare concrete and could use a rug, and the shower was a tad moldy. Finally, there are no standard amenities like a gym or even in room yoga mats or coffee in the morning. Youre really just getting the bare room itself. We even had to ask for an iron, which seems like something every hotel in the US offers. All in all, very meh. I cant share enough about how much my husband and I love our stays at The Wythe. We found ourselves alone this Christmas season and decided to book a two nights stay and because we loved it so much ended up adding a third night.  We brought Martha, our pup too. The staff was BEYOND kind and attentive to us. The rooms we stayed in one room the first two nights and a different because we decided to stay last minute night three were spotless and beautifully decorated. Le Crocodile and the rooftop bar are not to be missed. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner with Le Crocodile. Located in a wonderful, walkable neighborhood. I say time and time again I cant wait for my next stay at The Wythe. I recommend it to friends constantly. Sooo much noise inside the hotel. Water pipes in room are super loud and will go off all times day and night. They blast music that can heard in the rooms til midnight. No coffee.

"InterContinental New York Times Square, an IHG Hotel","300 W 44th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.3,40.7586608,-73.9893761,"Overall the room was decent, but not a 4 star experience like advertised. Our bathroom had so much active mold growing. See pictures below the shower head had active mold growing and hasnt been cleaned  ever. All of the grout has active mold growing. Each handle to grab on to has mold growing on it. The bed was comfortable and wasnt too much noise pollution from the street below. Check in service was good they said rooms would be available by 300pm instead of 400normal check in. I recently celebrated my birthday in NY at the Intercontinental in Times Square for 3 nights. It was a great stay. The entire staff was so friendly, helpful, and accommodating. From the moment I arrived, checkin was fast  efficient and every staff member was so welcoming from the front desk staff, bell hop and concierge. I love the fact that you needed to use your keycard to access your room floor. This made me feel very safe. Our bags were brought to the room and the bell hop provided a few food recommendations. The location of the hotel is super convenient, directly located in the theatre district and  2 min walk to Time Square. A subway station is located next to the hotel. Our room, corner room on 19th floor, was pretty spacious. We had a slight view of Time Square. Everything was clean although the bathroom shower could use extra cleaning.  The bathroom was big and it was very comfortable to get ready in. Highly recommend staying here! My stay here has been great. The staff is very cordial and helpful. The housekeeper Janice is so thorough when she is cleaning my room. She makes sure I have enough towels and that the room is immaculate. Charles from bell service is very helpful and kind. He always has a smile on his visit and quick to provide assistance without me asking. Horrible experience. The front desk staff are unfriendly and rude the African American lady especially was very rude, condescending, and unhelpful. Based on other reviews, I am not the only one to have a bad experience with her.
On the first night, we were given a room on the fourth floor. The room wasn't prepared for guests the minibar wasn't stocked, we were missing towels, the TV didn't work, and the alarm clock was broken. There was no view all we could see was the car parking garage.
We switched rooms the next day, and the view was better, the TV was on with a welcome message, and everything worked. Also, the shower was completely differentbetter  it wasn't a tub like the one in the previous room, it was a walkin shower. On the other hand, the room is not soundproof at all. You can often hear the loud noises from the city or the people in the hallway.
There wasn't anything in the room that stated the prices of things in the minibar, so we called them. Multiple times, we were told the water was 12 and both juices were 9. The rest of the days we stayed, there were no big issues. We asked for one water and one juice to be restocked each day, and we thought we were staying within the 25 voucher. One kind worker let us know that if you remove an item from its spot, it will automatically charge you even if you don't drink it.
When we checked out, there were about 50 of extra charges. There is a high tax on everything in the minibar, so the water is actually about 16 and the juice is about 12. The rude lady I mentioned earlier showed us a paper where all the prices were listed, and told us that we should've read the part about the restocking fee and tax. Please note that we didn't have this paper in our room, or anything else that told us the pricesinformation. We took our business to a different front desk worker, and he immediately waived the fees, although he was very unfriendly.
We found bottles of the same water that were selling for 3 next door. Also their fridge is so full that you can't put any of your own groceries in.
We also were not told that the amenity fee is optional, depending on if you wish to use amenities or not. When we were checking out, we heard another front desk worker asking someone if they wished to use the amenities for an amenity fee. We were not asked this, but we were still charged about 40 per day even though we didn't use the amenities at all.
Overall, absolutely horrible experience. Do not stay at this hotel. The only good part is that we were right next to the subway station. Stayed a recent weekend.  Location is superb for the theater  times square district. Checkin was a breeze.  The hotel is very clean and modern.  The room was spacious and white glove clean.  The view of 8th Av was perfect from the 21st floor.  The elevators were fast and frequent.   The breakfast buffet in the Stinger restaurant was excellent. The bellhop and baggage storage  retrieval was great.  You get what you pay for here.  Top notch.  If I had to lodge some type of complaint, here it is  the mini bar cube fridge in the room is stocked to the brim with every imaginable beverage.  The problem is that if you have anything that you would like to refrigerate, you cannot.  As soon as you so much move a can or bottle, it gets charged to the room.  I managed to squash a 16oz bottle of water in there.  That action triggered a purchase  charge which they removed.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Really cool lobby and welcome area. Staff was OVER THE TOP kind and accommodating. The rooftop bar was unbelievable! The views were stunning we arrived  late from an overseas flight, and it was so nice to relax on the rooftop with a cocktail. The rooms are super industrial but also cozycomfortable. The bed was SOOO comfy! The views from the room were incredible. They have a cute little coffee pastry bar set up in the morning and I enjoyed mine on the 10th floor observation deck! We did not eat in the restaurant but it looked nice. 1010 recommend  Stayed here as a Base for my US open trip for three nights. Just needed a place to stay the night, near the train station while I was the us open all day. Check in went well and no issues the first night. Left early the second day and came back late second night. I noticed it was significantly hot in my room when I arrived. Room 1104 for reference. It was a very hot summer humid day that day in the  high of 90s. I thought someone just changed my thermostat while I was away. I tried to change the AC around but noticed it never went below room temp of 86 degrees. I was exhausted and fell asleep, But woke up a few times due to the heat. Finally in the morning I went to the front desk to inquire. The person in the front desk told me they had issues with the AC on that floor all day. Nobody can tell me why I was not informed or was given another room that was actually working. So I had to leave and spend another day at the us open but the staff told me they will reach out and let me know if its fixed or I will get another room. By 7pm, nobody calls me so I called them to see what happened. The person working the front desk at the time was not updated or informed what my problem was. He did say he will leave a note and he didnt know if the ac was fixed. At least this night was a lot cooler after a round of thunderstorms. I get to the hotel and the ac is not fixed. Its a new lady working the front desk, I mentioned a few times I did not want to be frustrated with her since she just started working but communication to me or their staff members were almost nonexistent. This was almost past midnight so I declined a new room because I still needed to pack and leave less than eight hours from then. The only up side was that it was colder outside so it was not as bad as night before with the window open. Very frustrating with my stay there, i literally just wanted a comfortable place to sleep and recharge. I will be looking for another hotel and never coming back here. I travelled to New York for the first time with my wife and stayed at the Boro.  We highly recommend this hotel.

We had originally been a bit skeptical because the hotel is not located in Manhattan, but this really wasn't an issue at all. The hotel is within walking distance of two subway stations, both of which service Manhattan. The Queensboro Plaza station was particularly useful as it had multiple services, including one which stopped at Time Square and further downtown.  We found it nice to come back to a quiet place to sleep.

We stayed in a King Manhattan view room with a balcony which was spacious, modern and clean.

The staff were fantastic, particularly with suggesting places to see and various areas to eat and drink both around the hotel and around the city.

The price was reasonable by New York standards.

Overall, we would stay here again.  The location might not seem ideal but should not be a deterent, particularly for travellers like us who would spend the entire day and night sightseeing and visiting the city's bars and restaurants. I stayed for one night. The woman at check in was friendly and helpful. It doesnt have its own parking lot, so I had to park a few blocks away in a garage. The room was decent in appearance, but didnt have a refrigerator, a coffeemaker, or a stand for my luggage. The bed wasnt at all comfortable, but the shower pressure was great. The coffee in the lobby was good. It would have been nice to sit on the roof, but it was locked. The wooden floors are great!
The shower pressure is wonderful.
The lady at the front desk during morning hours is FAR from welcoming.
David, at night, was nicer.
The hotel is tidy but I dont think our room was properly attended to.
 there was hair and a drink stain on the sheet.
 a used qtip fell out of the towels when we first picked them up in the bathroom.
 the complimentary mini, lotion bottle was open and used.
The team was very accommodating in getting us extra towels and sheets.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The staff provided us with a coupon for breakfast and some free amenities and water bottles. The place was very clean, the room was large and comfortable. Staff let us access our room an hour early since we were absolutely exhausted because of the heatwave, which we really appreciated. We had an issue with the temperature inside the room which was freezing cold, and staff came to help us right away and provided us with blankets for the night. If we ever come back to New York, well make sure to book this hotel again! Excellent!

Complimentary coffee and pastry each morning on 2nd floor. Rooms are clean, spacious and with private bath. Our view wasn't great, but the pigeons lined up on the sills at night and gave the place added charm. We had a great stay here in July. The hotel is outdated,  which justifies the price.  It has everything you need. Rooms are clean. It's quite at night. It's conveniently located steps to Penn station and main attractions.  Very friendly staff,  they have complimentary coffee and tea and cookies as well as bottles of water. Beautiful hotel. The staff here have been amazing. The bar is great too. When I come back to New York City I will definitely stay here again. The room was super clean. Stanford Hotel was phenomenal. Excellent staff, clean quiet rooms.

The Ridge Hotel,"151 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002, USA",3.9,40.722867,-73.9894017,"I would rate The Ridge Hotel as average. One night cost me about 200, which might seem a bit much, but considering it's in Manhattan, the price is standard. You simply won't find the same quality for a better price. The positives of the hotel definitely include the staff, who were very friendly and helpful. Additionally, the cleanliness and amenities of the hotel are commendable. The room has everything you need, from towels and toiletries to a coffee maker and a safe. You can make complimentary coffee and grab a snack in the lobby. On the seventh floor, there is a beautiful terrace with an amazing view. Truly wonderful. Another positive aspect is the hotel's great location, right next to the subway, making it very easy to get anywhere you need.

As for the negatives, the hotel is located on a busy street in Manhattan, so you can hear street noise all night, especially on the lower floors. You can also hear other guests slamming doors. I have neutral feelings about the bed the mattress was quite soft, which I personally liked, but others might find it problematic. Overall, I would say that The Ridge Hotel is a solid choice in New York, where you get real value for your money. I really appreciate the staff for their helpfulness and for maintaining the hotel in a clean, modern style. I would definitely like to return in the future but would request a room on a higher floor to avoid street noise. The hotel has a beautiful rooftop. Its the most fully automated checkin hotel Ive experiencedyoure required to register online before arrival to receive your entry code and stay details. While they do have front desk staff, they dont seem to handle checkins directly. If you arrive late without registering online, you may run into some issues since the front desk isnt staffed 247.

The rooms are small but come with a fridge and microwave, facing a view of the East Village. The TV isnt able to stream, so its more of a classic movie night experience with limited options. However, the real highlight is the rooftop, where you can get a distant view of the Empire State Building. The flooring is made of old wooden plankssomewhat decayed, creaky underfoot, and adding a unique charm. That said, be cautious with kids my child was playing with a toy car on the floor and accidentally got scratched by an exposed nail from the old wood, leaving a mark that lasted about a week.

The first floor has 24hour Kcup coffee available, and the hotel is close to iconic spots like Katzs Deli and Russ  Daughters. But what I enjoyed the most was the rooftopit adds a lot of value to the overall experience, making this a very costeffective hotel choice. great little hotel in an awesome location. It's honestly like a glorified, individual room hostel. Basic amenities, a clean small room and somewhere safe to lay your head. You get what you pay for, mattress was subpar but everything was clean, nice hall decor. Stayed here one night, front desk staff was there when I checked in at 3pm and gone probably by 8pm but the number to get in touch with someone has a fast response time. Didn't check out the roof top but would have liked to. Hotel is in a great area  close to subways. Nice but wouldn't stay here long term, no more than a few nights I had a wonderful stay at this hotel! The location is unbeatable, right in the heart of New York City, making it easy to explore all the major attractions. The room was clean, spacious, and wellmaintained, providing a comfortable and relaxing environment after a day of sightseeing.
The staff were friendly and helpful, always ready to assist with any questions or requests. The checkin and checkout process was smooth and efficient. Highly recommended!!!!! Rooms are small, clean and it has almost everything. Location is very good, close to subway and many restaurants. In the basement they have a good social area and in the roof they have another social area. It is more like an Airbnb. No pool, no restaurant, no lobby. Free coffee","Monday: Open 24 hours

New York Hilton Midtown,"1335 6th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.1,40.7622481,-73.97919,"The location is great. I liked it was close to the theatre district and all the perks New York City has to offer. The staff were kind and professional. The room was comfortable and clean. I had a very pleasant stay and the staff was so respectful to my elderly Mom. That leads me to recommend this hotel. Loved this hotel. Very busy at reception at times,so maybe another employee or two to deal with check incheck out.
Very clean room and all the staff are very friendly and lovely. However 2 employees made my time great here. Robert E is calmness personified and also very professional when dealing with everyone waiting for a table for breakfast and also Warren our server for breakfast. Both are a credit to the hotel and i would like to nominate them for special recognition for being so good at their jobs. Great hotel, location is close to everything in midtown, we walked everywhere....69 miles in 6 days.
I need to mention 'Robert E' and his team at Herb n' Kitchen. Nothing was ever a problem, they were always really friendly and helpful. We had the American Buffet breakfast every morning, fresh waffles cooked to order by the chef. I'd recommend the breakfast as it sets you up for the day.
Great staff throughout the hotel. Room 1938, 2 night stay. Would not recommend! Hotel is very dated. Hallways had wallpaper peeling and overall rundown  gross looking. Our room smelled musty and just didnt feel clean.  I wouldve asked for a different room but I suspect all rooms are this way and based on check in experience, I didnt want to interact with staff again.  Duvet had a hole in it.  Check in staffexperience left a lot to be desired.  Housekeeping was very friendly and accommodating. Location is the only thing this hotel has going for it.  Will go back to booking at a Marriott for our next trip to NYC. The hotel location was the best. Easy accessible to so many places within walking distance and the subway was close as well.
I would highly recommend to anyone. The room we had had double beds, and although it was on the small side, the beds were super comfy and the room was clean.
A big thumbs up to Udi S in the Lobby Lounge. Very respectful, yet with enough charisma to enjoy the nightly martini.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hotel Riu Plaza New York Times Square,"305 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.4,40.7601952,-73.9881342,"An excellent hotel, very well situated near Broadway. I stayed for 10 nights and I was well looked after throughout. The room was comfy and well kept by housekeeping, with a great view over the Richard Rogers excellent as a Hamilton fan!. The reception staff were helpful and friendly, and the bar was also a comfy quiet place to visit after a long day exploring the city. The coffee shop attached also has good quality lunch food and coffee. There is a well kept and equipped gym downstairs. Crucially, the air conditioning is very good, essential in the summer! I would recommend this hotel for anybody looking for a comfortable stay in the heart of midtown. The best hotel I have been to in New York. I give it a 10 out of 10 for everything. The cleanliness of the hotel in general, the attention of all the staff, the super nice, modern and clean rooms and incredible views. I was on the 21st floor and we loved it, they clean them and put on new clothes every day. The most complete buffet breakfast I have ever seen and all the waitresses are lovely. Not to mention the best location they have, Time Square is just one block away, meaning a 1 minute walk. And best of all, when we arrived it was 9 am and they already had rooms available and from that time they lovingly located us. Check out is at 12 on the day you are leaving and they have the option that you can pay 20 an hour if you want to stay a little longer like us since our flight leaves at 7 pm and we decided to stay until 3 pm and we paid an extra 60 which seems great to us so we don't have to be walking around with children and suitcases in the street. I hope you continue like this. For our part, whenever we return, we will come here. Echo already has a reservation to return, God willing, in November. We will see each other again. Keep up the efficient . Wonderful service, beautiful building, clean rooms. Overall extremely happy with this hotel and I would definitely return. The breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts Ive had. They gave us a top floor room with an amazing view. The elevator was fast, nice location, a block or two to all the action with lots of restaurants nearby. Currently staying here but have not had housekeeping for the last 2 days. Yesterday we were out all day but no housekeeping.  Today we asked 3x for housekeeping and left the correct sign requesting housekeeping but still no housekeeping. I had to call for towels and toilet paper and soap in the bathroom.  I called front desk and they are condescending and said I probably put the wrong sign out and they have 600 plus rooms so it's impossible for housekeeping to get to all rooms.  Front desk also told me I should've asked for a specific time to have my room cleaned. I've never stayed in a hotel where getting housekeeping service is so difficult.  I would not recommend staying here. There a lot of other much better choices to stay at. I will not be back here. The rooms are small especially for families , but very clean . They took good advantage of space in the room .
Fantastic location.
The daily included  breakfast was very good with many options . I didnt like the facility fees , 100 that was not included in the price when I booked through hotel website, this should have been disclosed!!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Residence Inn New York Manhattan/Times Square,"1033 6th Ave, New York, NY 10018, USA",4.2,40.752806,-73.9858472,"We chose this location because its in the heart of Manhattan. Its within walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Madison Square Garden and all the Spectacles, theaters and vibes of Times Square. Free breakfast is plentiful but just typical hotel food. Bar lounge is a little dated and has limited selection. Overall the building could use some upgrades but its clean, spacious, convenient and comfortable. I stayed at this hotel during the week of July 4th. I was traveling with my mom and daughter, and we all enjoyed our stay.  Checkin was super easy. We had a corner room with a view of Bryant Park, a kingsize bed with a sofa bed, and a full kitchen. The room was clean, and housekeeping did an excellent job of tidying up the room each day. AC kept the room cool and comfortable. The hot buffetstyle breakfast was delicious! They offer a wide selection of breakfast options and quickly refill any item that runs low. The staff were very friendly and greeted us each time we entered or left the hotel. The location is great also. We were within walking distance of mostly everything we wanted to do. I would definitely stay here again! Location is perfect. Dated hotel, but clean and functional. The TEAM at this hotel is spectacular. Special shout out to Sergio at the front desk. Made our stay awesome. Thank you. Also would like to recognize Marina who kept our room in tip top shape. She was super nice and very accommodating. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again. Breakfast is delicious and plentiful, but very busy around 830am on. Laundry facility was nice to have and has brand new equipment. Gym was nice also. Look no further, book your room now. Residence Inn by Marriott is a topnotch choice for both short and extended stays. The excellent staff stands out, consistently going above and beyond to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable experience. The rooms are spacious, wellappointed, and perfect for longer stays with their partially equipped kitchens. The complimentary breakfast offers a great variety of options to start your day. Conveniently located with easy access to local attractions, Residence Inn by Marriott provides a welcoming and homelike atmosphere that makes you want to return. My husband, son,and I stayed for 3 nights and loved our stay! Checkin was super easy.  They even let us check in early.  The day we checked out, they held our bags for us so we could go out for the day without carrying our luggage around.  All the staff was very nice and helpful.  Elevators are busy and packed during breakfast hours, but it didn't really bother us because we already expected to have to wait.  Tip, though! If you're on one of the higher floors and the elevator is going up, jump on because it won't take long for it to go back down, and you might end up waiting forever for another elevator and when it comes it may be to full to get on. Centrally located to everything, and the subway entrance is right across the street. Overall, we had a pleasant experience and would definitely stay again!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Theres also a rooftop bar with a stunning view of 5th ave and a part of central park! Theres also a pool with views of central park. The housekeeping is extremely friendly and leave no spots! Youll see many business people there but its very kid friendly. The location is perfect  just a few blocks from central park! Fifth travel to NYC, first experience with the Peninsula, and loved everything. Staffs were so welcoming and helpful, and I really LOVED our room, especially bed  usually cannot sleep well even in 5star hotels but I felt like much more comfortable than any others.

Also lovely walking distance to central park, MoMA, and some other major tourist attractions. Breakfast was also nice, both inroom and Clement.

Definitely recommend this hotel, and will return for my next NYC travel. It is an amazing hotel with superb accommodations.  In New York City at 55th and 5th. Close to everything! A recent renovation has created luxury rooms and baths. Breakfast and the waitstaff are topnotch. Highly recommend! I had one of the best massages of my life here! The masseuse was quite pleasant and the aromas as well as the process were all so memorable. Would 1010 come again! 29 for a cup of water, waterdown amaretto and a plate of nuts and of course tip it was a but rushy to order and i didnt like the drink didnt use the rooms","Monday: Open 24 hours

The Flat NYC - Hotel & Event Space New York,"25 W 24th St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.2,40.743083,-73.9906522,"The location is probably the best thing about this hotel. The staff are consistently unhelpful and are super young, socially awkward, and inexperienced. Theyre not there to provide a service, just fill a position and do the least as possible. There is no elevator and the staff dont help with bags. The furniture in the rooms is pretty crappy. The room I had had no window at all. My room was on the second floor and near the bar so I could hear loud music past 11pm. Not as advertised! Buyer beware! Room was advertised as a queen suite, with an in room sink, and a tub in the bathroom. It had NEITHER of these things. As i have a chronic back problem, the tub is key for relaxing after a long day. At least it was clean and the bed was comfortable. Staff was very nice, but that doesn't make it worth the price. The location is perfect, i walked home from the club in the middle of the night and felt safe because it was literally a 4 minutes walk. The room was beautiful, clean and very nice, and the shared bathrooms too. Of course they don't have hotelstyle services, but they offer free water bottles and teacoffee dispensers, as well as clean towels. The best place if you are a traveler or a couple on a budget, not willing to sacrifice your safety and privacy, as you only share the bathroom but not the room. Visited NYC from 2nd6th September 2023 staying at the very central and convenient The Flat NYC.

The big perks is the hotel's central location around the corner from the iconic Flatiron Building and closeby to middle Manhattan attractions including the Empire State Building and The High Line. The 23 St MTA Subway station is primarily serviced by the R  W Yellow lines where it is a short ride to Times Square and Central Park northbound and Lower Manhattan, the Financial District and Brooklyn southbound. N  Q line trains operate at late nights and on weekends.

The rooms while a bit small are very serviceable for a major city hotel and come complete with a small vanity sink and a desk. Toilet and shower access is shared and located directly across the hall but this is not a major issue for me. The airconditioning system is a bit loud but provides very comfortable relief during humid or hot days in the city which was frequent when I visited.

The staff at the front desk were very friendly and gave plenty of tips and recommendations to help me enjoy and take in New York City. Nearby one can find iconic New Yorkstyle pizza from Andiamo Pizza, roast duck and juicy pork soup dumplings from Dim Sum Sam, Australianstyle coffee and breakfast offerings from Bluestone Lane and many other restaurants, diners and fast food offerings in the area.

The Flat NYC is a very good choice for accommodation in Manhattan and close to all major sights and amenities. Great property for what it is. I stayed in the room with no bathroom and that was OK with me to share a bathroom with shower. Some people may not want that. They do have rooms with a small bathroom and shower, but I can't comment on those rooms. Staff was friendly and helpful. They also had bottled water, coffee, and a selection of teas for the guest. Price point and location are great.  I would definitely stay the again on my next trip to Manhattan.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Courtyard New York Manhattan/Times Square,"114 W 40th St, New York, NY 10018, USA",4.1,40.753502,-73.9862678,"Review of Courtyard Times Square, New York

My stay at the Courtyard Times Square in New York was disappointing, to say the least. While its location is undeniably a major perk just one street away from Times Square and making it very convenient for travel around the city. The negatives far outweighed the positives.

First, the area surrounding the hotel was unpleasant, with many loiterers outside and a constant bad smell near the building. Once inside, things didnt improve much. The hotel feels old and in need of a serious refresh. Everything seemed dated and lacked the modern amenities youd expect for the price. Speaking of which, the hotel is overpriced for what it offers, with hidden fees that add up quickly, making it feel like poor value.

The elevator situation was another frustration long waits were a regular occurrence, which just added to the overall inconvenience of my stay. All these factors combined really put a damper on my trip to New York. I wouldnt recommend this hotel unless the location is your top priority and you can overlook the rest. Stayed here last week for 4 nights, and the staff, Rosario and Fernando in particular, we're amazing.

I had initially booked another hotel nearby,but because of an error they cancelled my booking,I had nowhere to stay.I was panicking and stressed.

Then I arrived here,and Rosario and Fernando went above and beyond to help me get a room and were amazing.They calmed me down and because of them,I had a great stay in NYC! I will always be thankful for them.

The room itself was also nice enough,had a very comfy bed,and a pleasant stay, and if or when I visit New York again,I would definitely stay here again.

Thank you so much! WOW! Couldnt recommend this hotel more. Miguel was so helpful and all staff is warm and welcoming. We checked in at 7 in the morning after an awful overnight red eye and thought there was no way wed be able to check in, but Miguel got us right into our room. Hotel is clean and cool crisp temperature. 1010! The location was perfect! Right next to Times Square. There was some comments posted previously about homeless people thats EXPECTED in NYC so theres no reason that should reflect the hotel it self! The rooms were very clean and parking around the corner was convenient. Crystal was AMAZING! She was accommodating, helpful and her hospitality made our stay there my favorite part. One of the worst hotels I have stayed in NYC. Our room smells stale and like Mildew.  Paint is peeling off the doors, carpet is frayed. Everything looks worn and old. not impressed at all. For what I am paying I can stay at a much better hotel. I feel like I am at a motel. I am here right now, the smell is so bad.

"Blue Angel Hotel NYC, Ascend Hotel Collection","152 E 55th St, New York, NY 10022, USA",4.3,40.759124,-73.9693307,"Super friendly and hospitable receptionists who clearly explained the hotel amenities and provided a printed list of restaurants and life essentials nearby. Clean and small room, looks a bit old but not a big problem. Decent water pressure. Great location in midtown, with a few steps to the public transit. Overall its a pleasant stay, great value for the price. My partner and I were beyond impressed with our onenight stay, and you probably won't find anything better at this price and location.

Overall 55. Outstanding staff  hospitality, great value for the price.

Rooms 45. Very clean, cozy, and impressively quiet room despite location in Midtown. We felt comfortable and slept very well. Room was on the small side but not unreasonable given the location. The only drawback is the carpeted floor, if you're like me and dislike carpeting.

Service 55. All the staff we interacted with were exceptionally kind and helpful, especially Mara, who facilitated our arrival and accommodated our lastminute request to move our checkin time.

Location 55. Midtown NYC  walkable to MoynihanPenn station, Central Park, not to mention plenty of subway stops, restaurants, and museums. Upon arrival Mara gave us a printed list of restaurants, shopping, and other essentials nearby. We arrived in NY too early for checkin and the hostess was great. She took our luggage and said the room should be ready in a couple of hours. When we came back, checkin was seamless, they gave us a full sheet of restaurant recommendations, and let us know that everything in the minifridge was included with our stay. Housekeeping was wonderful and the rooms were very clean. I was pleasantly surprised to see only a couple of rooms per floor. A very quiet stay and within walking distance to everything we wanted to do, including the subway. Would 1010 stay here again. If youre looking for a clean and quiet hotel room this is your place. The front desk staff were so kind and helpful. The room is small and cozy. The bed and bed sheets were comfortable and I had a great night sleep. The shower had strong water pressure. For the price point I paid, this place is outstanding. I enjoyed my stay at the Blue Angel hotel. All of the employees that I interacted with were professional and friendly. My room was larger than I expected, everything worked including AC  elevators, bed was comfortable and hotel was relatively quiet. Only issue I had was the very weak lighting in the bathroom, 2 lights but mirror area was dark. Hotel was in a great location a few blocks from 5th ave, a lot of food options nearby, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, St. Patricks Cathedral, and Subway stop all just 510 mins away.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Newark Airport,"128 Frontage Rd, Newark, NJ 07114, USA",3.7,40.7128433,-74.1642943,"The location of the hotel is decent  though it felt a bit isolated with limited dining options nearby, it is conveniently close to the airport and just 15 minutes by taxi from the Newark PATH train station. The PATH offers a direct connection to the World Trade Center station in New York, taking approximately 40 minutes.

The hotel has a restaurant with great staff working there  approachable and friendly. The food was delicious, beautifully presented, and very tasty. I personally recommend the Buffalo chicken wings and the Boom Boom shrimp.

The checkin process was a bit problematic. Although I checked in at the reception desk, there seemed to be an issue, as my reservation didnt appear in the hotels system when I tried to charge a restaurant bill to my room. There is an option to check in using the Hilton app, but I didnt try it this time  something Ill consider for the future.

The room itself was clean and spacious, with a large, comfortable bed. However, when I booked the room, I selected the New York City skyline view option, and while I did have a view of the sky, it was more of Newark than New York. Additionally, much of the view was on railway tracks. My expectations were a bit different.

Overall, the stay was good, and I plan to return here in the future. I wish I was leaving a nicer review but here it goes.

My husband and I made a reservation to stay at this hotel for the two days we were going to be in NJ for a friend's wedding. We made the reservation 23 days prior to our stay via a third party app. We had an early flight and arrived at about 9am, to which we were told we had to wait because checkin wasn't until 3 or 4pm, which was understandable.

After about 3 hours, our friend came to meet us at the hotel since him and my husband needed to run some errands and my husband goes to the front desk to see if there was anything that could be done about getting a room sooner, especially since it was a little after check out and there may have been some rooms available. I'm standing on the side of the front desk with our friend talking, while my husband is speaking to the woman at the front and I hear her say that there aren't any rooms available. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt but there was something off about that.

I stepped in and asked what was going on and again she mentioned that there were no rooms available. I was truly dumbfounded and my face said it all. We had so much on our minds and so much to do, we just ended up leaving and didn't end up speaking to a manager.

Now fast forward almost 2 weeks later and we're still trying to work out a dispute to get our money back with our third party booker. Now the reps on our case are stating that the staff at the hotel are telling them that on that day they were never sold out of rooms and then a lie about how we booked the reservation the same day as the stay. It's absolutely disgusting the treatment and the lies that are being told and the fact that they are not releasing our money to us.

My husband and I have called over and over again, have spoken to about 34 different managers and have gotten nowhere with these people.

My only regret was not speaking with a manager at the same moment we were told that there were no rooms available. Never again! Although the hotel could use some updates, I was very impressed with the service.  I went downstairs at 4 am to do some work online since my sister was still asleep.  The coffee shop was not available until 630.  But one of the managers took time out from what he was doing to provide some coffee and hot water for tea for me, and that really made my day!  Thanks Sam! I was at this hotel for a business event. So I didnt stay in the rooms, but the conference room was very nice. The chairs were comfortable they supplied water. The caf made a great latte. The food looked good, even though I didnt have any. I only stayed here because I didnt know betterhad an airline voucher. The lobby is fresh looking and the gym pretty good for an airport hotel. The rooms need a refresh, my bathroom door was falling apart. Would not recommend the restaurant  food was mediocre at best and they are understaffed, which isnt the staffs fault so I wont comment on service.

But the worst would be the atrium setup. If you must stay here, ask for a nonatrium room. They play music in the lobbyrestaurant until midnight and the noise from people just echoes into your room. When I tried to contact the front desk via text, using info from the QR code in the room, I was actually speaking to a different hotel. After messaging through the app to complain, no one responded. The noise then starts again before 7am when everyone is awake and downstairs.

The nicest thing I can say is the bed was comfortable  thats all I really needed. I went straight back to the airport earlier than necessary to get out of there.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hotel on Rivington,"107 Rivington St, New York, NY 10002, USA",4,40.7198981,-73.9880242,"Friend and I came here for a few days and it was really nice. The room was just fine with an amazing view of the NYC skyline, and theres a lot to do within a 1 or 2mile radius. There was only one working elevator which was a bit of a hassle but it wasnt too bad. Unfortunately during our stay the restaurant was closed so cant say for sure if its good or not. Great location, spacious room and nice views. Reception area was nice, and the staff very attentive.

On the flip side
 only 1 out of 2 elevator was working, hence 10 min wait time was typical
 rooms could definitely use an update. Bathroom window would not lock, bathroom tiling seems decades old, and furniture would benefit from being refinished.
 TV connection was not working well, with picture constantly freezing.

Overall, we are likely to explore other hotels in the city. I have stayed at Hotel on Rivington 5 times now in my travels to New York and its the best service Ive ever received. The staff is always friendly and super accommodating. They had been going through a remodel for a few of my stays but they kept certain floors blocked off to help with the noise of the construction. If youre looking for an affordable, comfortable, clean room with friendly staff this is the spot. Its located on the LES and is walking distance to so many amazing restaurants and bars. The only thing I will say is the furniture is a little older in some rooms but the beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean. Highly recommend giving them a try! Just spent a long weekend at the Hotel on Rivington and was so pleased with our stay. The staff was delightful and so pleasant, going above and beyond to help. We arrived early our first day and they checked our bags while we went out to explore. The hotel offers complimentary coffee and tea in the morning and wine in the evenings such a nice touch.

The hotel lobby and restaurant are beautiful and a nice respite from the bustling LES scene. We didn't eat at the restaurant or enjoy the bar, but it's nice to have both inside your hotel should you want to take advantage.

We had a corner room with wrap around windows the room was HUGE by NYC standards and newly updated. The bed was super comfy, sheets supple and pillows comfy. Some reviewers commented on the noise. Yes there is noise and it gets hoping on the weekend, but be reminded you are staying at one of the most happening areas on the Lower East Side so of course there's going to be noise. Just download the White Noise app and play it off your phone at night you won't hear a thing. Great views, comfortable beds, clean, needs some repairs. Windows don't lock, balcony door doesn't lock, bottom of bathroom door has water damage. Disappointed no coffee maker in room. Poor television reception. Unable to make any cell phone calls. Front desk staff very friendly. Enjoyed stay.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
"The Beekman, A Thompson Hotel, by Hyatt","123 Nassau St, New York, NY 10038, USA",4.6,40.7112134,-74.0069041,"The hotel was absolutely amazing. We came with our dog, and he was greeted with lots of petting and attention. He even got a dog treat from Barry, who did a great job of welcoming us from the moment we parked and entered the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is not just a place to stay overnight, but an experience on its own. Had a fantastic experience during a one night stay in the city while passing through. Utilized the valet service, which was quicker than quoted upon departure. The room was spotless and perfectly appointed with everything you could need. The AC worked well to keep the room cool during the heat of the summer. I couldn't get enough of the signature scent that's in the soaps and shower gels. I wish I could have brought it home with me. Overall, this was a fantastic, unique 5star experience for a quick overnight passing through. The jazz bar in the basement was a fantastic surprise. This hotel was full 5 stars. Myself and my partner could not fault this hotel from start to finish. We stayed 3 nights, the hotel was beautiful, unique and welcoming, it was clean and the staff provided a friendly and efficient service. The interior was so nice and different and my partner loved the decor and vibe. The live music and bar and restaurant areas were beautiful. Dan at front desk was super friendly and Barry the doorman amongst everyone else. The hotel is also close to so many things, we didn't get to stay long enough but when we return to NY we will 100 stay at this hotel again. You did great in every way, we couldn't fault anything, thanks for having us and definitely a solid 5 star hotel in comparison to others who brand themselves ""5 star"". Sincerely  Debbie The staff is awesome, made you feel very welcomed and relaxed! Barry, thanks for the personal touch and treats for the dog! Beautiful hotel from the 1880s, tastefully designed restaurant and bar. Moving my son to NYU. Hotel was beautiful, The ambience was wonderful. Staff was great however I was charging 99 for car service and complementary coffee. I never use the car service didnt even know they had it and the one day I went to get complementary coffee they were out of cups. This is unacceptable I should not be charged for service. I didnt even get to use. Overall wonderful hotel.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Pendry Manhattan West,"438 W 33rd St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.8,40.7532122,-73.9984291,"This is a boutique hotel chain that serves highend clientele.   So this means that the rooms are well appointed and decorated, but small.   And everything we expected was true.   The hotel is relatively new so the decorations and designs are very contemporary and modern.   The color scheme is dark with light colored wood accents. Overall, a nice place to stay.   It is in the Hudson Yard area so it has all the offerings that are near.   Many good restaurants, attractions, and shopping. Deeply disappointing experience at The Pendry Hotel! I booked a room block at this hotel for about 60 people for one week in August. The issues I faced were significant and ongoing

Delayed and ErrorFilled Billing The billing process was a nightmare. After a month of persistent backandforth, the hotel still failed to provide an accurate bill. Despite the errors being primarily their fault, the staff's response was unhelpful and rude. At one point, they insisted they wouldn't address any further issues until I escalated the matter to the General Manager.

Unprofessional Staff The staff exhibited a high level of unprofessionalism throughout. The initial sales contact I dealt with provided inaccurate information and then abruptly left the hotel.

Poor Customer Service The rudeness and lack of accountability from the hotel staff only compounded the problem. Its clear that they lack the necessary customer service skills to handle such issues effectively.

Taking the time to send correct billing in a timely manner is the least that can be done. When there are discrepancies, it is important to explain your position thoroughly instead of dismissing the payee's concerns. After spending over 150K, I would expect better behavior and professional customer service at best!

Based on my experience, I would strongly advise against booking  with this hotel. The ongoing billing problems, combined with the unprofessional behavior and poor service, make it not worth the hassle. I stayed here in January 2023 for a short staycation in the city as the rate was cheaper than normal as the holiday crowds had started dying down at this point. The pictures online do not do justice to the place and I am quite happy that I splurged to check this place out in person. I do like the understated quiet luxury aesthetic that the Pendry brand is known for and especially like that it does not try too hard to be too quiet luxury if that makes sense. The rooms are large and tastefully designed and the staff is hospitable but not plastic. I used to live nearby and 37th and 10th so I was familiar with the neighborhood for the most part but had not visited the Manhattan West restaurantsshops as I had moved out shortly after the Whole Foods had opened up in 2020.

I was working in the Midtown East area at the time and would walk over to Whole Foods every morning during my stay at the hotel to grab a quick breakfast and then take my Uber to the office. I did not get a chance to visit Zou Zous during my visit but did visit the lobby bar  the cocktails are great. I visited Whole Foods multiple times and stocked up my favorite Saratoga Springs sparkling water multiple times during my stay. I visited Ci Siamo nearby the food was excellent. While I am not a huge fan of NYC at the moment, I do have fond memories of this staycation this is currently my favorite hotel in NYC. I would highly recommend that you consider booking a stay at this hotel if you are visiting the city. I havent had the chance to stay overnight, so I cant comment on the rooms, but the Pendry Lobby Bar is a delight. The art deco ambiance is luxurious, complete with a cozy gas fireplace. Their bespoke cocktails and delicious bites truly stand out. Reluctantly, Im sharing this glowing reviewhoping it doesnt become too popular and spoil my favorite cocktail bar! If your're looking for a very modern, clean, minimalistic upscale hotel with a manhattan closeup skyline view out of the movies  then book this hotel. Absolutely amazing rooms i had the corner suite. Topnotch equipment and furniture. TVs have chrome cast. Good internet without registration wall. Very good breakfast I recommend getting it as inroom service to enjoy the view meanwhile. Superbe Gym everything newest technogym equipment, high ceilings, nice view. All in all just amazing. Highly recommended.
Be careful not to lift the alcoholic beverages for more than 60 seconds, otherwise you might end up paying 144 bucks for a McCallan you didn't even enjoy.

Hilton Garden Inn Times Square,"790 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.1,40.7612054,-73.9865068,"Right at the Heart of the City!

This is a centrallylocated hotel right in the middle of the busy city of New York!

The costs are justifiable based on the quality of the hotel. Also, the subway is right around the corner, which can take you to various parts of New York at low fares is it 2.70?.

The lobby area is beautifully designed with an artistic touch and great for photos!

I cant remember if they charged breakfast separately!

Also, there are so many pocketfriendly restaurants right outsideopposite the hotel. And, a liqor store right ahead ! Several days after leaving the hotel, additional charges were put onto our credit card for items missing from the room. We were not advised of these charges and, in fact, we took nothing. The charges were in error. We contacted the hotel several times and they will not respond and so haven't yet reversed their error. Terrible service to hit the credit card, not say anything, and then not respond. Very happy with the service. Clean, kind, knowledgeable and always brought me items when I requested them.  The concierge is always willing to assist, theres security at the doors.  Parking available  use the park and pay package with the room.  A small breakfast kiosk on site as well. Easily accessible to the metro and many eating locations.  I was happy with the stay for the price.
The room is a 3.5 quality room. Small but cozy.  The beds are acceptable and the room is clean.  The bedding is clean but not the best quality. I suspect its over starched? I bring my own sheets anywhere I go anyways.   The windows do open but our side didnt have screening duo to exterior work being done and they need access to the scaffolding.  The curtains block out all the exterior light and the windows are thick and block out 80 of the street noise. But it is New York and a busy place. Great first time experience visiting the city.  The parking garage next door made it hassle free to find a place to park, and the staff at both the hotel and garage were awesome.  Very friendly and helpful!  The room was nice, and we really didn't hear much noise from the street, just the occasional fire engine.  I know some may consider the hotel dated, but they are currently working on renovations. Everything worked in our room including the microwave, mini fridge, and TV.  Most importantly the room was clean and the mattress wasn't worn out. The hotel location is close to many attractions which is perfect if you're on a budget and don't mind walking.  Would definitely stay here again! Weve stayed at this property many times throughout the years. The location is excellent for what we like to do in NYC. Theater, etc. The parking next door is convenient and reasonable, especially this time, as it was combined with our room rate. The rooms are spacious enough, but pretty tired. The hallways are dark. I requested a new shower curtain, as the original one smelled damp and moldy. That was replaced immediately. Ive had the shower curtain replaced at this property before at previous stays as well. All was very adequate until late last night I encountered a huge cockroach on the floor in the bathroom under the sink. My husband trapped it under a cup and then we placed the wastebasket on top of it. It was past midnight and we didnt want to call the front desk. By the way, the phone in the room did not work.  When checking out this morning we mentioned the bug encounter and were chastised for not having reported it last night. The checkout clerk was totally unfriendly and not sympathetic. No customer service. We were not offered anything for the unpleasant encounter. This was in contrast to the lovely bell staff who have been there for the many years that we have been coming to this property.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Glasses of Champagne when we arrived for our anniversary, turndown service each night with sweets and water for the evening or next day, and super helpfulfriendly front desk shout out to Kiwi Maria. The location is wonderful as it is close to Central Park and museums. The bar here is also great and energetic with yummy cocktails and food. The doormen and housekeeping were perfect. In other words impeccable. I feel this place is very old and dated. It's a beautiful hotel. It definitely needs some sprucing up the room services. Disgusting food is terrible here. Only had breakfast from outside, did not stay in the hotel. This is really upscale clean neat hotel in Upper East side. I really like the restaurant service and attention to detail. This is a review for the bar. Although Ive recommended the hotel to out of town friends because its so special. They are on point with all details and its absolutely stunning. Fun crowd in the main and restaurant bar, great service and fun ambiance. The hotel has bikes out front a cart to Bergdorfs. Ive had dinner here before and both experiences were stellar.

Hotel Riu Plaza Manhattan Times Square,"145 W 47th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.6,40.7589022,-73.9836073,"I had a fantastic stay at Riu Plaza Manhattan. The location is excellent, making it easy to access many attractions in the city. The cleanliness of the hotel was topnotch, and everything felt very wellmaintained.

Although there was a bit of a queue for breakfast, the wait time wasnt too long, and it moved fairly quickly. Once seated, the breakfast was worth the waitthe food was excellent, with a great variety of options.

What really stood out to me was the staff. They were professional, friendly, and always ready to assist, making my stay all the more enjoyable. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and Id highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Manhattan. We stayed at the Riu for 4 nights. For us, the hotel is overhyped. The location is very good, and the hotel itself is really beautiful. However, it is extremely crowded and overrun with people. Every day, you have to stand in line for at least 30 minutes for breakfast. This really bothered us. If you go to breakfast at 9 a.m. and have to wait 30 minutes, you only have 30 minutes left to eat. At 950 a.m., the staff makes an announcement that the buffet will close promptly at 10 a.m.

The rooms are small and modernly furnished. The bathroom is also small. We didnt miss anything, except for a bit more space. The beds are built slightly higher so that you can store your suitcases under the bed. That was a smart solution.

Despite this, our stay was pleasant, and we were able to enjoy our vacation. Hotel was absolutely lovely. Rooms were immaculate. Breakfast was beautiful, so much choice and the staff there were spot on, friendly and all the ball with all of the tables. Gentleman at lift, he was great, knowledgeable and fantastic service, every day. He was a slight man with dark hair. We weren't aware we were going to have to leave 200 dollars deposit. It was returned to us within 4 days! All in all fabulous!! Location was a 1010 as youre very close to time square and are able to walk to everything needed.  The rooms were very good and well maintained besides the fact the cleaning people never took out the trash from the bin underneath the desk. Stayed full for 3 days until I had to shove everything into the restroom bin so theyd finally take it out. We stayed for 7 days and only made it to breakfast 2 days before we gave up after. We had 7 people around 830 am and waited probably 30 minutes total before getting to the front and then they said they could not and will not seat us together so wed have to sit 4 and 3. The next day we tried again after waiting even longer and they refused to seat us as 7 because they said they couldnt accommodate that. We then waited pushed off to the side for our table of 4 and 3 while they sat 10 tables before us even tho we were first in line at this point. We asked whats the matter and the lady said shes waiting for a table of 7 to seat us together after telling us they couldnt accommodate us and wed have to sit separately. We finally get seated at two tables but 10 minutes apart because theyd sit other people before us. On the day of check in we had 4 rooms total. Three rooms checked in successfully while my room had to be delayed a day since there was a confusion with transportation dates.  We still paid the first night tho we werent staying in the hotel. We finally arrived the next day and tried to check in and the front desk lady basically told us they already booked someone in our room since we didnt show up the other 3 rooms mentioned we got delayed and would be in the next day and we still paid for that night . We had to wait 30 minutes at the check in counter while they went to speak to a manager to see if we can even check in to the room. All while the front desk lady was rude and said to us dont be rude , its been a long day.  We got two bottles of water the first day and we never saw water ever again even tho we stayed for 7 days and had 3 people in the room. Elevators were also a problem as we had to wait 10 minutes to even have an elevator come to the floor just to be full and you had to wait again. Im on level 7 so took the stairs a handful of times as I had places to be. During breakfast hours they reserve one elevator just for breakfast so youre now left with only 2 elevators for the 600 people staying in the hotel. The last day obviously we had luggage and needed to take the elevator rather than the stairs and we waited 30 minutes to get all 3 of us down to the lobby in 3 separate elevators. I spoke to another guest outside the elevator and they said he waited for the elevator and went back to the room because he gave up. Overall the experience could be a whole lot better but the area was good. when getting to the hotel and checking into the room it took a long process and that was ok. until we got up to the room and there was wet paint on the wall. the staff didn't give us a warning i got wet paint all over my pants and there was paint splattered across the ironing board and we got paint on our shirts as well. the rooms other then that were quite nice and have a great view. but there are 3 elevators and in the morning they use two of those for there breakfast and it takes about 30 minutes of waiting to even get a elevator. the breakfast is a whole other thing we waited 20 minutes in the lobby to get on a elevator then when you get upstairs you have to wait another 20 minutes to get even be seated. the staff as well didn't do anything about the paint and they brought the new ironing board and iron to the wrong room. the staff as well was over all rude and disappointing. there were a few nice ones but most of everyone else was rude. we had a manager for the breakfast come and chew out my dad because we had 5 people total and only 4 people waiting and the 1 other person was waiting for a elevator. over all i was very displeased and appalled at the way the staff handled the situations",no operation time,"gym, lodging, restaurant, bar, health, food, point_of_interest, establishment"

The staff were all welcoming and friendly and very helpful. We had a lovely corner room with a great view of the Hudson River and lots of space. The location in Times Square is good for visiting the city as it is close to the theatres and other midtown attractions. It was easy to walk the city area as well as to Central Park. The restaurants in the hotel were also of a high standard with good food and service. Best hotel in Times Square by far. Close to shopping, theatres and great restaurants. Love the service here. The M club is amazing and the floor to ceiling windows provide a great view. Loved the gym too open 24 hours  very convenient. Would definitely stay here again. It was probaby the best hotel experience ever. Travelling with 2 kids, from the moment we got off the cab the staff was so helpful and welcoming. A HUGE THANK YOU to FRED at check in. He was so accommodating to our needs and friendly to talk to. He made sure we were okay and comfortable before heading up to our room which was amazing. Great view of Time Square which was a bonus. Everything was perfect and all staff were amazing. Would definitely stay here again and cannot recommend it enough. It was Amazing!! I've never been but it looks beautiful. Marriott is known for their elegance and excellent hotel upkeep. Their housekeeping quality has always been unmatched, even against other major hotel companies. New York has also been said to be a great place to live overall. Many people who reside there have access to many resources that rural areas don't as of yet. Honestly just trying to boost it because the views are amazing! I hope others would like this as well. I know personally I wouldn't want to make a long trip here just for my hotel to not be up to basic standards for cleaning. However, I would definitely consider this hotel as a top contender in my search for room and board on any type of trip. Great location but can also be noisy during night since it is right at the heart to the NYC.

The time square neon lights are never off so be aware if you are sensitive to light when sleeping. They do have blackout curtains which should do the trick.

The gym is spacious and has a great view of the square. The M lounge also has great buffet breakfast and snacks. One of the best M lounges I have been!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Arlo Midtown,"351 W 38th St, New York, NY 10018, USA",4.3,40.75574,-73.9937868,"My Fiance  I stayed here for our Anniversary. The customer service was incredible. The rooms were clean, the atmosphere was fabulous. This location was in perfect distance for walking to almost everything we did, or a short Uber ride. We had a great stay! I would highly recommend it! The rooms are a little small but we expected that in the city but for just the two of us it was perfect. There was enough storage and hanging space for all our clothes  toiletries etc.
The rooftop bar was great as well! Travelling with 2 adults and 2 teenage children, we needed 2 rooms due to the small sizes of the hotel rooms quite typical for NYC. We had the rooms with a terrace on the 2nd floor, which didnt add any value. Being on the lower level meant there was an instant  connection with the neighbour in the building right across  Screens were kept down throughout our stay. No issues with noise though and rooms were clean!

Good gym with enough equipment for a decent workout.

Great bar with an adjoining shop allowing to buy drinks and snacks throughout the day. Restaurant was good too! If youre lucky enough, youll get served by Junior, who, with his charm and great sense of customer service, assured a great start to our days!

Location of the hotel was great for us with subway stations nearby and plenty of places only a couple of blocks away, which we could reach on foot within 15 minutes Times Square, Empire State building, Madison Square Garden, Summit One, Broadway, etc.

Only disappointment was that we didnt get to experience the Rooftop. On the only night we would have been able to enjoy it, the rooftop  was closed off entirely for a private event without notice to hotel guests. We werent allowed to even take a peek a shame when you select a hotel with this feature. This review is long overdue, but I absolutely adored this place on two separate trips to the city! The location is perfectright in the heart of Manhattan, where there's a mix of city life and tourism, yet it feels slightly removed from the hustle and bustle. The rooms are small but wellmaintained and comfortable, with no excessive noise from neighboring rooms. The nighttime views were a real treat! It's also within walking distance of Times Square, Broadway, Chelsea Market, and the High Line! And the smell they have blasting throughout the hotel is absolutely divine! Well definitely make it a point to stay here again! Avoid Room 206.....

My experience was quite disappointing.

First off, I would recommend avoiding the lower levels of the hotel. The room I was assigned had multiple issues the fridge didnt work, the air conditioning didn't work and to top it all off, the shower was barely functioning.

What made the situation worse was the lack of sympathy from the staff. When I reported these problems, I expected at least some understanding or willingness to help, maybe even a breakfast ? But I didnt receive any support.

Overall, I was very disappointed with my stay. I would not recommend this hotel based on my experience. We stayed for two nights in a room with a balcony.  I have to say the hotel was pretty bloody sensational.  We ate breakfast in the restaurant in the lobby both mornings.  The brekkie burger was sensational and the pancakes were truly sensational.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to fellow Aussies visiting NYC who were looking for a good location and a contemporary hotel with good service.

Mondrian New York Park Avenue,"444 Park Avenue South @, E 30th St, New York, NY 10016, USA",3.7,40.7448048,-73.9832943,"I'm not sure why the hotel has so many negative reviews about stolen property. Seems to be spam. My experience was quite good. The room has a contemporary style, decent and clean, definitely comfortable bed. Breakfast on the terrace was meh, but a good space for a working breakfast.
Special shout out to Sarah at the front desk who was so sweet and helpful. She even stepped in to help with something when her colleague was seemingly reluctant to. Keep it up! Beds are good, but not for sharing. Overall comfortable.  The design of the sliding door is not practical, nor private. The baseboards don't let the slide, fully cover the bathroom door opening. Shower is roomy but lacks water pressure.  Very nice terrace on 15th floor for breakfast  events. Staff was very polite  helpful. Great stay at the hotel. Checked in at 4pm, smooth process. Also bit the bullet and availed of the valet service. 122 total for 24 hour parking had an ""oversized"" vehicle. Not the most economical but certainly convenient. Room was big, clean and it came with continental breakfast for all. Left our bags at the lobby the next day while we were out and got it, together with car, later in the afternoon. Easy peasy. Would stay again. We considered the hotel as a place to stay at the end of October. But thank God, that I read the reviews and talked to the guests who lived in this bedbug house. Not only do the rooms often not correspond to reality, they have a bunch of shortcomings such as Nonworking air conditioning, broken taps, torn off damaged baseboards. Bed bugs have been repeatedly found in this hotel.
I also managed to talk to people who confirmed the information that hotel employees under the guise of maintenance penetrate into the rooms and shamelessly hide safes in the absence of guests.
I recommend everyone to just read the reviews carefully before booking a hotel room. Comparing them for different times, it is clear that the problem with air conditioners has not been solved for at least the last 10 months, as well as the problem with food that many guests complain about, as well as the problem with the quality of service when booking and checkin.
The only obvious plus is the location of the hotel. My partner and I stayed there two nights August 8 and 9, room 713.  Nice hotel, but I came home with bedbug bites all over my body. I can't have been bitten anywhere else. We contacted the hotel several times and they did not take us seriously. We also tried to obtain compensation through Expedia nothing was done.

Expedia said they were really sorry for us, gave us  nice phrases making us believe that they would help us. Absolutely nothing was done.

In short, do not go there and if you have to go, leave your luggage in the shower and inspect the mattresses!

"Holiday Inn Manhattan 6th Ave - Chelsea, an IHG Hotel","125 W 26th St, New York, NY 10001, USA",3.6,40.745414,-73.992242,"This hotel was in a great location. It was about a 15 minute walk to the Empire State Building, 10 minute walk to Penn Station and less than 10 minutes to get to the subway. There were so many places to get food within walking distance. There was a Whole Foods about 2 blocks away. The location felt safe to me. And it wasnt too noisy. I stayed 5 nights and slept great every night.

The hotel itself was very clean, the beds and pillows were so comfortable. It came with an iron and blowdryer. Very good towels. They come with full dove products in bath and shower  so you wouldnt need to bring your own shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The AC worked great too. They also have tables and chairs to sit outside and eat right in front of the hotel too. Only downside was our room didnt have a refrigerator or microwave but I knew that when I booked. Id recommend this place and Id come back again. 1st at all during check in is a bad experience for us. Waiting for the queue is alright. When its our turn is entertain by a old guy who looks like a big boss. Just Asking a question , answering very rude and impolite way cause us not thinking to ask anymore. As a service line how dare you talk to the guest he should take for further training.

Waiting Elevator is the most tough part , the elevator was old and slow the hotel only have 2 elevator !!! and share with the cleaner. We met the housekeeping time 1 of the elevator was used by cleaner only 1!!! Elevator for guests it was really unpleasant.

Thats the only good part is the room AC is function well and comfortable temperature. And the housekeeper was good service and arrange our pyjamas and bedsheets neat and tidy on the bed. I booked a reservation in September for 4 nights in October at this hotel. In the week prior to my arrival date I received 2 confirmation emails from the hotel.
When I arrived on Tuesday, October 8 to check in I was told that my reservation had been cancelled and they were fully booked. They were turning ALL guests away. They claimed they had tried to contact me that day to advise me they weren't able to process the payment for my reservation. I was in the air en route to NY but had no missed calls when I turned my phone back on. I also had no emails from the hotel letting me know they'd cancelled my reservation. When I finally managed to contact IHG to see what had happened they informed me the reservation was cancelled because I wasn't at the hotel at ""check in time"". When does that EVER happen? Guests do not line up at check in time for a room! They were making stuff up to cover for their own error in cancelling the reservation.In the end I'm glad we has the most awful first night in NYC imaginable because we found the most incredible alternate hotel and now I know to never, EVER stay in a Holiday Inn again since they just make up their reservation rules as they go. I booked directly on IHG.com because I know the hotels treat guests who book through 3rd party sites horribly. But when it comes to Holiday Inn not even that's good enough. They're managed independently and their managers can do whatever the hell they want. Avoid this hotel like the plague. Had a great time at this hotel! Location was amazing and an easy walk to many attractions. Room had a big TV and was able to fit the group and our carry on suitcases for a quick stay. Note there is no refrigerator nor microwave in the room, but there is a free breakfast of fruit and bagels until 10am. Appreciated that we could drop off luggage before check in and after check out to explore the city more easily. Pros The hotel has been remodeled, so everything looks pretty nice. A kingsize bed is just enough to fit two 6ft adults comfortably. The room is small, but I don't think it's a significant disadvantage since this is NYC we still had enough space for two large suitcases. The location is very good, right in the center of the city, but on a smaller, less busy street, and subway stations are just a few blocks away. I did not have any problems with noise either from the street or the AC. The bathroom is small but clean and has enough amenities for a 4night trip. Checkincheckout was smooth and fast.

Cons There are two small elevators barely fit 5 people WITHOUT luggage, so guests might have to wait during peak hours. The microwave and ice machine were on a different floor, which was quite inconvenient.

Overall, my stay here was a pleasant experience. I think this hotel is a considerable option in this price range.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Grandview Hotel New York,"31-6 Linden Pl, Flushing, NY 11354, USA",3.9,40.7691244,-73.8327135,"This Hotel is under new ownership.  The high ratings are most likely dated and simply not accurate now.  It felt safe and was relatively clean.  There is free parking. good luck finding that at other area hotels It did have decent connectivity. It's not near the metro by any stretch, but it is on the bus line.  Fast food, Dunks, and a super market are very close. The room was very small and not sound proof, heard lots of hallway noise. Over all, I would rate this place as average, not that bad, not that great.  It did the trick for a single night while in transit through the city. This was my goto hotel when I was working in nearby flushing meadows park. The first two visits were good but the remaining 3 were less than ideal. This hotel has a few things going for it... free not guaranteed parking and within walking distance to a few food places.

After my second visit I started to noticed the lack of hotel etiquette. People were playing music from their rooms at all hours of the night and I could smell the strong order of cigarette smoke in the bathroom. It became so bad I had to close the bathroom door at night. I am hoping things will change because this hotel is in a very convenient location when I return to the area next year. I strongly believe that the good ratings are pretty outdated at this point. Going in, I knew from seeing other reviews that the room would be dirty and to not have great expectations regarding cleanliness, and I took precautions against that. However, the service has been abysmal on top of that. Imagine being ready to start your day only to get paint over your clothing because there was no warning or communication that people would be painting your door. Worse yet, it was the last set of clothing before the last day, and by the time I noticed the paint has firmly dried into the clothing. I tried asking for help and saying something. The painter unhelpfully said to wash itwhich we did not have access to anyway, and by the time we would reach a place to wash the clothing the damage would have been done. He then said he would find some chemicals that can help take off paintand after 15 minutes, I figured he was not going to come back. I talked to the front regarding the situation, and much of the same, nothing was done. I am not coming back to this establishment. I would highly recommend others to look elsewhere, despite cheaper prices. I do not recommend staying here.. the rating is artificially inflated. When I got there, they gave me someone else's room key so that was awkward when I tried to go in the room. The bathroom door handle was broken and the shower curtain was moldy. Only good thing is free parking and a clean bed to sleep on. The room was tiny and the amenities are minimal. There was a single staff member doing his best but he didn't have much to work with. When I arrived, the room would not open. I went into the elevator and the elevator broke down with my wife and I in it. I called the front desk and they rebooted the elevator and I went back to the desk. They then gave me another room and the bathroom was dirty and the toilet would not flush. They then gave me another room that was okay. The next morning someone knocked at my door at 1056am when checkout time was 1100am. When I asked for late checkout, they said I had to pay right then and there. They were pretty rude. I would have expected a phone call. Not someone rudely knocking at my door before checkout time even arrived.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The International Cozy Inn,"248 Malcolm X Blvd, New York, NY 10027, USA",4.3,40.8060507,-73.9464026,"I didn't know what to expect after I booked this last minute when airbnb cancelled my account and reservation. It is kind of an odd place, but in a good way. It is very different compared to your typical hotel room and that's what makes it interesting.  Plus there is Whole foods is right across the street! The host's were fantastic and helpful. It is very convenient to the train in a diverse neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again. I recently stayed 2 nights at this BEAUTIFUL sophisticated hotel and was greeted by two of the most sweetest human beings Ive ever crossed in this line of business the owners, I felt safe and was really taken back at how beautiful the entry way all the way to how my room was. My eyes just lit up! It was breath taking!  This was my home away from home! The cleanliness from top to bottom made me feel like I was in heaven! The room was so cool and welcoming, the beautiful kitchen area, the bathroom, the space was just perfect! My first night asleep in the most comfortable bed I laid on in a while, had make waking up feeling rejuvenated and ready to take on New York! I will definitely be back and I will most definitely be recommending the International Cozy Inn to everyone I come in contact with! A beautiful hotel accompanied by two beautiful ladies who make sure all needs are met is where one should be each and every time they come to Harlem! Cozy is a small club bar dance dinner place.  Staff was very respectful  and kind. Great place to stay in Harlem with in walking distance to Central Park, Sylvia's Soul Food and the Apollo theater. Cozy is a family owned walk up with a look of charm in a great location. We loved it. We were also within walking distance of at least 4 other parks.  We walked to the Studio Museum in Harlem.  Somewhat gentrified but not too much so.  Easy close access to the subway.. and Starbucks. Great place, very nice people, safe, clean and quiet. I stayed 1 week at the hotel and I have nothing but good things to say about it. If I ever come back to NYC I will definitely book the same one. Subway station is 1 block away and there are a lot of places to eat and drink near by. Highly recommended!","Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM

International Student Center Youth Hostel (The Center),"38 W 88th St, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.4,40.7871096,-73.969994,"It's a nice small hostel in a nice neighborhood.
Staff was friendly and helpful, and common areas were very clean for a hostel.
Occupancy was low when I went so maybe I got lucky.
I'll definitely recommend this to my friends visiting Manhattan.
Just one issue  the beds and floor were really squeaky, so if it wasn't so empty I imagine it'd be quite loud. a lovely hostel to stay, right next to central park. i had this place recommended to me by a friend and it was so lovely. comfy beds, clean common areas and fully equipped kitchen. great location and helpful staff. Came here on holiday with my cousin for a few days and it was perfect. Great location, really welcoming and helpful staff, nice common areas, clean and comfortable rooms. Didn't spend much time there as we were out visiting most of the time but it was the perfect fit for our visit. Fabulous hostel! We loved our home away from home. Staff were so friendly, everything was super clean and the vibe was great. Plenty of hot water even though it took a while to come through, kitchen was well equiped and lounge area was lovely with TV, games and lots of books. We were on the top floor so there were a few stairs to climb but no drama for us. A bit noisy at times but that is to be expected in a hostel, most travellers were very polite. We stayed for 9 nights and overall thought it was great, especially the price for NYC. My friends and I checked out immediately after our first night. We could not stay even one more night due to the lack of privacy in coed rooms, inadequate bathroomsWCs for 10bed dorms, and poor security for personal belongings.

The mixedgender 10bed room on the 3rd floor was excruciatingly hot even with the ceiling fan, so my friend couldnt sleep at all. The 10bed dorm on the 2nd floor smelled absolutely horrible worse than any cheap hostel weve been to all over the world. The employee Kabir noticed right away then opened a window and sprayed febreeze, but it smelled just as bad that night.

The stench wasnt caused by guests who happen to have smelly body odor it was caused by the bathroom floors being practically flooded. Guests who wore their socks into the bathroom rather than shower shoes got soaking wet socks and no way to dry them out. There was only one toilet for each 10bed room up to TEN PEOPLE sharing ONE TOILET. The 2 showers were in the same room as the toilet so you couldnt go peepoop if someone was in the shower.
Although I have stayed in coed hostels as a woman traveler before, due to the bathroom situation here I felt uncomfortable and waited over an hour until all the men were done. At least there was a mirror in the bedroom so people could brush their hair, put on makeup, etc.

Theres no elevatorlift, so even if you book the nicer rooms on the fourth floor, you have to haul your suitcase up 3 flights of stairs. The upstairs wifi was extremely slow so youd have to go downstairs to look something up. The personal lockers in the room were very small. You could fit a purse and expensive electronics like laptops and tablet, but suitcases, duffel bags, and large backpacks had to be shoved underneath the bunk bed on the dirty floor.

We arrived in the morning, so we needed to store our luggage until 3pm checkin. They just put our bags in plain sight on the first floor.

A few lowcost upgrades would greatly improve the guest experience. Here are my recommendations
 Put bath mats in front of each shower to prevent soaking wet bathroom floors.
 Purchase a bulk supply of cheap plastic flipflops so guests can purchase shower shoes to prevent the spread of bacteria athletes foot and the smell of dirty wet socks.
 Offer at least one bedroom option for womenonly.
 Hang curtainsprivacy screens around each bed.
 Replace the lockerscubbies in each room with much larger ones, andor add some heavyduty shelving to keep luggage off the floor.
 Mount some extension cords on the walls so that top bunks can charge their devices, and consider adding individual lamps and fans.
 For a higherinvestment upgrade, add at least 4 more sinks and toilets, and ensure there are private entries to each shower.

I was pleased with the employees, although I suspect they were understaffed.
It seems Kabir was the only worker with whom we interacted. He was very courteous, always inquired if we felt comfortable, and tried his absolute best to improve our situation. We asked for a refund at least partial for the second night, citing the unsanitary bathroom floor and lack of privacy. Kabir called management to try to advocate for us, but ultimately they denied our reasonable request.

The building is a charming historic brownstone in Upper West Side, only half a block from Central Park and around the corner from the nearest Subway station 86th St stop on blue C train  orange B train so its very walkable. The building is not labeled as a hostel from the outside, so you ring the doorbell, call the phone number, or use a room key to enter its quite safe from the street.

The 70yearold nonprofit housed there Association of the World Travel Exchange has a wonderful mission, and the space would probably work somewhat well for people who already know each other. However,  its currently inadequate as a hostel open to the public for vacation accommodations.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 11:00 PM

All necessary needs are met in the hostel well, shower, clean room, towel, soap and shampoo etc. Breakfast was ideal for me and good coffee. Very flexible with checking in and out, would stay again. Sunny is a great host In the New York City, best location for travellers, solo travellers and groups.
They take care of your luggage, breakfast, etc.
Heartwarming hospitality and welcoming attitude, hard to find such a great place and people in NYC.

Sunny is an amazing host. He helped managing the stay and gave good suggestions for exploring the city. Invaluable goodies at the check out time was added cherry on top.
Definitely recommended, would book again when visiting NY. Very welcoming stay for little money. The staff is so helpful and nice especially Sunny. Breakfast offers good diversity and its very good. Although the rooms are small the bed is very comfortable. I would absolutely recommend this place, regarding the great location in the city! I had an exceptional experience staying at the hostel near Penn Station. The convenience of its location was unbeatable, allowing me to easily access various parts of the city. What truly made my stay memorable was the remarkable hospitality extended by Sunny. From the moment I arrived, Sunny's warm and welcoming demeanor made me feel right at home. Their attention to detail and willingness to assist with any queries or needs were outstanding. The facilities were clean and wellmaintained, contributing to a comfortable and pleasant stay. Whether it was recommendations for local attractions or ensuring that my stay was seamless, Sunny's dedication to guest satisfaction was evident in every interaction. The overall atmosphere of the hostel was friendly and inviting, making it a perfect place to meet fellow travelers and share experiences. The combination of its prime location and exceptional service makes this hostel a top choice for anyone visiting the area. I am already looking forward to my next visit and highly recommend this hostel to others seeking a memorable and hasslefree stay. Incredible place. Only great things to say. Sunny was a terrific host  he went out of his way to meet needs or requests. An amazing human being who represents the building and the organization well. Everyone who works here truly cares. All the money they make goes to support their charity efforts, so their intentions are very clear. Also, you literally cannot beat the location.

The Brooklyn Riviera Hostel,"781 Prospect Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11216, USA",3.9,40.6745639,-73.950661,"This rustic but charming hostel made me feel very welcomed during my NYC stay. It has the basics for your everyday needs and the outdoor area is a wonderful place to connect with people. The staff is very professional and they always will make an effort if you have any needs. The metro is about 10min walking distance and there are a lot of stores nearby. I can highly recommend this hostel especially if you are on a budget in NYC and that's something that the hostel staff pointed out, that it should stay that way. Big thx folks. Guys stay here fr. Ive stayed in most other hostels in nyc and this is by far the best one. Only one with an actual social vibe! The owner and workers are lovely. Feels more family vibe and the atmosphere makes it so easy to chat to people. Yes its not as fancy or in the fanciest area but you actually get a proper nyc experience in a house in a normal street. Area is cute and close to prospect park. This hostel is awesome love it Cool location and people. Hostel itself rather rundown and a building site.

I find the uncleanliness dangerous. In particular, it is extremely questionable to hand out bedding such as blankets without covers. These are probably simply used several times cotton blankets

Would not want to sleep here again

Proper bedding should be used and washed at more than 60 degrees after each use Cheapest Hostel in new york but it is very nice.
The owners are great. The express train is very convenient. Also easy access to the airport. Was really looking forward to staying at this location but then saw it was international travelers only. Of course there is no problem having people from diverse backgrounds staying there, but to cut out American citizens insulting and would probably be illegal the other way around.

Jazz on Columbus Circle Hostel,"940 8th Ave, New York, NY 10029, USA",3.8,40.765691,-73.983384,"The location is really central, only 15 minutes walk away from Central park, 15 Minutes walk away from times square, 1215minutes walk away from Rockefeller Center. The entrance to hostel is very unclear as there is no billboard or signage, but still i could find it. The free breakfast on 3rd floor includes bagel, coffee, jam and butter. There is also a kitchen, free for guests to use. The room is good, but there are no toiletries except hand wash and also no towel, so do bring everything with you. The metallic bunker beds are okay but whenever we turn our side, they make noise, some make more and some make less. The blanket is really thin, but there is central heating and each room has its own thermostate, so you can set the temperature according to your need. The blanket and sheet looked clean and washed but they had some long hair in them. There are locker boxes in each room for storing luggage, but without a lock. The power sockets are just next to the lower beds, which is not good. The upper beds have no near by power sockets, so either they leave their electronics on the floor for charging, or they bring a longer charging cable. I knew what i was booking, so nothing caught me by surprise and i was satisfied with me stay. Location is good. FULL STOP.
Amenities and facilities lacking. No AC in common area, AC broken not fixed. Summer time hot weather. Sharing fridge a mess, no label. Guest took other guest items from fridge, happened to me.

When check in, rest room soap dispenser empty, have to ask them to refill. I stayed for 4 nights, on third day I went to front desk to ask for a new towel. The staff said need to charge 5 for towel, what!!

I have stayed in a few backpacker hostel, this is definitely not recommended The rooms are dirty, the bathrooms are dirty, we had hole in the wall and they fixed it with putting towels inbetween. No tables in the room, the light is not working properly, the microwave is broken. The plugs are sketchy. For breakfast are not enough bagels. The shower only has light pressure, there is no real lobby. You can hear everything through the windows, even if they are closed and its very cold near the window, so if u sleep next to the window u get really cold. There are just super thin blankets in winter and in a 6 bed room are just 4 lockers. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND TO STAY HERE!! This is the 2nd time I've stayed here and I don't know why the reviews are so harsh. The staff are super lovely and accommodating. Me and my friend had booked at different times and were allocated different rooms for the first night but after that the staff were happy to move us to the same room. Rooms are cleaned daily and have great Aircon, even if it is a little noisy. The most fustrating thing is not having access to a plug on the top bunk and having to leave your phone to charge on the floor. Breakfast of bagels and teacoffee was set up daily which was a treat, especially if on a budget. I feel most of the bad comments on here were from people who were expecting a hotel but couldn't afford one. It's also in a super amazing and central location. The only downside was trying to email the hostel before had. I messaged about 3 weeks before asking to be placed with my friend and then 5 days before I messages everyday and I finally got a reply asking my friends details but still nothing was done about it until we got there. Anyway, long review short I had electricity, a shower and a place to sleep and I can't say anything bad about that!
 bring a lock for the lockers.
 first time2019 I wasn't given a towel but 2nd time 2022 I was.
 Filtered water refil.
 there is a toilet in the common area if someone's in your room toilet in the seating area First off, the location is excellent. On a big street right next Central Park, with a lot of public transport connections and restaurants.

The room was not very clean and I felt that it was expensive for what you actually get.
One thing that I really didn't like was being charged 5 dollars a bag for storing my bags for a couple hours in their storage room. This is something that is usually free of charge everywhere else i've been.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Kama Central Park,"36 W 106th St, New York, NY 10025, USA",3.8,40.7981293,-73.9609289,"We had a terrible experience because we booked a room for two adults and a child, we paid 990 and when we arrived at 11pm with our son, they told us there was no bed for him... their only solution was to share a queen bed with our 13 year old son... which was unacceptable. We had to look for another hotel to sleep in and they still haven't returned our money... terrible service from the hotel. From the next day, they put up a notice that they did not accept children. It was false advertising what they did to us. Biggest gripe would be the quality of the womens bathroomshowers, the third floor bathroom the toilet leaks and sprays out of the handle when you flush. The light above the other toilet needs to be changed. The showers are old however acceptable, but the last shower on the left 3rd floor the door is off the hinges. The sink faucets need replacing immediately. They are extremely old and hard to wash hands, brush teeth or wash your face when you have to have one hand holding the bottom down to keep it on and you have to hold it down pretty hard I found that the mens bathroom and shower room they are separate were spectacular in comparison. In mens bathroom and shower room the sink was in workable condition however the showers themselves are pretty narrow. Also how come the mens bathroom has a full length mirror and the womens doesnt? Im assuming they are still under construction that could be my only guess. The bar in the lobby also looks to have once been or plans to be a full bar and coffee stop but is completely out of commission as no one is working that station, its not advertised that it is in commission but just a heads up bc I watched multiple people wait for service at the bar. And the ac unit in my room looked like it had not been cleaned or serviced in at least a decade, every time I came back to my room my nose would start to run and would cause me to sneeze. The cleanliness inside of the pod was questionable liquid marks on wall of pod door also the little sign in side the pod is hard to see because of the location in relation to the overhead pod light. Great place to stay for a couple of days, especially if youre gonna be staying out most of the time. Everything was great, easy check in, bed is clean and big enough  Plentiful Showers and bathrooms were clean. Only thing that can be improved is the Air conditioning since it was summer season and quite humid outside when I visited. AVOID! I'm currently staying in this hostel. I was woken up at around midnight by another guest, who claimed that my bed was hers. Yes, it was hers, unfortunately there was a mix up during checkin. I was asked to move to my correct room at midnight, which I did, as it was the right thing to do. I was offered perhaps a coffee for the trouble... When I asked for a complimentary upgrade due to the inconveniences there was a better room available according to multiple reservation websites, I was told that it is not possible as the hostel is 99 full. Most worrying is that I was told that this has happened before. Please, pay a bit more and find a better property to stay at.There were also other issues such as the room code not working during checkin and dirty bathrooms, but I was somehow ok with it as the girl who checked me in was nice and apologetic about the code not working and fixed it promptly. But invading my privacy several times in the middle of the night and asking me to move to another room is just another level that I hadn't experienced before.  I hate complaining but this might be helpful for someone else. I do not recommend at all. The Hostel is on the Upper west side, closest subway is either 103 st or 110 st, it's overall easy to find, 30min from Times Sq. The building doesn't have any lift so consider this. The reception is open 247, everybody working here looks around 20 something, they are friendly and available to respond to questions. Luggage storage free of charge for 1 day. The rooms are decent size, I only shared with one other, there's a lot of privacy in the pods but it gets very hot and since the windows don't open the air con is the way room will always smell a bit. Lockers were tiny, lock needed. In the morning you can make your own bagels in the kitchen downstairs with jam or butter. Showers and toilets are separate men and women, they work ok overall there were never many people around although the place was fully booked. Overall I would recommend it but you need to be adaptable",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Jazz on The Park Hostel,"36 W 106th St, New York, NY 10025, USA",3.2,40.798094,-73.960939,"Great location for walking around manhattan. Its just across from Central Park with a pretty decent bodega down the street. I came here as a lone traveler. Its a bed and a small locker. What else could you need. They clean the rooms at like 8 am every morning so you better be up. Staff was friendly and the place was clean.

I recommend a stop at the Dublin house pub if you come here. Its a brisk walk but its worth it. Would not recommend. This place is just a spot to rest for the night.

Probably the worst hostel Ive been to. If you have a top bunk there is no outlet for you. There was not a functioning sink on the floor. Only one shower for 30 ppl. Facilities were not clean. Bring your own lock for the lockers.

On the plus side, they do have bagels in the morning and location is great. I stayed only one night and it was really correct contrary to the very negative reviews and I was well received by the people at the reception. My room was in fair condition and the bathroom too. The location is currently undergoing work on the kitchen living area but thats not a big deal. The localisation is perfect with the metro nearby. The only thing I would recommend is that some improvement work should be done in the toilet  add some curtains in the bedroom etc Its very dingy and dirty. I ran into a lot of roaches. They do not offer free drinkable water. You either have to pay for each bottle of water out of the vending machine, or try your luck with the brown tap water. I stayed here a few years ago and it still haunts me. I do not advise any one ,I do not recommend booking this hotsel. The fact that the hotel is close to central Park and it is in Manhattan, but I did not like staying in it. The bathroom is not clean. The faucets are broken on the fifth floor. The bathroom faucet does not have water. The electric socket in the room does not work, even though I asked the employe to repair , but didn't ,The room was very hot at night. The kitchen is not qualified and contains a lot of dust, other than what you see in the picture. I do not advise anyone to rent this hotel.","Monday: Open 24 hours

I never stayed at a hostel before but I enjoyed it. You can't think of it like a hotel. It's more like rooming at a family home. Respect each other and clean up after yourself.  For 10.00 you get a towel or bring your own. There is a five below near and target. I enjoyed it.  And owner was very nice. The stay was perfectly fine for the price. It IS just a guy renting his apartment out to fit as many people in, so expect to be sharing an apartment with about 8 other people. Other than that, cant say I felt unsafe sleeping here, or leaving my stuff in the rooms while I was showering or grabbing a bite. The reason why it is a 4 star and not a 5 is because the checkin was very sketchy and was totally unclear. I was welcomed by a man wearing a mask. He brought me upstairs and would not let me enter my room. I already paid online and he insisted I pay 150 in cash. This is not a hotel it is someone's apartment. Dirty place, see pictures below the room is about the same. If you can live with that, then the location is great.
I almost forgot this is not a hotel, it's a flat to which you may or may not enter according to the manager who you must call by phone. Good luck with your tour stay. DO NOT SLEEP HERE. First of all, THIS IS NOT A HOSTEL. It's an  very dirty apartment with matress on the floor in the living room.

NY Moore Hostel,"179 Moore St, Brooklyn, NY 11206, USA",4.2,40.7043676,-73.9376324,"Perfectly location! Next to some great shopping, coffee shops, and eats. The rooms were good pricing for a place to sleep if youre out and about all day. The service was phenomenal, and the common space was cozy and welcoming. I would 100 stay here again. Awesome hostel in NYC! Clean, safe, comfortable, close to food, transit.

They have full kitchen, game room, computer room, rooftop, terrace for you. Andrew at the front desk was nice and welcoming. Check in was a breeze.
Love the different art works on the wall throughout the building. Will definitely stay here again when traveling solo. This place is fantastic. What a gem of a hostel. I found myself needing a room for one night in NYC fairly last minute, and this was the only place I could find under 100. I was nervous because I hadnt stayed in a hostel in years, but my nerves were quickly laid to rest upon arriving. The front desk workers were kind, energetic, and helpful, allowing me to store my bag while they readied my dorm room and letting me unwind in the common area after a long travel day. The common area is excellent. The complementary coffee was always hot and tasty, and the people were always smiling and friendly. Had a nice convo or two with travelers, enjoyed perusing the eclectic book selection. Theres even another common area downstairs with a pool table and much more. The art on the walls throughout the building is top notch  an excellent wall sized painting of Salvador Dali was right outside my room, and many other counterculture figures and pop culture characters could be found. The front desk have tons of recommendations if you need them. My room was shared with three others, with a nice private bathroom. I was afraid Id be kept up by noise. I may have just gotten lucky, or my earplugs were on point, but I didnt get woken up once, which is next to impossible in a hostel. I desperately needed sleep, and I ended up sleeping over 10 hours. I woke up feeling refreshed and ready to go into the city, and I have the NY Moore Hostel to thank for that. If I ever need a night in New York, no doubt Ill be staying here again. I was greeted by the personnel at the front desk for my visit from 920921. Adam was helpful in showing me around the hostel and getting me to my room. I had a 1 bed in a 4 bedroom stay, very clean room and bed. The hostel was easy to find and there was always someone available at the front desk for assistance. Would recommend and would come again for my next one night stay in NYC! It's only getting 3 stars because the staff were super friendly and helpful.
As soon as we got to our room we found a durex packet in the bin so we knew the room wasn't cleaned properly. The floor was pretty bad with hairs left in the bathroom and lastly the location of the hostel is directly on the flight path of planes leaving LaGuardia airport so every 10 minutes you'd hear a plane flying over at night which isn't ideal if you're a light sleeper.","Monday: Open 24 hours

I cannot say enough great things about this place!! I had a beautiful spacious room with private bathroom and comfy bed! Wonderful breakfast included and all at an unbelievable price! The walk to my son's apartment was only 5 blocks and it is completely safe and quiet! Sister Delia made my check in and check out so simple and she is a delight! All the sisters I met were so kind! I will definitely be back! Thank you all at Centro Maria for helping make my first experience in NYC a great one! God bless you all!
Dixie I stayed at Centro Maria during my research stay in NYC 20222023. I had a great experience! The sisters and all the girls I met at this residence were very friendly and helpful. They made me feel like part of a big family from the moment I moved in. I had a beautiful, very spacious room with a private bathroom and large windows. And all this at a very affordable price much lower than the current rent prices in NYC! The sisters prepare breakfast and the kitchen is very well equipped. The house is clean and in a residential area. The neighborhood feels safe and peaceful. I often went out for a run in a nearby park, and I always felt much safer than wandering around Manhattan. I worked in Manhattan, and my commute time was 30 minutes. The residence is well connected since it has the 231st subway station nearby and bus lines stopping two streets away. All in all, I had a great time at Centro Maria. I made some great friends and I will certainly stay there again next time I am in NYC! The best experience living in New York was staying at Centro Maria. The sisters always make you feel at home, and its the safest, most cozy environment for young girls studying or working in the city. I wouldnt have chosen any other place to stay in New York. All my roommates were great as well. Everything from the food and the loving and caring attitude of everybody is just incredible. 100 recommend it. This place is a hidden GEM!  My daughter is currently staying there for school.  The nuns take care of ""their girls""!  They make the ladies feel like home.  Family style meals, get togethers, and caring staff,  I couldn't ask for more for my daughter. God bless you for providing a safe environment for young ladies! Very Good if you need to be sure your daughter has been safe and affordable. Excellent desserts , Thank you Sisters","Monday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Lamartine Chelsea,"305 W 29th St, New York, NY 10001, USA",3.4,40.7494827,-73.9961638,"Decent spot for cheap pricing! The bedroom 2A was fine, very small but clean, organized and had AC even though the hook on the wall was completely unhinged. The bathrooms were great, very clean! We felt like the hostel was quiet and not generally noisy at night. Felt very safe staying here for the weekend. I booked a single room with twin since I was traveling alone. Had a carry on and a backpack and got to stay on the 2nd floor. The shared kitchens and bathrooms were in great shape, but the bedroom felt a little rough. Security was great since everyone had their own assigned door codes for their room and the front door. Very convenient location for walking and taking the trains. Good location, poor service, cant get a hold of staff. You have to go down to the front door and buzz the main entrance buzzer to locate a member of staff for ANY amenity. They say to email but I emailed 4 days ago and no one has even replied. Granted I got half of my query attended to 1hr after trekking down to front door for assistance. For the amount paid I expect more than a thin bed sheet and some airplane blanket that doesnt even cover one person Im 53 for reference thankfully I was only one person who stayed in the double room. The bathroom is clean very clean and done so regularly. However the room. The carpetrug is dirty like grimy  needs a power wash clean or to be thrown I had to wear slippers at all times because even the wood floor hasnt even been swepthoovered. The metal net draw for storage was disgusting as well as the headboard. I firmed staying in the room because atleast the bed sheets were clean but the heating didnt work so I also had to use the towels on top of the sheets to keep me warm. Staff are nice and helpful to an extent. There are 8 hair dryers and only one iron that doesnt work. Thats about all I can say as I didnt utilise the rest of the communal areas.
I would advise to have a separate area for luggage. But general security into the hostel isnt too bad. No code no access.
Bear in mind it gets noisy if your room is by the main road so ear plugs help. Also dont bring big heavy luggage as the stairs are long and narrow and there is no elevator. Also probably not much room the put them if your in a room as small as mine was. Great location for the price. If you're looking for a place to stay for an event at MSG, this is perfect. We booked the smallestcheapest room just because we don't need much space, but when we got there they upgraded us because we were staying for 4 nights, which we were super thankful for. I feel like the people leaving negative reviews forget that this is a hostel and not a hotel with around the clock service and privacy. I would absolutely stay again  Perfect location to be in the heart of NYC without the high price!  Ann does a wonderful job keeping the place clean and tidy. Shared bathrooms but there are several on each floor and guests are respectful of others. Bring your own toiletries or buy them at CVS a block away. There is luggage storage available and fees and expectations were given upfront. Three floors of rooms and very secure. I would stay again!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Would recommend for first time travellers, or anyone who is open minded and wants to find an experience like no other!!

Hostel - Chrystie Street,"81 Bowery, New York, NY 10002, USA",3.9,40.7167511,-73.9955319,"Let me be honest
This place is not the Ritz Carlton. And you know it. It has got weak wifi, and a couple other little things that tend to mildly annoy people...
But, for the price that you pay it is a very nice place, with a good location and available hosts! Good food and bed Room was clean We stayed at this hostel with two friends. We had a shared apartment a few blocks from the hostel. The location is great at the foot of the subway, and serves all places in New York very quickly.

I think the value for money is unbeatable 870 per week for three, however at this price don't expect great luxury, the room is quite small, a double bed and a bunk bed, there are few places for suitcases, the common areas are small, just a kitchenentrance of less than 10m and a bathroom which is just right when the apartment is fully occupied 8 people can stay at the same time. We were lucky enough to be alone 5 nights out of 7 which didn't bother us.

The rooms are not clean, the cleaning was not done during our stay and the trash cans have not been emptied since the previous travelers...

However, we recommend it for those on a small budget, who do not necessarily pay attention to cleanliness. A low quality hostel, although it has a lower price than the average, it is obviously what you pay for, it is good for sleeping, but it is quite small and not very well maintained.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

They kept my luggage through my trip, filtered water is always available.

Mostly tranquil and relatively cheep in crazy NY.

The hosts are ready to help you.
I left my skin cream which was bit a crucial for me, however, they politely sent me it without any charges.
I know its unusual hospitality and kindness.
I can swear they are not desperate to take money from you. Prime location in the heart of New York City. Ideal for getting you anywhere you would like to visit in the city. For value for money, I would argue that it is certainly the top choice barnone that you will find. The owners have clear communication, responsive, and try to help you with your stay. Have stayed for several days, and if the chance to visit ever arises, I would stay with them again. Five stars out of five stars. I am a returning customer who have been using this wonderful place at least for over 10 years as a solo traveler to stay.
I stayed there whenever I visit NYC .
Its a great location 3 blocks from the amtrak and Penn stations  with affordable prices and service is just awesome. Especially Alex and  his respect towards visitorscustomers is awesome. Very relaxed atmosphere. They have lots of fruits and other items to snack on all day. Cute individual rooms very safe. You have the key to your locked pod.
The bathrooms are always kept clean.
They help you keep your baggage for free pending when you are ready to go and catch your flight On August 19, 2024, I dropped my bags off, before taking the train to the U.S. Open. Three hours later, I received a phone call that my Dad had passed away in Chicago. I went back to pick up my bags and explained the situation and they let me cancel my 3 nights I had booked. They were were very kind and compassionate in my time of need. I have stayed there before, and will continue to stay there during my future visits. I would highly recommend staying there while in NYC. Though my stay here was brief. I would have no problem if I had to spend additional time here.

I've stayed in a fair share of Hostels based here in New York, Germany and Poland but this one was definitely the best and most accommodating.

With the cubical rooms it provides the privacy I was looking for. The room is compact sure, but it was comfortable and very safe! I kept my baggage here as I explored and not once did it feel at risk.

Everyone I met was friendly and the rest roomwashrooms were easily accessible and well kept.

If you're looking for an affordable stay in New York for a singular party, I'd recommend this any day!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Q4 Hotel New York City,"29-09 Queens Plaza N, Long Island City, NY 11101, USA",3.7,40.7499046,-73.9374619,"This place does well because theres not much competition in New York. I found the staff to be friendly enough and very efficient. The facilities are very basic Im talking no blockout curtains, no individual lamps or charging points, and not even curtains that fully blocked out the light into the room! Yes its noisy  the train noise didnt bother me, as its kind of a therapeutic sort of black noise, but the noise coming from reception did bother me. I had to ask the staff to turn the music off at 11pm, which they happily did, but this shouldnt need asking. For the price I would not return. The location was convenient and the prices were lower than other hostels but the bathrooms were so dirty and unsanitary that unless they take this feedback and start cleaning them properly, I do NOT recommend anybody stay here for health and safety reasons. The showers were covered in scum and really awful mold, and there are no excuses except for that they are not cleaning them at ALL. Staff was also rude and treated me like a burden when I asked them for toilet paper and help with my keycard stopped working. Please do better. Pretty good hostel! A little noisy with the trains but if you bring earplugs its alright. Bathroom couldve been cleaned better. And they only give you one towel to use I stayed 4 days which I found frustrating. Nonetheless, cheap and good location to take the train downtownuptown NYC. the hostel itself is lovely! its just a shame that lots of the staff are rude and unhelpful. i genuinely have never had a problem with hostel staff, and its a shame that the ones working here are clearly not invested.
also very noisy at night with the subway nearby.
i would recommend looking for another hostel to spend the night and give your money and time to! If you do plan to sleep here for the night. For me it was definitely worth every penny. I stayed Thursday night June 6. The bunk beds are nice and clean, bathroom clean, you get your own locker and amazing dinning room kitchen. They give you a towel and a bed sheet. Bed sheet was ok. This area has everything, a lot of markets and food options around the area. You can hear the trains but barely.

East Harlem Hostel,"157 E 115th St, New York, NY 10029, USA",4.3,40.7980297,-73.9416652,"Room was alright. Small but the bed was comfortable and enough room for two. There were mice droppings in the bathroom 

The location was a bit sketchy. There were just lots of addicts around the metro stop at night. I didnt feel comfortable to stay out late, which meant we couldnt do certain activities during the trip.
If youre looking for a cheap place to stay in Manhattan this is fine though! I wouldnt recommend it for women traveling alone. Other wise the room wasnt bad for the price! I had a private room with a bathroom for context. I enjoyed the minimalism of the space  it was perfect for a trip that was going to keep me out in the city most of the day anyway. The location off the subway was very convenient. There were numerous shops, restaurants, and pharmacies within walking distance. For the hosteling crowd, this was a a nice quiet place to stay. This is a great price and value for your money especially for New York, the hostowner is always ready to reply to your messages and inquiries. Next to a metro station and has a cute small radio for each room as entertainments and it's super clean too. A quiet and beautiful place  I spent 3 nights in this Hostel and honestly I recommend it! The place is very clean, the rooms are quiet, the bed was big and comfortable even though the room is small, the shared bathroom and toilet were also very clean and we didn't have a problem for availability because there is one bathroomtoilet for only 4 rooms per floor. The guest service was also very responsive by email and tried to do their best to respond to my requests. We regularly receive emails from guest service during the stay which was very pleasant and practical. Furthermore, the hostel is located 1 minute walk from the subway which provides very good connections to the center of New York. When I arrived I was also worried because I had seen the comments about the crackheads in the street coming out of the metro station and honestly it was very impressive the first time we saw them but I think they are harmless and I never felt unsafe. Finally, there are plenty of small shops where you can buy snacks and have a coffee nearby. I would not hesitate to recommend this Hostel!

Reservation Resources,"360 W 30th St, New York, NY 10001, USA",3.9,40.7504554,-73.997641,"The location of this place is just perfect! You can walk to nearby attractions like Vessel, high line, etc. The subway station is also closeby.

The rooms were clean  well equipped with basic amenities like fridge, cooking stove, etc. However no panspotsdishes are provided. The checkin was smooth, they had provided all the details over mail beforehand.

The bathroom  toilet were shared as mentioned. We stayed here for 3 nights over the weekend  always found these to be clean  available.

The only drawback was WiFi, we stayed in apartment 10  never got stable Wifi signal.

I would recommend staying here if you are on a budget. Highly recommended considering the location. The room was as I had anticipated  it was clean and quite spacious, just as I expected. The shared bathroom and shower were in line with what was mentioned when I made the booking.

The issue I encountered was with the checkin process. I arrived late at night due to my flight's schedule. Upon my arrival, there was nobody present in the apartment to assist with checkin. Instead, they had left the keys in a lockbox, which I found impossible to open following the provided instructions. During my stay, I had to assist two other individuals who were facing the same problem, indicating that this is a recurring issue.

I was quite disappointed by the checkin experience at the guesthouse. When you arrive in a new city late at night, especially with limited phone connectivity, you would expect a more welcoming and accommodating checkin process from the hotel.

Despite this checkin hiccup, the room itself met my expectations and was wellsuited for my stay in New York. Good location, in walking distance to several subway  train stations and close to Midtown Manhattan.

Booking quite intransparent, no address was indicated and also no cancellation conditions or room amneties.

Checkin was quite confusing, first I was told that someone would be waiting for me, but instead, after waiting more than 20 minutes at midnight at the front door in the cold and alone as a woman, I was told that the keys are in a keybox ready to be picked up. Also, with no data plan for the US, writing text messages back and forth for clarification was not optimal.

Appartment itself was a bit run down, but mainly clean and also quiet. WiFi was very unstable, another minus.

I would not come back, however if you are looking for a centrally located budget place and you are not reliant on a fast internet connection, this place is suitable. Clean and cheap minimal room in crown heights. Very close to subway 3 and 4 line and a commercial strip. Would recommend if you are doing Brooklyn on a budget. thanks! The rooms are large also the location is very close to the Crown HtsUtica Av stop of Subway 4,  35min40min from Grand Central.

Rostel,"160 E 116th St, New York, NY 10029, USA",2.8,40.7982097,-73.9413026,"Warning bed bugs! I do not recommend staying here. The bedrooms can only be locked from the inside, meaning that you cannot leave valuable stuff in your room when leaving the rostel no safe in the room. Sheets were not cleaned. There were tiny bloodstains on the sheets. After a day we found that there were bed bugs. We had to leave to a hotel. After calling the owner we finally got the full amount back after first being asked to stay at their other place in brooklyn with worse google reviews! We had to clean all our clothes with hot water and clean our suitcases which we eventually threw away. Bed bugs may not sound like a big deal, but you do not want to take those bugs home with you! The worst accomodation in my life! Never ever go here. The hotel is filled with bed bugs. I had to throw away my luggage and lots of clothes. The hotel itself is nasty, it stinks and you had to climb two flights of stairs to arrive. You cannot lock the room and so your luggage isn't safe. The grocery man outside knew the numbers to unlock the front door so you can only guess who also knows. PLEASE DONT GO. The area isnt safe, the room is filthy and the hotel owner isn't the nicest. First this is a Hostel not a Hotel. I wasnt too sure about booking this place after reading the reviews. But honestly I would stay here again. The location was perfect. Subway access just around the corner. Easy to find, the person in charge was very nice. She let us drop off our bags before check in time which is 4pm. Then let us check in early at 1230pm. Theres 2 floor levels we were in the 3rd level. The only disadvantage is theres no elevator. Going up the stair when tired can be annoying. But thats the only thing stoping me from giving this place a perfect score. The room was really nice. Yes u have to share a restroom with 2 other rooms. But we never saw anyone in our floor. It has a kitchen which was convenient to warm up our left overs. I took pictures and I wish I could post them. But If ur looking for something offordable I recommend this place. Stayed here for 2 nights and it was nice. It is an apartment, not a hotel. It's also a self check in service. They sent me an email with the self check in instructions but you could also call the number. I had thought that the shared bathroom would be disastrous but it wasn't..the two other guests didn't even arrive as there are 3 rooms so I pretty much had the place to myself...I think there are more apartments on the second floor but I was on the first..The only problem I had were the stairs and I don't even call it one, it's just that it's steep to climb up. But for the price I paid to stay for two nights compared to actual hotels this place is a steal. You get a key to go in the apartment and also a closet key.Your room door can't be locked from the outside but the inside....you also have a key to the closet where you can lock your valuables when you're gone for the day

You should definitely stay at this place.

P.s  to find it, it's to the right of the beauty supply store. To those who plan to stay in this horrible place with terrible service.
This is absolutely not a hotel even though all the websites saying 3 stars hotel.
  I made a reservation but never stayed because i never experience a frightful place like this before.
 Took me a long time asking people around about this place. Finally found the entrance but had to do selfcheck in through a scary and creepy stairs with the stinky hallway.
 I never see my name on the door as it suppose to after you reserved.
 i canceled and never stayed because i think this place is like for hooker and their customers.

At the very last moment, I received an email stating that there was a water main break and that the reservation was cancelled and no charges or penalties will be accessed due to the inconvenience. I was also told that I would receive a full refund. Okay fine although Im now short over 800. Problem is, I never received an email confirmation saying that a refund was processed. I have been calling to speak to a representative to confirm it has at least been processed. Everytime I finally get someone on the phone and state the problem, Im placed on hold and the line is conveniently disconnected. I then try to call again to be sent to voicemail and to leave a message so some can reach me within a 15 minute period. I never receive a call back.

There was no way to fit the group of 3, and I had to book another hotel last minute. Stay away from this place and find somewhere reliable! This hotel needs to post on their site that they do not have an elevator. After booking and seeing this information from a post on another website we called and asked if there is assistance to get to the upper levels where our rooms were and were told an employee is ""sometimes"" there to help us getting up the stairs... Once we realized this we attempted to cancel our reservation weeks out from the booked dates and they refused to refund us 100 even though we do not have a choice but to change where we stay. Incredibly poor customer assistance overall through this process. Now we've lost money and are scrambling last minute to find another hotel within an even smaller budget. I will actively be turning away my friends, family, and company away from this establishment for the lack of warning of no elevator as well as not making an any refund exception for our situation. Zero heart. A good place for the price. Plenty of room and the showers were hot. It was clean and having a little kitchen was a nice touch. Close to the subway and restaurants.

The room was not exactly a suite as advertised  it was a basement room with both windows blocked off with heavy blankets. So no city views, nor views at all.
There were several large pipes running through the room, and every time someone used the bathroom or turned the water on upstairs, we would hear a loud noise.
No blanket was provided  we found this out late at night and since didn't manage to contact anyone, we had to look for one in a closet in the hallway.
Finally, there was a sauna but no instructions were initially given, so we couldn't use it the first night instructions were given on the second day. Definitely a home away from home. This house is big and beautiful, has an Asian theme. Stood at the Garden Suite, has a private hot tub and private back yard. Ron and Aubrey were excellent hosts, very helpful and informative. Will be visiting again, dont hesitate and book your stay! What an amazing place! Ron, Aubrey and Celica are the epitome of helpful, polite, friendly and welcoming hosts  nothing was too much trouble. The building is a fantastic piece of Harlem history, tastefully modernized without losing any character. Our room was warm and spacious, and very comfortable. Its a great, safe location for getting into Manhattan too. Stayed here for business. I needed a place close to Columbia University and this place was my best choice for a late booking. This is a brownstone converted to a boutique hotel. It is best described as immaculate with historical shabby chic. My room was about the size of a traditional hotel room. The bathroom was slightly smaller. The fixtures in the room are beautiful. I got a room facing the front allowing me to hear the sounds of the city. I used the kitchen to eat a meal I brought from outside. The caretaker is very warm and accommodating. The manager is about business, she helped me through a billing problem with care. The police station is right on the avenue and there are beat police walking all over this neighborhood. It might scare some of y'all but it's safe.

Harlem has a couple of traditional hotels but stay here if you want a little flavor of Harlem life.  Tons of good eats to include vegetarian just walking distance away. NYC Subway A and D lines are a 8 minute walk. Apollo theater is a 6 minute walk. Columbia University is a 1015 minute walk. Very quaint and homey BB, owners were very nice and helpful. The room had no working ac but otherwise very nice would be nice to have a tower fan at least. Provided small snacks and drinks in the kitchen and the place was clean. It is very homey, dont expect a hotel. Great if you want a historic, real experience in Harlem. Just a few blocks from the express line so well connected to the rest of NYC as well. They provide a breakfast coupon to a nice little cafe that has great food. People will be out on the street for much of the daynight but relatively quiet for NYC. Great vibe to the neighborhood, safety has been a concern for a few reviewers, but doesnt seem unsafe at all, feels like locals actually live in the neighborhood. Dont expect a lower Manhattan experience. Well lit streets with people out enjoying the night overall wonderful place to stay, would highly recommend if youre looking for a quaint authentic experience, felt like I actually lived there for a couple days with a few additional amenities.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM

West 119th B&B,"115 W 119th St, New York, NY 10026, USA",4.5,40.8045339,-73.949052,"We stayed here for 4 nights on our travels to NYC! We loved how spacious and clean the apartment was and how helpful William is. The location to the subway station was brilliant easy 5 minute walk along the main road. The apartment was very convenient for us we loved it.
We managed to see law and order being filmed at the top of the road which was an unexpected delight. We will definitely be returning on our next trips to new york. Thank you William  We stayed at the BB for 6 nights and really liked the spacious and tidy rooms Garden room. Close to both East and West subway lines. And the North side of Central Park within walking distance. Cafe Latte great and relaxt place to enjoy our breakfast. Really recommend this place and would come back anytime!
William, the owner of the BB, is a very friendly and helpful host. Very reachable in case of questions.
The area with coffee machine, microwave etc is outside the room in the hallway, for the use of guests in both rooms. That wasnt clear to me based on the website. The room itself has a fridge and water cooker. We made ourselves an easy dinner in the room one night. Stayed in June last year and had a great experience, big room, big shower, clean and easy to get to subway. Lots of good food nearby. Would come again. Just got home after staying here with a friend for 5 days.  What a phenomenal experience!  We did not expect such spacious, comfy, luxurious accommodations.  Walking distance to Central Park  less than 5 minutes from the Subway.  And I dont have enough nice things to say about our host, William!  All of my expectations were exceeded...definitely planning on booking here again the next time I visit! I will start off by saying I did not actually get to stay at West 119 BB. My reservation was cancelled and I was refunded but NEVER notified.  Unfortunately I didn't find this out until 4 days before my labor day wedding.  The owner claimed he emailed me, I am still waiting for him to forward me this so called email. He also tried to tell me we spoke about this already. That was the 1st time we had ever spoken. He had refunded me completely which I  appreciate but left me and my bridesmaids stranded and scrambling to find an affordable place. It was an extreme inconvenience because as he told me he was having people over. I had booked this over a month in advanced.  I had reached out to him by replying to my confirmation email multiple times that week  asking questions about check in with no response.  So moral of the story make sure you CALL HIM and confirm your stay. I was extremely disappointed, was really looking forward to staying in the garden room and being in close proximity to so many things. Instead I ended up in a hotel in Yonkers which was very nice but not very close.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE...THIS REVIEW WILL TAKE A MINUTE

I had the pleasure of staying at this stunning brownstone 9222492724 in the heart of Historic Harlem, and it was everything I could have hoped for and more! Arriving totally stressed about the task ahead of me, Kellyn, the owner, was incredibly gracious, making me feel welcome and was very responsive to any questions that I had.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was blown away by the elegant charm of the space. The brownstone itself is a perfect blend of classic architecture and modern comforts, with high ceilings, gorgeous woodwork, and stylish decor that made my stay truly special.

The room was immaculate, spacious, and cozy, and had a peaceful vibe. Kellyn's attention to every single detail from the bedding, lighting, and fixtures, room layout to the shower curtains, was impeccable!!

The location is unbeatableon a quiet, treelined street just a short walk to the culture, restaurants, public transportation and arts and culture Harlem is known for.

This BnB is truly a gem! If you're looking for a unique and authentic experience in one of NYCs most historic and culturally rich neighborhoods, this is the place to stay. I can't wait to return!

I left NYC feeling restored, uplifted, and cared for.

I would be remiss if I did not mention,  Mariela, the housekeeper
and to thank her for all the hard work and care she put into making my stay so wonderful. The room was always clean, and I could tell that she took great pride in what she did and made all the difference in creating such a warm and welcoming environment.

Your hard work does not go unnoticed, and it truly added to my incredible experience there.

THANK YOU, KELLYN  MARIELA.  Wishing you all the best, and I hope to return soon!

Linda Stayed here as we booked late our trip so was one of the few hotels leftover in manhattan.
Location is not great, pretty dangerous for my taste. We tried to never come back later than 9pm due to the area.
Rooms were big and nice, really comfortable mattresses and good laundry services. But bathroom needs some renovation.
We could hear often other guest around in other rooms as well.
Owner or property manager, whoever the lady that checked us in was, seemed fine, nothing bad or good to say about her. Explained us how to move around the area and what to do.
If the price would be lower, I would advise others to say here. At this price, if booked early, there are better locations and hotels in manhattan. THE WORST PERSON I HAVE MET IN MY LIFE!
This was the second time we stayed with harlem grand because the location was perfect for us. BUT we definitly should not have come back here. The owner Kellyn accused us both times we stayed there of smoking in the room wich we DID NOT! We were ghosted the first time but i had no energy to get the caution back and i thought, this was just a horrible mistake. Well i was very naive because Kelly had the same gameplan this time!!!! Get more creative Kellyn because its obvious, you do that to a lot of guests! Dont you feel ashamed? well this time I will take this case futher, you will hear from my lawyer. nice little accomodation thats pretty good for the price. we had a very nice room, it was clean and everything worked. wifi was okay too. Location is okay, you can get to downtown manhattan in like 20minutes. No major complaints, I'd come here again. We had such a great experience! The host was incredibly sweet  so helpful when it came to informing us how to get around NYC. Super clean, quiet and the rooms were beautiful! Great location...you can just hop on the A train and get anywhere in the city so that was super convenient! Super safe location, no issues...just with anywhere be aware of your surroundings. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay! We will definitely be back!","Monday: 1:00 AM – 12:59 PM

Incentra Village Guest House,"32 8th Ave, New York, NY 10014, USA",4,40.7378878,-74.004182,"This place is a spacious, quirky and friendly refuge located in the heart and soul of Greenwich Village. We had a great time and the staff made us feel like we were visiting family who have a very nice house!.

The hotel is located near so many great cafes, restaurants, several cute local parks and bars. Youre a short walk to anywhere or a cheap Uber wherever.

We booked the Stonewall suite which was down 2 floors into the basement. It is HUGE!! Theres 2 queen size beds, a double shower, a mini kitchenette with a microwave, fridge, theres a table and 4 chairs, a giant tv, and plenty of furniture to store your things and put your stuff on.

My sister in law and nephew stayed in a different suite and they also had a spacious unit with a living room, fridge, pullout couch and a small loft upstairs with the queen bed.

The staff were so wonderful and helpful. We met 3 of them over the weekend and everyone was very friendly.

I had no issues with having a friend stay in my room the first night and then I asked to change the sheets the next night because I had senior aged parents join me. The staff were very nice about that request too.

Theres a 58 cleaning fee which I paid upon arrival. Its also adults only no kids under 10 which I actually really like. My teenage nephew stayed there and that was fine with the house rules. Pros  great, welcoming and helpful staff, quiet, great tvs, roomy by NYC standards, excellent AC and location! Kitchenette very convenient.
Cons  interiors badly in need of deep clean, fresh paint, better furniture stained old couch, broken decorations, not antiques and thread bare linens seethrough quilt. Shower floor tiles grimy. I found the images online to be deceiving. I love historic buildings and understand their quirksthis was just disappointingmet needs at best. My daughter and I enjoyed our stay in the Washington suite just before Christmas. Absolutely loved the area and would return. The quirkiness of the hotel was reminiscent of an arts and crafts style house I inhabited in my 20s. We would return. Easy access to transportation and very safe neighborhood even during early  morning and night. Waiting for a respond of the hotel since 1 month, because they charged me under the wrong name and therefore I paid too much!

Rooms are good, but charging too much is ridiculous!!! 3 night stay during September.  Website great.  Arrival communication great.  The Tabor Room is spacious and well appointed.  Floor was dirty.  Beds creaked terribly every time you roll over but mattress and linens were fine.  Entryway was filthy.  Liked the private entrance but the stairs are narrow and steep so small suitcases are better.  Have to pay for all nights upon arrival so we couldn't have changed hotels if we wanted to.  The location is wonderful if you want to feel like a ""local"".  Took in River Hudson Park, 911 Museum, Washington Square, Comedy Underground.  Easy access to subway.  No one around for Saturday checkout.  Likely to stay here again because of the 2 twin beds.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM
