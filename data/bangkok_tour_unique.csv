The Grand Palace,"Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok 10200, Thailand",4.5,13.7498558,100.4915765,"This is a must visit for anyone in Bangkok. It's just an awe inspiring place to wander around and see the sights of the different temples and buildings, there's just so much to see. Do make sure you have read the dress code rules before going, in particular make sure you are wearing long pants no exceptions apart from children, you can buy a pair at the entrance for 200 baht but they are not very comfortable! It can also get very hot and crowded so make sure you've packed lots of water and wear lots of sunscreen. Extremely beautiful temple! However it is very touristy, personally i prefer the less crowded places. But if you don't mind crowds and photos full of people you don't know, it's the perfect place. There are traditional Thai outfits that people are renting and wearing, which are very beautiful. It's crazy hot here. My friends and I showed up around 11, and it was packed. But it was cool checking out all the historic buildings in Thailand. Everyone was super friendly, and I even got to meet some people from Vietnam!  A must see. Some will say that it is very luxurious, wonderful, magical. Others will say eclectic. Anyway, it's a must visit. It is forbidden to wear shorts or a short skirt, but you can buy pants at the exit three times cheaper than at the entrance. A free umbrella and guided tour are available. Enjoy! Its a good place to visit if you havent been to any of the Asian castles of that type. It provides you with a huge contrast with e.g. European style castles. Good to visit once, but to me going back is hardly an option and also going here would not make much sense if you have been to a similar place before in Bangkok or other similar Asian cities. However, this castle cover it all if you havent been to any of those and you are selecting the one to go first time. The decoration and the shape of the buildings is very interesting, as well as large paintings over the whole walls. Overall a borderline 5 stars to me, mainly due to the contrast it provides compared to European architecture and culture","Monday: 8:30 AM – 3:30 PM

Plenty space for a picnic or exercise. Personally, it is my favourite spot to watch the sunset and boats cruising on the river. In the evening there is a chance to practise dancing with local people  and listen to the music . Can't wait to go back there. It's one of my favourite spots in Bangkok . This is one of the best places in Thailand around khosan road. It has no entrance and the place is amazing. Peaceful and beautiful park. You can sit for sometimes doing your things and thinking about the plan what to do in Thailand. Its really wonderful place. The fort has different weapons and it shows how they were kept the city in ancient times. And its very close to the river and it has a great view with that. I recommend this place to anyone stays around khosan road. Nice little fort along the riverside with the park. I had the chance to see it at night time but I must revisit during the daytime. It looks like it could be a very incredible view overlooking the river and the modernday bridge. A tranquil park. Which is a rarity in a manic place like bangkok.

Lots of benches and a cool breeze of the river provides a welcome break Small fort near Khao san road for a quick walk or a river view. Can click some good pictures with a beautiful backdrop of the river and bridge .

The Temple of the Emerald Buddha,"QF2V+M34, Na Phra Lan Rd, Khwaeng Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand",4.7,13.7516435,100.4927041,"A beautiful place with lots of gold. The actual Buddha is much smaller than expected, but still worth seeing. I particularly liked the artwork on the walls. There were fans in the building and it was much cooler than outside which was nice.

However it was SO busy when we went it, was almost too busy. There were people everywhere pushing from all directions. It was also very hot.

Cool place, but make sure you GO EARLY. Id also recommend booking your tickets in advance online so you can beat some of the longgggg queues. Commonly known in English as the Temple of Emerald Buddha, the temple located within the grounds of the Grand Palace it is regarded as the most sacred Buddhist temple in Thailand and it enshrines the highly revered Buddha image meticulously carved from a single block of jade.
There are so many beautiful intricate details and ornaments but you should know its extremely crowded.
I didnt quite enjoy the experience itself because of the heat and crowds but its a must visit when in Bangkok.

Note Be aware youd need to wear long items of clothing covering shoulders and below the knees The site houses a historical Jade Buddha, though photography is unfortunately not permitted inside the temple itself. However, photos are allowed in the surrounding area. The grounds are clean, with clear signage, making it easy to navigate. The only downside is the somewhat high ticket price of 500 baht per adult. Other than that, theres little to complain about.

Pro
History and culture value
Clean
Clear sign

Cons
Tickets are expensive The temple is very holy and sacred. It is definitely an architectural treasure of Thailand. It worth the visit when you go to the Grand Palace. It is a must visit site.
Please buy the tickets online in advance to avoid queues. Admission fee for foreigners is 500 baht which includes the Grand palace and a couple of museums. This is a must see in Bangkok, although  the Emerald Buddha is very small its still a beautiful temple complex. Closes at 330 PM and its very crowded, people taking pics everywhere so its hard to move around as you have to wait to let them take their pic!","Monday: 8:30 AM – 3:30 PM

Not much here, a short span of a wall and a tower, but it gives you an idea of what Thai fortifications must have been like in the past. There is also a small park next to the fort, along the canal, which has just enough trees to provide some much needed shade.  the fort is not that impressive but its on the way to Wat Saket. Relaxing park. Beware of local guys, they look friendly but they try you to spend money. You can not climb the fort, but you can walk around the park created within the fort and walls. There are a lot of this little Forts painted in white around the inner city. Often surrounded with a beautiful park or garden. Nothing to see, nothing inside, just a nice place with some canons. Nice little area to walk around, well looked after. Was smaller than I thought though. Took us less than 5 mins to walk through. We saw a komodo dragonalligator looking creature having a swim.

The aquarium features stunning natural tanks filled with a diverse array of fish and marine life, making it a captivating environment for young explorers.

The interior design is beautifully arranged, enhancing the overall experience with vibrant colors and engaging displays. The glass boat ride was a highlight, allowing us to glide through underwater tunnels surrounded by majestic sea creaturesan unforgettable way to connect with the marine world.

Additionally, the 5D movie experience was thrilling, immersing us in an interactive adventure that was both entertaining and educational. Overall, Sea Life Aquarium offers a fantastic day out for families, combining fun with learning in a breathtaking setting. Highly recommended! very beautiful, many species of marine life, children really enjoy it.
The shark tunnel was the highlight of my visit. It felt like I was transported to a vast ocean when I walked through the transparent tunnel, surrounded by countless sharks of all sizes. The shimmering lights created a magical atmosphere, making me feel like I was swimming alongside these gigantic creatures SEA LIFE Bangkok Ocean World is an extraordinary and highly recommended destination. The wide range of marine life on display is both stunning and captivating. Each section of the aquarium is wellorganized, making it easy to navigate and explore the various aquatic species. I was particularly impressed by how seamless the transitions between the different sections were. Another highlight for me was the 4D show, which added a fun and immersive experience to the visit. Overall, its a great place to enjoy and learn about marine life in a beautifully structured environment. Visiting SEA LIFE Bangkok with my young daughter was an exceptional experience. This aquarium offers a captivating adventure for children and adults alike. The variety of marine life on display is both extensive and impressive, featuring everything from vibrant fish and graceful rays to majestic sharks and playful sea turtles.

The exhibits are thoughtfully designed to be both educational and engaging, with interactive elements that are perfect for young kids. My daughter was particularly enchanted by the mesmerizing underwater tunnel, which provides a panoramic view of marine life swimming all around. The handson activities and touch pools added an extra layer of excitement and learning for her.

The facility is wellmaintained, and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable, enhancing the overall experience. SEA LIFE Bangkok's commitment to conservation and education is evident throughout, making it not only a fun day out but also a valuable learning opportunity for children.

For families visiting Bangkok, SEA LIFE Bangkok is a highly recommended destination. It offers a delightful and enriching experience that will leave both children and parents with lasting memories.

The experience starts with a fantastic 20minute 3D show, complete with moving chairs that give you a reallife feeling.

After the show, you can explore the aquarium, which features an incredible variety of sea creatures. From sharks to stingrays, jellyfish to sea snakes, you can see it all up close. You can also enjoy popcorn and Coke, and there's even a free photo opportunity.

One tip I highly recommend buying your tickets in advance, as they dont accept cash at the entrance. It's best to purchase your tickets at least a day before your visit to avoid any hassle.

Overall, Sea Life Bangkok Aquarium offers an amazing and immersive experience for visitors of all ages.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Good ambience, average food that you can get anywhere else in Bangkok. Worth a onetime visit though and easily accessible through express boat service on Chao Phraya river 500baht per person. Worth the money for us as tourist. Not sure about the citizen as not much people are queueing up except for tourist. Maybe it is considered pricey to them. 3 rounds only, maybe around 15mins20mins? I took free shuttle boat from Sathorn Pier. And prior that I took BTS to Saphan Taksin BTS Station. Around 5mins walking. No escalator or lift. Only flight of stairs. So travel light please. Boat is every 30mins. 4pm till 1130pm. Please spend some time here. We regret not spending much time due to the crankiness of our kid. But as for you, please spend at least 2 or 3 hours. Lots to see and try! Great place to eat beautiful food as there's plenty of restaurants

Kids will enjoy Really nice place to visit. Price for the ferry wheel ride is a bit too much. It was 500 baht per person for just 15 minutes 3 rounds. But the experience is amazing.  It was a very enjoyable experience, though there wasn't an overwhelming amount to do. I'd recommend pairing it with another activity. It's a bit pricey but worth it overall.

It's a really nice space with replicas of some iconic Bangkok sites like the Giant Swing and Democracy Monument. There is an area called Chinatown with old Chinese inspired architecture. They also have a big food hall with dinosaur statues. It's sort of like a theme park for Bangkok. It was not very busy and felt a bit empty, so I'm not sure when the best time to come is. I visited on 28 Dec Thurs. I think this place has huge potential to be amazing. Obviously a lot of money and effort has been invested here and it looks great. I hope more people will visit more often to create the vibrant atmosphere it needs. Entry to this area is free, the ticket booth is for Siam Amazing Park. Super empty. I couldn't find any shop opened at all.

The cafeteria was pretty much dead too  only a food stall and a drink corner were opened.

Very sad to see a huge amount of investment spent to build a ghost town. Log Flume was by far the best ride and different to any I had been on before. However many rides in the amusement park were closed or not operational. However there was many short queue which was a bonus. The water park was a major let down. 23 of slides closed and not able to use, for the wave pool they didnt even turn on the wave machine and when it claims the title of largest in the world youd think they would actually use it? Pool was also filthy and hadnt been cleaned in a long time.

I waited at my hotel at the indicated time, and they never picked me up. I tried to get a refund through Expedia and they said the vendor declined. I think this company is a scam. Fighting it now with my credit card. I think the photos tell everything you need to know about the place. This Hangover tour was super fun in 2018 but this time was a waste of time and money. They took us to a boring Patpong museum and then a bunch of strip joints. The hosts were 2 young guys who were nice but very quiet and awkward.  We actually requested to end the tour early and left. I do not recommend this tour. My wife and I booked the Hangover tour from Aus not sure of what we were going to experience   It was everything and more.
From the moment we were collected by our tour guide Ayam, we were treated like royalty.  Ayam ensured we had VIP treatment wherever we visited, ensured our safety, and explained the shows and the expectations whilst in the venues.  I cannot rave more highly about this tour.  Thanks Ayam.

King Prajadhipok Museum,"2 Lan Luang Rd, Khwaeng Wat Sommanat, Khet Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10100, Thailand",4.7,13.7561405,100.5064072,"As a person who loves history and a selfproclaimed 'old soul', I have great interest in historial museums because it takes me back in time. I've been meaning to visit King Prajadhipok Museum for quite sometime but laziness  and distance  and someone to go together always hinders me to check it out. Glad to have found someone to go there this time. 

The impression of the museum is very homey for me  for some reason. It's like an old threestorey mansion with deep history and finally the government decided to honor it to house the wonderful journey of life of King Prajadhipok Rama VII. Just an information, the museum was actually built for commercial purposes during King Chulalongkorn's reign and was under the Royal Treasury then Public Works Department before it was registered as a heritage site in modern times.

I am very impressed how the museum walked us through King Prajadhipok's life from childhood until his death at a very young age of 48. As I was browsing the details provided through the walkthrough, I felt so overwhelmed with emotions  happiness, sadness, suspense, intrigue. My brain is imaginative that's why I feel like I was watching a movie of King Prajadhipok's life  from childhood to adulthood, and how the fifth ? child instead became king.

Though his life was full of challenges since young  he was a sickly boy according to the provided historical information  I assumed he had a fulfilling and happy life with his wife  Queen Rambai Barni. As I was looking at their pictures  despite the troublesome days and many intrigues during his reign, it is evident that both of them tried to live a life of happiness. And I am glad to witness their life still at this time.

The museum is free as of October 2024. It is at a prime location and also near some interesting temples too. I highly recommend to those who'd like to have a glimpse and would like to learn a bit about Thailand's history to drop by. The museum is wellmaintained and hopefully will be continued to do so. I cannot express how much I appreciated my visit to King Prajadhipok Museum that I started reading more about Thailand's history and royalties until late night when I returned home. I enjoyed this museum. There was no fee to enter, you just need to fill up a visitor log. There's also free parking at the back if you have a motorcycle or a car. The museum was well laid out and properly curated. I learned so many things about the Siamese Kingdom, King Prahadjipok and his family and how the current government constitutional monarchy was formed.

We were the only tourists so we had the museum to ourselves then there was a group of highschool kids that caught up to us.

If you are looking for something to do to fill in a few hours of your day, I recommend visiting this museum. I had no idea this place existed, i was walking toward the Queens gallery and the museum is located on the adjacent street.
Free to enter, you must look all you belongings, you are only allowed to have you phone in the building, you are free to explore 3 floors on the life of the great uncle? of Thailands current king.
The firstonly? to abdicate the museum explores a really fascinating look at the life a Thai monarch who with 3 older legit brothers shouldn't have been king to begin with.
Im not Thai and went in expecting to be out in 20 minutes, i was there for 90 I love this museum.  See pictures and learn history of  King and Queen Rama VII. The Prajadhipok Museum in Thailand is a hidden gem that offers a deep dive into the fascinating history of King Prajadhipok Rama VII and Thailand's transition to constitutional monarchy. The museum is beautifully curated with wellpreserved artifacts, photographs, and personal items that give visitors an intimate look at the life and reign of the king. The exhibits are informative, wellorganized, and engaging, making it a perfect stop for history lovers. The building itself is a stunning piece of architecture, and the peaceful atmosphere adds to the overall experience. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Thailand's rich history!","Monday: Closed

We did it on a scooter motorcycle, stopping from time to time to take pictures, grab a coffee, or admire a detail, and it was just fine this way. Not that I recommend everyone use a motorcycle in those narrow and mazelike streets unless you're a seasoned and very careful rider.

Hipster as it is, this ancient neighborhood is a great place to hang out, try coffee curiosities, and mingle with fellow artdriven tourists along with locals. As a chocolate expert I can really say its an amazing place to visit and try hot and cold drink chocolate. They have many varieties from different regions which I really appreciate, of course as usual I take always the 100 one because so you can feel the quality of chocolate. Was nice to meet you and may stay in contact if you need help in developing chocolate, the guy who worked there has my number. If you want check IG Taucherlichocolate and also helped some chocolate brands in Thailand Three hours of walking and exploring at Talat Noi, after reading some introduction on this old district in BKK. The street art is not the only drawing factor, the different characters of the cafes was the reason why I was drawn to it. Besides there are many traditional food at very reasonable prices tug at different corners.. hopefully the prices wont triple with more locals and tourists checking out the area. One of the oldest area of bangkok. Very clean  well maintained. The street arts are very beautiful. Perfect place to take good photos. Please check the videos. Nice area in Bangkok to go see. A lot of street art and a lot of motor parts all over the neighbourhood. Many narrow and old alleys to walk around and theres also quite a few restaurants and coffeetea shops.

Bangkok City Pillar Shrine,"Lak Muang Rd, Khwaeng Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand",4.8,13.7525651,100.4940402,"It is one of the key spots in Bangkok where people can make merit and pray for success in business.
The architecture is really nice here.
I also like the way they make the praying more sustainable by asking people not to burn the incense and candles. Just reuse it as part of the ritual. Reduce pollution and use of materials.  Bangkok has so many crafted beautiful architecture, and this is one of them. Locals and buddhist travelers come here to make offering to the shrine. It is conveniently located across the street to the Grand Palace and next to the  Ministry of Defence. You can buy some followers, make offering and do prayers at the side gate entrance building, spire column or the ground floor tent. They also have smll charming plant and flower garden on the side of the Grand Palace direction. I highly recommend  visit. Stunning place!!!  The Pillar that protects the Country of Thailand located near to the Thai Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew and Wat Pho...rarely see tourists go there as it is well known among Thais local. Thai locals believe to visit and pay respect at Bkk City Pillar Shrine at least once a year for luck and prosperity especially after New Years hoilday.  You can buy a flower set few colorful ropes to tie the pillar in the inside for approximately 60 Thai Baht. Instructions will be provided. A very nice highly trafficked site, Buddhist and secular mix.  The city pillars are covered.  The artwork is the gorgeous Thai style.  Dress appropriately.  And yes, worth a visit even after you see the other superb tourist sites next door.","Monday: 6:30 AM – 6:30 PM

Can spend 2030minutes at this point Nice viewpoint, especially during the nighttime to capture lights of the bank across the river and stunning Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan.

But oh my  there are so many people there! It seems impossible to get to the railings because every single free space is taken. Just be mindful of it when visiting. Arun temple with sunset or night light so beautiful. Thailand  One of the most popular spots to take a shot at Wat Arun and its free. Note that theres no parking space available so its better to get here by public transport or walking. Also this location is not for you to cross the river to Wat Arun on the other side of the river. You should go to Thatien pier for that and its only 510 minutes walk away and it costs 5 Bht per person.

Note that there are a lot of Tuk Tuk and taxi drivers nearby on the main road who like to rip off or scam tourists. Just be careful about their offer or try to avoid them if possible. Great place to view wat arun temple. Also perfect for good photos.","Monday: Open 24 hours

During the day, it can feel quite empty, but at night, Chinatown comes alive in all its glory. Its like a fairy tale for extroverts!

Theres something magical about sitting on the street with a beer, soaking in the vibrant atmosphere and the bustling life around you. It truly feels like a different world within Bangkok. I wish I had visited earlier in my trip, but I highly recommend experiencing it! Bangkok Chinatown is a vibrant and bustling area that offers an authentic Chinese cultural experience right in the heart of Bangkok. The streets are filled with colorful shops, street vendors, and delicious food stalls that serve some of the best street food I've ever had. From dim sum to noodles, there's something for everyone!
The atmosphere is lively, especially at night when the neon lights come on, making it an excellent spot for evening strolls and photography. Many traditional shops and markets also sell everything from herbs to souvenirs.

Highly recommend visiting Chinatown, especially if you love exploring diverse cultures and trying new foods! Lively  busy atmosphere out here  youll definitely enjoy the sight of foods! There are many options for you to try depending on your taste bud. Highly recommend to visit during night time. Walking through Bangkoks Chinatown Yaowarat at around 7 PM was an experience like no other! The entire street was alive with energy, vibrant lights, and the aroma of street food filling the air. Everywhere I looked, there were bustling food stalls offering a variety of local delicacies, from freshly made dim sum to the famous seafood and stirfries. The diversity and richness of the flavors were amazing, and it felt like a true culinary adventure.

The atmosphere was buzzing with locals and tourists alike, all enjoying the lively street scenes. Traditional Chinese lanterns lit up the streets, adding a touch of cultural charm. What really stood out to me was how welcoming and safe it felt, even amidst the crowd. The energy was positive, and you could feel the blend of Thai and Chinese cultures in every cornerfrom the food to the temples and the local vendors.

Yaowarat is a mustvisit if youre in Bangkok, especially in the evening when the streets come to life. Whether youre here for food, shopping, or just to soak in the atmosphere, its an unforgettable experience. Highly recommend spending a few hours hereyou wont regret it! Chinatown is a mustvisit while being in Bangkok. It was raining when we were there but it couldn't stop people from flooding the area. The main street of Yaowarat was full of local food vendors.

The processes of minting money and basic economics are covered. Adults may also enjoy the museum. Unfortunately, some of the machines used for learning were not working when I visited. June 2023 One of the best small and stylish community living museum, ever. As far as we know they are governmentrun but services are impeccable packed with most welcoming and utmost knowledgable staff.

Highly recommended. Bang Lamphu Museum is located on Phra Sumen Road, and is walkable from Phra Artit Road.

The museum is quite local but surprising, the space seems to be one of my favorite museum in Thailand. Ticket price for docent to give us a 1 hour tour is only 30 Baht. The tour goes on every half an hour and each tour capacity is around 810 people at max.

Although the tour is based on Thai Language, the caption of some of the archaeological findsitems can be in English Description.

The museum shows us the fascinating story of Banglumphu old days where market selling and its district are what is known for. There's also history learning part on how land was developed from time to time and even how nickelcoin are crafted and used for from the old times.

An absolute wonderful museum that worth every penny. Some of the visitors if hisher family member lives around here during 40s50s will surely inspired by those ""nostalgic feeling"" from start to the end.

Still photos are permitted only. Nice museum which tells you history of Bangkok old town and the old Banglumphu area. They also provide guided tour with good English speaking guide. At the top floor, you can get a good panoramic view of Rama 8 suspension bridge and the old fort nearby. Highly recommend. Awesome little free museum telling stories of the city through its infrastructure! Such as khlongs, walls, forts, and gates. You will get the most value out of the place if you watch all the videos, almost all of them have an English option.","Monday: Closed

Their staff is obviously very good and caring. It is a mustsee place when you come to Bangkok. I also felt that the entry fee was a reasonable rate. It is better to leave around 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  It's more convenient for people to take pictures in the evening. This has been far the best roof top that I have been to, u get 360 views around the city. Every body goes for the sunset, if u would like to get a good spot I suggest going about 23 hours before sunset. This place will get jammed packed with people, they also have a bar on the top for refreshments from water to alcohol. After the sunset it pretty much closes, u will probably spend 3045min trying to get back to the bottom since only so many can fit on the elevator. Totally worth it! Morning visit. Great view of the city. The outside area is just too hot to relax and enjoy it for long. The glass floor area is pretty small compared to similar attractions in other cities. If you've done a glass floor before, skip this one. Lots of seating outside with a little coffee shop. I bet it is quite enjoyable when it's cooler.  For me, I'd just as well go to a rooftop bar to enjoy a good view and drinks. There is a long line to purchase the tickets.
Sometimes the top floor is closed due to rain and lightning risk.
The view is stunning. Really worth the money.
To come out one has to go through a labyrinth of duty free like stores. Wow! This was worth every cent. The view was amazing, the staff were friendly and helpful. We got there early for a 5pm session and were allowed in, unfortunately during our sessions we got a heavy storm, but the staff were well organised, leaving us to stay up the top until the last minute as the rain hit. They then allowed us onto level 74 where we watched all the lights come on in the city. We loved every minute there!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 AM

It's less crowded, allowing for a relaxed experience. The international lunch buffet offers a wide variety of delicious options, satisfying every palate. The water activities in the separate section add to the fun and make it a complete day of enjoyment for visitors of all ages.

Siam Amazing Park in Thailand is renowned for its thrilling roller coasters, including the adrenalinepumping Mega Coaster and the familyfriendly Junior Coaster, offering rides for all thrill levels. Apart from roller coasters, the park boasts a variety of attractions such as water slides, wave pools, and a large artificial beach, ensuring a day filled with excitement and adventure. Very nice amusement park and water park. Good for family with children but basically everyone can enjoy the park. I have been visiting here since childhood and it's always nice to go back and have a good time with friends and family. They have built many new buildings and attractions. I do hope the place will be full with visitors soon. Good one but many rides were closed not functioning. Roller coaster was the best, and slidewheel was good. Big disappointment is that giant drop, 3d theatre and many rides were closed.

Water rides were decent but not many options. The usual ones.

In swimming pool, they didnt turn of the Wave at all. Even after asked, the guard said it wont be turned on. We left early by 3pm dissapointed. Locker facilities were not bad. I recently visited Siam Amazing Park and wanted to share my experience, especially regarding the ""Amazing Adventure"" part of the park. Unfortunately, I found it to be quite a disappointment, particularly if you have kids between the heights of 100cm to 130cm. The park has extremely strict rules on the rides, some of which are very basic and not even that thrilling. As a protective parent, I understand the importance of ageappropriate rides, but the restrictions here seemed excessive. The Log Flume water ride was one of the few thrilling attractions where my kids could join me. However, the experience was marred by a considerable wait time. Although we were initially informed of a 30minute wait, it ended up taking an unexpected 1.5 hours. This delay was not due to long queues or a large crowd, but rather due to slow staff and the limited number of operating boats.

Due to these rules, my kids were left feeling bored, let down, and sad. They could only go on rides meant for infants and little kids, which didn't match their excitement levels. It's disheartening to see a park that is meant to provide fun and entertainment end up making kids feel excluded. I would advise not wasting your time here, as this park seems empty and lifeless for a reason.during a weekend.

Furthermore, I must mention that the staff at Siam Amazing Park weren't very friendly. Their lack of warmth and willingness to assist added to the overall disappointment of the visit. It's important to feel welcomed and valued as a guest, but unfortunately, that was not the case here.

Overall, I can say that my visit to Siam Amazing Park's adventure part was a letdown, particularly for families with kids in the 100cm to 130cm height range. The strict rules further limited the enjoyment. Considering the underwhelming experience and unfriendly staff, I would recommend exploring other options for a more enjoyable family outing. We went there on a weekday morning so there were barely any people but the rides were very fun. Didnt realize there was a huge wavepool in the park so its quite a pleasant surprise though I wish we brought swimming gear.

The buffet was cheap and the foods were okay. ","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM

The rooftop gardens are beautiful and offer great views of the area and nearby Benjasiri Park. Conveniently connected to Phrom Phong station. In simple phrase, it's the Marina bay sands mall for Thailand. The roof top garden is awesome for nice solitary time. The Starbucks ambience was awesome.

The nearest sky train is Bang Wa, from there you can get a taxi as its a bit far to walk.
You can walk around the whole area which runs along the canal and see people painting and making bangles and necklaces. There are lots of eateries and drink stalls. Excellent vibes! Lots of art to take in, all the staff were wonderful and lovely, we chatted about lots of things and even received a free dessert. Lots of activities and opportunities to make your own are and art for sale ranges in price so anyone can purchase! By the river, really calm and peaceful energy  So far the calmest and most artistic place Ive visited in Bangkok. You can make your own braceletnecklace and even paint.
The prices were overall good given that it was located in a super touristy area.
I really liked that the cafe was surrounded by the canal and beautiful floating houses. Creating your own art pieces, bead bracelet or necklace and painting, in the charming old wooden house by the canals. Its a good place to escape from the hectic life in Bangkok. The vibe couldnt be better. Staffs are friendly. Recommend to visit in the morning before the place gets crowded. Dont miss a chance to try Thai tea latte from the cafe. It is a great place for sightseeing with lovely surroundings and many choices of food and snacks. This place offers a variety of art and crafts if you are looking for a place to spend the day in Bangkok.  It is definitely recommended ","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM

But if you cant handle the intensity, its best to steer clear. This is the party central of Bangkok. We went to a pub called Khao San Central which is in the middle of the walking street. Love the energy and vibe of this place. The pricing is so damn good you wont feel like leaving. We went twice to the same pub. You can sit eat and dance.

Night life is also just next to each other. Loud music and plenty of people.
Waiters are standing and waiting for customers, some will even touch you and convince you to sit in their bar.
Definitely for those party enthusiasts.
Many drunkards tourists walking around and dancing.

There is also a street that is more calm and mostly for those who just wants to chill and relax.
Plenty of options.
Recommended just for experience. I enjoyed the market, however, I believe that the shops were pretty repetitive when it comes to food however, it was not as crowded as Chinatown and thats a big plus! The food we had was really good.","Monday: 3:00 PM – 2:00 AM

Walking along the road to other attractive sites is very nice. It's crowded and hectic, but it's interesting. But why does it feel more like Taiwan than the streets of China? Some streets even felt similar to Kaosan Road. There is no single safety personnel who control the streets, so I think it's right to have an onsite patrol agent if it's a place where tourists visit so much. Must visit and have meal there.

Taxi ride from Democracy Monument was 100 bahts 3 or maybe take Tuk Tuk 120150 bahts, which is more fun to get to the market.

The market is rather commercial, I don't feel localmarketvibe... foods and stuff are things you can find anywhere. The food stalls by the canal are not ideal either. The stalls are located along the canal, while the seating is in the middle. It looks packed and uncomfortable, so we didn't eat anything here. Anyway the people were so nice  Vibes are really good , locals selling mango sticky rice, family of musicians playing traditional thai music, children feed fishes  , peaceful atmosphere other than the occasional train rumble. Beware of the tour guides pretending to sell floating market tickets , its a scam! The floating market is that place itself One of floating market in Bangkok, Taling Chan Floating Market. Though it is quite small, but there are plenty of food and Thai dessert. You can enjoy casual eating area along the cannel where you can order varieties of grilled seafood with seasonal prices. If you have time, you can do some excursion by renting private boat charter for 1.20 hour. Even though it's called a market, there are no shops selling anything, and it doesn't feel like a market. It's just a boat ride down a dirty river. There's a 20minute break on the way, and we only eat at the ground market.","Monday: Closed

Restrooms are there and very clean. Very beautiful, ornately carved, boats dating back many years.

Despite crazy hot weather yet noisy street. Temple hall is very quiet and a good place for self meditation. Received a piece of amulet as a gift from monk for blessing.  This place is a good place to meditate because tourist hardly walk into this temple.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 12:00 AM

We spent around 3 hours walking following the map, enjoying the street art, and trying local delicacies in a local cafe. I love how vibrant the streets were. Much better alternative to people like me who do not like or easily get tired shopping. Nice walk to check out the alleys and local street art. Unfortunately it was drizzling followed by heavy rain thus I had to make a detour to Warehouse 30 which is also nearby. This is great for people who like to explore and take their time to roam and take photos. Nothing special. My hostel was only 15 minutes away and I decide to visit. But was not worth if I spent with transport to go there.
Its only a small street with some arts. This is a great spot for anyone who like street art. Also a good starts for starting walk tour around talad noi area Cool area for street art. I think they repaint it from time to time too. Not super big but definitely worth stopping by if you're around the area","Monday: Open 24 hours

Need to take off your shoes. This is a high leg tiny wooden house. Showcasing the history of old times. The guide will show you around the house. Good to visit. A small museum about this part of Bangkok situated in a beautiful old wooden building. Most of the explanations are written only in Thai, though. But, if you speak a little Thai, the extremely friendly caretaker will personally give you a tour of all exhibits... No English Language anywhere. Also Thia writing is left to write with no spaces or punctuation. So Phranakhondistrict.

This is a district museum  is the one of Phra Nakhon district, the central district of Bangkok. Prior to its merger with Thonburi, the Bangkok province was named Phra Nakhon after this central district. The museum is located directly next to the district office on Samsen road. It is therefore close to the popular tourist area of Khao San road.

The museum is in a wooden house in traditional Thai style, the former residence of Phraya Borirak Ratcha , who was a palace guard for King Rama V till Rama VII. In one room in the second floor it has some portrait paintings of the former homeowner.

The other rooms show various exhibits connected with the local history, the traditions of the citizen like local products, like the baskets and other wickerwork as shown in the photo. Worth calling in if you're passing to see a well constructed original Bangkok house. Free entry. Worth visiting, nice heritage place.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM

The Ancient City,"296/1 Sukhumvit Rd, Tambon Bang Pu Mai, Amphoe Mueang Samut Prakan, Chang Wat Samut Prakan 10280, Thailand",4.5,13.5386026,100.6225741,"My partner and I visited on a Monday. Starting from Siam, we took a 45minute train ride followed by a 10minute taxi ride to reach the destination.

The place is expansive, so I highly recommend bringing essentials like an umbrella, water, sunglasses, and an extra shirt as it can get quite humid. They offer a tram service and bikes for getting around, or you can rent a golf cart for more convenience. The tram makes stops at the four major locations, which is more than enough to cover the key sights. We spent about two hours exploring and found it to be a pleasant and efficient way to see everything. Ancient City is a fantastic spot for photography enthusiasts, with many picturesque replicas of Thailands most famous landmarks. Its not as crowded as some of the more popular tourist spots, making it perfect for a peaceful exploration and photo sessions.

One tip for budgetconscious travelers is to buy tickets online, as they tend to be much cheaper compared to buying them at the entrance. However, be prepared for additional charges. The park is quite large, so unless you plan to walk for hours, youll likely need to rent a golf cart, which is an extra cost. Also, some activities and exhibits within the park require separate payments.

Overall, its a great place to immerse yourself in Thailand's culture and history, but it's important to plan for extra expenses beyond the entrance fee. This place is very huge, no exaggeration! Definitely have to rent a golf cart if you want to visit all the sites. For 2 people seats, 350 baht for the first hour, and 100 baht for every next hour. I spent 5 hours in this place using a golf cart, now imagine how long you spend your time without one. My ticket includes a buffet where you can go inside this place. Overall, this place is wonderful, there are a lot of great buildingstemples. Worth every penny. Beautiful place worth every penny. You can roam around the place the whole day and explore the Thai history. Place very instagramable. I would recommend you rent a golf cart specially when the weather is hot. Bicycle is provided free with your entrance ticket. The only problem was the choice of food, it was really limited. Ancient City, located near Bangkok, is a vast outdoor museum with replicas of Thailand's historical landmarks and cultural sites. Its my favorite place for photography even though it can be quite hot outside, the stunning architecture makes the effort worthwhile. The park is huge, so you can spend a whole day exploring. There are also Thai restaurants onsite serving a range of traditional dishes.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Very complicated and I dont know when we can cross they are aggressive!!!
Enjoy! Nothing much significant about this bridge. It serves a good place to take some street photos having monasteries as the beautiful background. It's the good place to shoot in the daylight and also at night time. Since it's a junction of multiple cross roads, one should be careful about the traffic while crossing or shooting in this area.
Apart from this, area is clean and maintained well. Phan Fa Lee Lat is supposed to be a new transport hub because of its constructing metro station MRT supporting the boat pier. Phan Fa Lilat Bridge built by Rama V. Modified many times but the marble poles still remain.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The cafe is super reasonably priced and good. Very relaxed way to spend an afternoon. Perfect for rainy day activity. Very nice exhibition. The meseum shows off many collections of Thai national artists. The cafe was very nice and affordable. We had a great time here, beyond our expectation. A must visit if you enjoy art and are visiting Bangkok. Took us 3 hours to walk through 5 floors of amazing art. Affordable too. MOCA is definitely one of the best museums you can find in Bangkok. With its white and clean interior ambiance, it showcases a plethora of art, especially paintings from numerous artists.

We spent almost half a day here enjoying every piece of art they have. The location may be a little hard to reach by public transport, but it is definitely worth a visit. Great museum, not far from central Bangkok
Easy to go, Use airport link red line or taxi booking app.
Took around 3 hours to enjoy all art and sculpture.
Clean and comfortable.

None the less, I was well received  no entrance fees and a beautifully curated exhibit of Cabinets dating back to various points in Thai history was on display.  If you enjoy slow travel and museums that show something different, you might just enjoy this. Free museum! They have a huge collection of cabinets from various eras.

Its not hard to get to, just less than 10 minutes from the temple. Its at the end of a kind of hidden alleyway just follow Google Maps directionsthey are pretty accurate. I went a bit late, so the light wasnt the best. On the right side of the canal, you can see the sunset. The best time to visit this place is at golden hours to sunset, avoid noon time as it's very hot. You can rent a small boat to go around the river and take photos 200bathperson which is good experience in Bangkok. There is more ppl at this spot on weekend but the queue is not long tho. It's totally free to take photo here. Free admission to this photospot. Just across the river. Sadly, renovations are ongoing. Boat service available at 200bahtperson, mainly for phototaking.

To get here, just follow Google maps. You will cross a very steep bridge and walk around 10mins from Wat Paknam. There are signages around the area clearly displayed. This place looks like a backyard of their residential area. It's hard to go inside the street with your own car since the lane are very narrow. And the boat service is a little bit expensive which is around 200 Baht person. This spot is great to get a photo with some building and with the giant Buddha to get a perspective of the size of the statue. Also, there is a small boat service that operates there where it can take you around the water area for roughly 30minutes. It is a more interesting way to go to the temple and they will slow down in areas to let you get your photos and videos. You can ask to return to the original spot or you can be dropped off at the giant Buddha pier entrance.",no operation time,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment"

It was very interactive. The princess clothing was super and exhibited really well. There is a senior citizens discount which was 80 bahts. This exhibition was on the second floor and photographs were not allowed so the images were taken from the catalog. On the first floor is an amazing exhibition of weaving and design. I was truly inspired by everything I saw. I really appreciate the culture and art of the country. I love fashion, I am interested in fabrics, I am interested in production and design. I really liked the museum. Thank you for such an opportunity to touch this experience. The building is air conditioned and walking in just makes you feel nice after walking under the sun. There was a man standing at the entrance of the building who asked to see the ticket. After I showed it to him, I put it back in my pocket. Unfortunately then I met a woman at the podium inside who also asked to see the ticket. It took me a few seconds to show her my ticket but her tone was rude as I was looking for the ticket.  I suggest they can just put up a sign that tells people to prepare their ticket. Beautiful dresses during the finest era. Her Majesty Queen Sirikits Wardrobe Created by Pierre Balmain were made so exquisitely beautiful. You cant take any photos when inside. You should not miss this on your way out of Grand Palace. Dont forget to collect textile stamps representing their citystate before you leave. batik collection is no longer there the exhibition focuses on clothing work by the queen and then the princess cant take photos of the clothes. you can buy a ticket onsite for just this museum if you dont want to go to the palace 150bht.

Big space and great atmosphere. Variety of foods and restaurants. Recommend for who would like to relax and chill. My favorite night market. Now not as many vendor as before. I miss lot of cosmetic vendor. Sun glasses also much less. Food still ok also cloth and sandal. Though I found a very nice small hand bag A lot of tourists for sure. Went on a Friday night and the place wasnt as filled up but the servers werent paying attention to us once we were seated. Serving time took longer than expected and the serving size wasnt to our liking. There was a lot of miscommunication and it was a frustrating experience.

Food was good but it was unfortunate that we didnt have the experience we wouldve wanted in a night market.

Price was a bit on the expensive side and the servers even added a ""suggested"" tip to our receipt. We refused to give what was suggested and gave some other tip. We wouldve obliged to give what was suggested but we felt the service they have given us wasnt worth that amount. This place has a lot of different restaurants, streetfood stalls, and shopping possibilities.
I came here on the weekend in July and it seemed pretty dead, not a lot of people and some stores closed.
As a foreigner as me, also pretty annoying since the restaurant owners yell at you to come to their restaurant and eat there. They also verbally fight with the neighbour restaurant to get you in the restaurant, for me really annoying and a total turn off. But i found one restaurant, located at the beginning. Its a Pad Thai restaurant and the owners are very friendly.
I think all in all the market is worth to see but be prepared that a lot of restaurant owners will loudly try to get you into their restaurant Beauty of one ratchada can be seen night than day time and also there are so many restaurants also modern shops we can buy things from there","Monday: 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM

Upon arriving he wasnt to be found. His bed was empty and so were our hopes of getting a glimpse of Ma Win. Fortunately a local man helped us find Ma Win, he was relaxing in the alley next to his spot. Overjoyed we got to pet him a bit and watch him eat some treats. Although we disturbed his relaxing time he did not seem to mind, he was humble and very gracious. Need more celebrities like Ma Win. Would recommend visiting  I was staying near Sukhumvit so one morning I went to meet Ma Win the Motorcycle Cat, but couldnt find him  Then went back in the afternoon, and asked a lady selling street food if she knew where he was And she kindly took me to him! So exciting! Its not every day that I get to meet a celebrity.  He was sleeping and not thrilled I woke him up, but that all changed when I offered him a Churu.  1010 I did not believe that this cat will be exactly same point with on the map. I went MRT station for haircut today but I walked further a bit to quick check.  Yes!!! He is there, with that legendary motorbike jacket! 100010 highly recommend

Traveled across the world to meet him and ma win did not disappoint! He had a case of the zoomies when we arrived, sprinted into the alley behind the  food stalls and promptly peed inside a dustpan, for which he was lovingly reprimanded by the store owners. He then took a bath and laid down for a midday snooze. Agree with other reviewers that this is the best attraction in Bangkok  Bangkoks best attraction and for FREE

There are lots of cafes, restaurants nearby for you to check out the life along the Chaophaya river and the pagoda from different angles. Note that if you drive, its better to park near the sidewalk or Wat Pho parking across the street. Very nice view of Wat Arun. Some tourists might be in your photos. This place is the best place to see and take photos for Wat Arun Ratchawararam.

It is total free to enter this. This place is a small water front under construction. I found this place coincidently when I passed by. You can take amazing photo that the tower insider two buildings and the best view of the night sighting. Many photographers and visitors come to here in the night.

If you want to take a photo with the Wat Arun, please spent 5 Bath to take the ferry and come to here. Just a fews minutes away from the ferry port.

There are also some cafes in buildings near the river, you can have a try when you feel exhausted. This place is on the opposite side of Wat Arun Ratchawararam. You can witness the fireworks for every new year celebration.
The night view of Wat Arun Ratchawararam is incredible with the water front. Its a great spot to be there in the evening for longtime exposures. You would need to bring a tripod and a camera within density filters. Look for place for the tripod where other people cant touch it. Take a real long exposure of several minutes to let the water be smooth and all boats are faded out. Good luck.",no operation time,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment"

Go to Tonys, food is better, can see the food being cooked, he is the OG on the canal and will serve you authentic Indian food! Nice walk along the canal, but much shorter and smaller than we expected. We went around 530pm on a Wednesday, so maybe that's why, but about half the restaurants were closed. Went in aft before street market to see art.
Some nice work and looks like more will be happening. Nice mellow walk with food and drink options and easy then to drop into Chinatown through market or down to river to get ferry.
Will visit in evening next time in Bangkok. Great area to get some quiet in the middle of the city We were there on a Sunday, and the place was still pretty busy. Everything was still decorated for the Chinese New Year, so it looked really festive. In fact, there were still Christmas decorations up from December, but it was all good. The place is beautiful, and the lighting along the canal really gives Ong Ang a pleasant atmosphere. We sampled some of the food from a couple of the stalls along the canal, and it was ok. We always found somewhere to sit, but I could tell it might be a different story if it were any busier. I loved the murals along the walk. There's always something cool to see during your walk.

The men wearing uniforms at the pier were friendly, and they tried to explain. Basically, there are two piers, one for crossing the river for locals and those visiting the palace. Another pier is for river cruise. Skip the local selling tours, go straight to the pier to buy ticket to Wat Arun.
Quite hot, no air conditioner. Chang Pier closes at 7PM. I wanted to directly cross the river to Rakhang Pier but couldn't.

this a good place to visit,
you can walk from MRT station SAMYAN station around 5 minutes. Loved this place! Beautiful location filled with greenery in the middle of the city! The venom extraction show at 11 AM was very informative for the children, and they have a good vatiety of snakes in the exhibition in the ground floor. They also have a snake show at 2 PM where you witness all snakes in live action and get to hold one too... The children especially liked snake show and the 2nd Floor exhibition where there was display of snakes and various parts of the internal organs, very educational. The cafe is clean and the drinks are decently priced!
The children got discounted tickets after showing student ID card which made the visit super economical too. A must visit!","Monday: 9:30 AM – 3:30 PM

We were lucky that the architect who refurbishment guide us around 2 hours tour. I was lucky enough to go visit there when Wang Derm Palace s open for 2 weeks for all to go visit. Unfortunately, most of the places just dont allow taking photos nor videos.

Though, you could always go and pay some respect at the King Taksin the great just right in front of the palace. It's always open! Thonburi Palace is mostly closed for public as it now serves as the headquarter of Thailand's Navy headquarters. However, during special days such as its anniversary, it would be open to public for a short period. While taking pictures is prohibited within the buildings, visitors are allowed to take pictures outside the buildings. We learn how King Taksin fight for Siamese independence from the Burnese who sacked the capital city of Ayuthya and burnt everything to the ground. Also we see how the royalty in the early years of the independence lived.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 4:00 PM

Really quiet and beautiful place with only requirement to enter  filling out a google form.
On the con side  all the information signs are in Thai and to be honest it would be nice to have information on butterflies in English. Beautiful and free to visit! None of the exhibits are in English so I went straight to the garden part. Small a 30 minute leisurely stroll through it but abundant colorful butterflies and beautiful flora. Definitely recommend if you are nearby! I had a wonderful time visiting this beautiful garden. It's filled with a variety of butterflies that add to the charm of the place. The garden is wellmaintained, and the scent of flowers is everywhere, making it a delightful experience. It's a very pleasant place to spend time in. I highly recommend everyone to visit this butterfly garden. I loved it, but you have to access it from within the park, whereas Google Maps suggests you can from road through a fence.

Takes about 30 mins maximum but it's free and you'll get some nice photos! The covered butterfly has no or very small quantity of butterflies.

Its a free entry area perfect for tourists however theres not much of butterflies on a Butterfly Garden.

The surrounding area is great, filled with trees, different kinds of plants and flowers that were well taken care of.

Lots of street vendors selling stuffjust say no and they will leave you alone. Once you make it to the end of the street, the food stands are amazing and delicious. Cheap drinks and fun music in the background. What a great way to end the night in Bangkok. Patpong Night Market in Bangkok is a lively and bustling destination for shopping and nightlife. The market offers a mix of souvenirs, clothing, and street food, making it a great place to pick up unique items. While the atmosphere can be vibrant and chaotic, it also tends to be quite touristy.

The food stalls serve a variety of local dishes, from skewers to fresh fruit, providing a taste of authentic Thai street cuisine. However, be cautious with prices, as vendors may inflate costs for tourists.

Surrounding the market, the nightlife scene features bars and entertainment options, adding to the overall energy of the area. While its an interesting place to visit, its worth exploring with a mindful approach to haggling and personal safety. Overall, Patpong Night Market offers a unique blend of shopping and culture, but be prepared for a more commercial experience compared to other local markets. A brightly set of stalls and food options. You can enjoy haggling with the merchandisers and get some decent food. Oh there is some exotic stuff like alligator meat if you dare to try! One caveat with street food is of course food safety. I did try some food and enjoyed it however I did see a few critters running around also  Hope you enjoy your experience! Bangkok's night food market is a place where you can experience the true diversity of Thai flavors and aromas. It's a melting pot of cuisines from various regions, offering a sensory journey unlike any other. For those sensitive to aromas, it can be a challenge as Bangkok has its own distinctive scent. Here, you can also discover dishes you never imagined existed and that not everyone dares to try. The market is crowded, but the items sold are too few, not enough for a foreign tourist like me to come and buy things that bear the mark of a culture with many interesting things like Thailand. The plus point is that the market is right in the center so it is very convenient to travel between the market and hotels, and most of the sellers are quite cute and hospitable.

Oh, but remember to bargain when you want to buy things here, the sellers shout prices a lot, you need to bid about 12 to 14 of the price the seller offers and you can buy them. But it's fun! It's also a signature! ","Monday: 6:00 PM – 1:00 AM

The only comment I'd like to add is the mini food court on the 3rd floor, where you can sit down, eat your purchased food and take a good view on the hustle and bustle streets through the windows. The corner has a number of eatery stalls but not all shops were rented out the day we went, so it was kind of quietgood for us tourists who wanted to relax and chilled out after hours of shopping. Kind of one of the biggest shopping Mall in BKK. All brands are here and also enjoy the foods there as well as have inside and night market infront... I didn't really spent a lot of time here but I didn't have any issues in my stay here.

It is a big mall but it is easy to navigate because it has a lot of monitorsguidemap inside the mall to help you find what you are looking for. Or you may ask the staff of the mall for assistance.

For my eyes, it looked clean and well maintained. If I have more time in the future. I will visit here again.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Rather than use the other escalators that make you go around in a maze to find them.

The silliest thing I've seen is floor 3 which is just armies of smart phone sellers. Other than that the mall is a nice mall with a nice looking slick design for the exterior. Loved the experience of MBK. A multistoreyed mall with varieties of outlet to do shopping from.
The pricing is not out of the world, and they do announce discounts on the products, so keep your eyes open for sales items.
The food outlets spoil you with choices, and you can go back again to try different places there.
The location is at a busy area of the city and can get really crowded during the peak office hours.
Parking is indoor and available easily. A good mall that has been revamped and is much better in it's current incarnation than when it was new.

The mall is connected to the Pathumwan Princess Hotel.

The mall has sufficient atms and money changers to cater to tourists.

One can find shops selling clothes, nail spas, jewelery, salons, themed restaurants,  thai restaurants, cafes eg Starbucks, fast food restaurants such as Burger King.

If youre visiting Bangkok, MBK Center is a mustsee destination for shopping enthusiasts. My tour guide recommended it for souvenir shopping, and it did not disappoint. I loved the vibrant atmosphere and the diverse shopping options.

For Introverts Expect to feel a bit overwhelmed by the bustling environment, but its worth it for the great deals and the chance to immerse yourself in local culture. Youll get to see everyday shoppers and experience the lively hustle and bustle of Bangkok.

For Extroverts Get ready to be energized! Walking among the crowds, youll feel the dynamic energy of this super mall, teeming with people from all walks of life, both locals and tourists.

Pro Tip You can barter with the merchants to get better deals. Also, keep in mind that the souvenirs on the first floor tend to be slightly more expensive than similar items sold on the upper floors.

Central Rama 9,"9/9 Rama IX Rd, Khwaeng Huai Khwang, Khet Huai Khwang, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10320, Thailand",4.5,13.7585051,100.566024,"Loved the experience of such an awesome mall. Multiple floors of restaurants, utilities, books, clothes.
You just name it, and it's there.
I utilized the money exchanger called OH Rich, and they gave a decent rate.
The shopping can be done for tourists on a moderate budget.
The escalators and stairways are added in a way to add to its inner beauty.
The only area they can improve is to add more bins. Had to keep the trash till we used the restroom where we threw it.
Parking is ample. The roads around the mall can get crowded during peak hours. I recently visited Central Rama 9 Shopping Center in Bangkok and had a delightful experience. The mall is conveniently located and easily accessible via public transportation, making it a great spot for both locals and tourists.

The variety of shops is impressive, ranging from highend brands to more affordable options, ensuring that theres something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed exploring the fashion boutiques and electronics stores, which offered a good selection of products at reasonable prices.

The dining options are another highlight of Central Rama 9. There are numerous restaurants and cafes, serving both local Thai cuisine and international dishes. I tried a few different places during my visit and was pleased with the quality and variety of the food.

One thing that stood out to me was the cleanliness and modern design of the mall. The layout is wellorganized, making it easy to navigate, and the facilities are wellmaintained. The staff throughout the mall were also friendly and helpful, adding to the positive experience.

The only reason Im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the mall can get quite crowded, especially during peak hours. This sometimes made it a bit difficult to move around and fully enjoy the shopping experience. However, this is a minor issue and didn't significantly detract from my overall enjoyment.

In summary, Central Rama 9 is a fantastic shopping center that offers a wide range of stores, excellent dining options, and a pleasant atmosphere. I highly recommend a visit if youre in Bangkok! Central Rama 9 is located around HuayKwang area. It is commutable from MRT Rama 9 Station interconnected to the mall inside.

Many varieties here, from Robinson Store to Topps Supermarket. Its b2s stationary are on the 6th floor. Many restaurants to be pick from.

SF Cinema and Harbour kids kids zone are both located on 6th Floor. This mall is connected to the MRT station. Its a huge mall with all kinds of amenities, hundreds of shops. A lot of options for electronics and beauty related shopping. Theres are a lot of good eating options available at the place but as this place is right next to the JODD fairs market, one should try the local food in the market. To get on and off the MRT line you should use the mall entry, its very convenient. Central Plaza Grand Rama 9 is one of the big shopping malls in Bangkok city.  This 12storey complex has hundreds of shops, restaurants, cafs, a cinema and an ice skating rink. The food court is a must visit when you are here, lots of delicious food and drinks are sold here.

It is directly linked to the MRT undergrounds Rama IX Station at the basement level.

It is a nice and cool place to go shopping especially on a hot day.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

In particular, I needed to exchange money and shop rich was awesome! Almost everyone in the mall spoke English so it was easy to navigate yourself. The most impressive  aspects would be restrooms. The food was truly divine and priced reasonably well. You should definitely watch the waterfall on the ceiling and take pictures from the terrace, which are all free!!! You truly feel respected, as you enter the door, there is a doorman greeting and opening the entrance for you! This mall is spectacular, the most beautiful mall I have ever seen. It's beside the river. There is a wonderful food court with more options than anyone needs. This is a place where you could wander around for hours. Many very highend stores. Many wonderful options for dining. Great plaza with a mixture of high end and cheaper street food to attract all budgets. There is a lot of food to see and eat plus higher end stores for luxury shoppers. There are also high end restaurants but I would much prefer the street food. There are many stall and shops to buy tourist goodies from too. Just be aware that if coming by car the traffic can be crazy crossing the bridge to get here. They should really improve this aspect. There is always a water light show in the evenings that is a must see. This was our first visit to ICONSIAM, and we were very impressed and surprised. It is a place where you can spend a whole day shopping and eating. The indoor floating market was a great idea, especially since it is so hot outside and often remote. It is located by one of the ferry rides. We recommend going early, having a super late breakfast, then spending most of the afternoon there, and then taking the ferry during sunset to elsewhere. The sixth floor holds different experiences depending on the season, which is fun. I wouldnt go out of my way to come here but if youre nearby there are a ton of food options and its a well done mall with a lot of interesting design elements like the indoor outdoor feel of the food court.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Weekday  quiet. Excellent for those that want to take things slower and not feel too anxious with many other shoppers around.  All shops open.. promotions ongoing..  and browsing encouraged.   Catering to perhaps a younger crowd.....  Combine with all the delights of the surrounding area and convenience of BTS Siam. as with Siam Paragon, Siam Discovery, Siam Centre shopping mall has a lot to see, shop and to eat with many restaurants, and eating establishments, and while Siam Paragon seems more focused on tourists and big budget spender, this and Siam Discovery seem more focused on more budget conscious spenders, locals, youngsters and young at hearts with more diverse price range products, although i also see lots of tourists touring around in the mall","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Best luxury mall in bangkok connected with metro railway. Hygienic toilet and clean all around. Great shopping mall, not as big as EmQuartier or Icon Siam or the other newer malls but this had enough stores and a few other eating places that would be suitable for one who did not want to be overwhelmed by the other huge malls in Bangkok.

The decor for the Asian New Year festival was done quite beautifully. Colourful graphic designs, 3d structures all lent to the festive feeling which we truly enjoyed. Another luxe shopping mall in Bangkok.
Located just couple seconds away from the Phrom Phong BTS station with direct skybridge access to Emquartier and the Emsphere.
A lot of light, a lot of nice stores and food joints.
A little bit messed up escalator locations, but thats okay, you can just use elevators.

And to be honest, halls are a little too tight for a luxe mall. I was expecting something more spacious.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Silom Complex is one the best cleanest and most modernized buildings of Bangkok. It has all the banks , restaurants and shopping facilities for everyone. Located on prime location of Bangkok and just a minute walk from the sky train too . A must visit place for tourists too. I really enjoyed visiting there . I dont know. This place feels a bit odd. By far not as fancy as all the other Centrals in Bangkok. Which is fine. But this one always feels a bit sad. And then again, they have all the stores youd expect and even some surprises.

The audience here is interesting. A very nice mix of cultures. The motorbike parking however is very improvised. But as if turns out it became permanent. It does feel a bit dodgy. Quite a number of obstacles and accident traps. Large shopping center with multiple shops, restaurants, healthy and beauty centers, hairdressers, various financial institutions and more.

The prices are reasonable and mostly depend on the brand.

Each floor is focused on a different shop kind, for example on floor 1 is the food area not only there, but on this floor there is a large amount of restaurants.

A few drawbacks are that there is no children dedicated to space or activity, no toilet on every floor, not always clear what floor has what shops type. But overall still a very nice place. Silom Complex is a really good shopping mall. It's got a great location next to BTS and MRT stations. Aside from shops, there's plenty of restaurants and cafes inside. They also have a well stocked supermarket. Probably the smallest Central department store shopping complexes but also one of the best. Recently refurbished there are plenty of dining options and boutique shops and you can walk on to the BTS with ease. The toilets are super clean, parking is good and the Tops supermarket has some of the best fresh produce of any Tops in Thailand. A nice airconditioned break if you've been walking down Silom or in Lumpini Park.","Monday: 10:30 AM – 10:00 PM

Major renovations have been carried out since my last visit and is now quite modern throughout.

Everything you could possibly want to buy from a shopping centre can be found within.

My only issues were the elevators there are definitely enough of them but due the lack of Hall Floor indicators when a lift comes everybody runs for that one elevator.

If you want drive and park I recommend getting there early like at 10.00 am because the car parking fills quickly.

In my opinion the Mall is a great shopping centre which I will be using more often. The new remodel is fantastic. Weve been coming here for years and I cant believe how much nicer it has become. There is ample motorcycle parking. The upstairs dining area is lots of fun and so many unique places to eat. My kids piano lessons here and it just the perfect place to come and spend a few hours. A long time operating shopping mall in this area.
They keep renovate many time to make their stor always new for a good shopping experience.
Parking are available on their shopping mall building. From My side the mall is nice.
It is balanced between fashion goods and food stall.
I came here to find milk bun and i found it.
I also see Cha Tra Mue Famous Thai Tea Brand stall here.
If you are muslim, there is some Halal food stand, you can see from the seller if she is wearing hijab and also the Halal Symbol.

At weekend or Holiday it tends to be a bit crowded with people. I love the cineplex cinema decor. So cool like 3D","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

A well developed mall with lots of brand and eating places. My todays highlight was eating at IKEA for the first time and trust me I had delicious food at a very good price. This is one of the biggest malls in the Bangkok area with a size more than 33000 sq m. This has every other brand showroom. IKEA, Big C Multiplex, variety of restaurants. When you plan to visit this place needs a good amount of energy to walk and roam. It has Home Pro also. Do visit and enjoy your time in shopping and food. This area of Mega Bangna reflects brilliant energy

Udon Suk Exit 5. There is a Shuttle Bus under the bridge downstairs. The drive takes about 15 minutes

The entire mall is quite large, and you can spend half a day strolling around it. There are even free electric amusement rides in the mall, but the disadvantage is that it is so big that it is difficult to find the counter or store you want to go to. Hugh shopping mall with lots of variety choices of brand. Came here to get the Gentlewomen bags.

Got lucky on the spin and get ourselves free game in top golf. A huge shopping mall. It is very clean and modern and has an amazing selection of shops as well as lots of places to eat a Cineplex and a supermarket as well. amongst others there is, Ikea, Muji, Adidas, JD, Giordano, Zara, Toms, and lots more.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

I came here only for dinner in one of the restaurant in the upper floor. Even the upper floor almost totally empty, only few shops are open The Market Bangkok is conveniently located with a skywalk connection from Gaysorn Village. Its surprising that its not more wellknown considering its prime location. Despite being a great spot, it doesnt seem to attract many visitors for dining. Additionally, there are some abandoned floors. Nevertheless, I appreciate that they maintain cleanliness very well. This food place is right in front of the mechanic stairs in the first level of the market. The food is cooked for a sweet lady who cooks the meal in the moment. Very tasty and cheap!! 100 recommended!! This May and early June has a book fair with many English books. Thiugh not many business books, non fiction books section will definitely wont disappoint you This ""Market"" is relatively small when compared with BigC next to it or even Central World right across the street. It's rather new as some of the spaces were not occupied yet. Still, if you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle found in BigC, you might want to come here and take a look. Oh, btw, the Superrich right next to it not the one inside has a better exchange rate than the ones found inside Central World.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Opens from 10am daily. One of my favorite malls I've visited in Bangkok. It's large but you don't get lost in it's size. Has everything I could need almost, and at completive prices. Understated elegance is the word that comes to mind for the vibe of the mall and the people that come here. It's classy but not too showy. Chill pace and feel to this mall. Nice local mall with a japanese food fair going on in the atrium. You can find everything you need here and prices are good.

One thing is that the flow of people doesnt stop coming in from the train station. It gets crowded during peak hours so you might want to plan your trip around that. This is one mall I will encourage all to go if not been here yet. Its a big mall thats little out from the siam, chit lom or asoke. Good shops, good food and love the crowded vibes! Theres lot of eateries here you can choose from and no lack of good food. Will be back here when back in Bangkok. Huge shopping mall directly connected to bts station. It has a nice collection of top, mid and affordable range of products.

Also lots of restaurants and fast food places in the basement floor along with Tops Food Hall super market.

While you won't find highend brand showrooms here, the mall offers a variety of fairpriced clothing and products. It features a diverse range of amenities, including a food court, restaurants, dessert shops, cafes, hair salons, bars, gift shops, a grocery store, daily product shops, aesthetic clinics, and even a 711.

You get quite a lot explained of surroundings . Places for art lovers! I was there when there's an exhibition of detective conan comic. You can find many art galleries that not only for displaying but selling as well in that mall. Also, the entrance is free. Great place for escaping the busy of the city and indulge in the beauty of any kinds of art there. The place is very beautiful with one of the best location . Ive been there before many times , this time is for rooftop movies

1. The gallery mall is super interesting , full of galleries and restaurants, even if its a bit pricey. But if staying a whole afternoon and evening, why not ?

2. besides the mall , there are many galleries nearby , the streets around 1km , can just walk around Ana explore .

3. The rooftop is comparatively not so special , but the movie I the rooftop made it special . The open space for a movie at night , with the nightview of the river and the opposite side of Iconsiam are amazing . Also the movies are romantic movies . Which is really  really really romantic , perfect idea for dates

4. There are still a lot of street food stalls outside , the food is also good , more expensive than normal street food , but good and cheap  enough compared to either the restaurants in the mall

Recommend to go and explore Went here for the ATM only, didn't know there would be art galleries here. And it was a very pleasant surprise. I enjoyed all the galleries so much. If only I have a place to put some of these arts, I would buy some. I especially liked Chubbynida's contemporary art and their take on a person's struggles to find their own identity and achieve their goals and dreams. Would love to be back here and explore the other floors. A mall for art galleries. Very unique mall for those looking for some artistics items even have a Pokmon store! It's along the Chao Praya river where you can also take a cruise ship for the sunset and buffet dinner place. Tickets are sold here. A few good restaurants selection available here as well.

You can buy frozen goods and have them it for you for a fee. No escalator or elevator going to second floor though which was a hassle. 2nd floor also was very hot during our visit. Nice place to shop many things at one place.
Also can do duty free  shopping from here. It is only one place in hamamatsu other than airport from where you can do duty free shopping. Prices are reasonable if compared to other market in Hamamatsu. You can also purchase refurbished electronic item like mobile, laptop, etc from here. I love this supermarket, you can find all kinds of Japanese food and drinks at very good prices. Besides all this, they have a huge offer of prepared dishes every day such as sushi trays, rice dishes, onigiris, skewers, mochis and much more! You can go late in the afternoon and they have many offers of ready meals, they also have tables inside the supermarket so you can eat there everything you find and you feel like eating  I've been visiting this Japanese mall for a while now, and it seems the chef never introduced any new dishes since a while now.

While the Japanese meals are good, it's a bit pricey, and it still gives off a faint plastic smell when you open the lid of the meal. The quality resembles supermarket food.

Additionally, sometimes there are a lot of people, and you have to wait a long time at the checkouts, especially during peak hours when it gets crowded.

Despite these drawbacks, I appreciate the authentic Japanese food offerings at this mall. Took the parents to visit Donki at Thonglor branch for the first time. They were very amazed of thr size of the Mall as well as the varieties of Japanese good available for purchase. Ranging from consumer products, ready to eat Japanese food, snacks, cosmetic and much more. The price is slightly higher than if you find exactly the same product in Japan. However, considering that you don't need to fly to Japan, the slightly higher price is totally acceptable. There's good parking building there so no need to worry. Visit again is a must for us.","Monday: Open 24 hours

A new mall with a lot of things to do here. Many restaurant to explore, party zone, big TV screen to cheer football, beauty zone, bank , car and plenty more stuffs which u can find all here. Must visit. I would recommend  EMSPHERE, the newly opened mall by The Mall Group, is a vibrant addition to Bangkok's shopping scene. We visited on a Sunday afternoon, and it was completely packed, especially on the two food floors. While it can be tiring and overwhelming for some, it's a fantastic spot for youngsters. A great tip is to check the queues to find the best eatsthe longer, the better! The other floors are less crowded, offering a more relaxed shopping experience. Plus, there's an IKEA store above. More for the young and trendy, super many food options and very vibrant place. Worth every of your time, ikea is here and even selling cars right on top.
Whats cooler is there are bars right on top, feels pretty hot though even on a evening! A hugegrand foodcourt with some shopping options as a topper. I spent so many hours just sipping on the delicious drinks the mall offered and always had a snack at hand. Lovely people who always welcomed you in with a smile and the food joints were fab. One thing I appreciated about all the malls I visited in Thailand is that no one bothers you even when youre a walking alone  which is a relief given how it is in India. I enjoyed being happily invisible until I asked for attention.
The upper floors of these malls have a huge array of shops and I visited Dior to try on some perfumes. The SA was so nice and welcoming, I came back the other day too.
Overall, a great day spent at the mall exploring delectable food and drinks. We visited the newly opened EmSphere in Bangkok last May 2024, and it was a great experience.

The place has a cool and trendy design, making it stand out as one of the newest spots in the city. Its definitely worth a visit, especially if youre into stylish and modern spaces.

I was particularly excited to find the Deus clothing store there, which is one of my favorites. The overall vibe of EmSphere is fresh and vibrant, making it a mustvisit destination for shopping and exploring the latest retail and lifestyle offerings in Bangkok.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Bangkok Plaza,"เลขที่ 22 Soi Phetchaburi 47, Khwaeng Bang Kapi, Khet Huai Khwang, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10310, Thailand",4.2,13.7483806,100.5838186,"Bangkok Plaza is located within the campus of Bangkok Hospital.

This is very convenient for the families of patients being treated at Bangkok Hospital, and even for the patients themselves.

It is not a very large area, but it has everything you need.

For example, there are many restaurants from different countries, such as Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Westernstyle food, fast food, Starbucks, Dunkin', and even Lebanese food.

Additionally, there is a 7Eleven convenience store open 247, a shop selling fresh fruits daily, and some simple shopping options to help you pass the time.

Although the prices are not as cheap as street food, you can be assured of the quality.

You can completely relax at this place. Its a small but packed with multiple restaurants and businesses at this sites. Many delicious restaurants from multiple cruises to choose. My personal favorite has to be the LebaneseIndian restaurant at the highest level. Due to the complex being part of the hospital, it is very clean and well maintained This is a mini mall with small restaurants, a 711, boutiques, a florist, few cafes, a bakery, and bank branches intended for hospital staff and visitors.  However, many nearby residents also sometimes come here to eat, relax, or run errands at the banks.

The building is connected to nearby the central hospital department on the 2nd floor.

The place has security, is air conditioned, and well maintained.  However, the place needs to do something about the HUGE automatic sliding doors because they let out all the cool air on the first floor. This is a great little shopping mall. There is so much  in a small space. It has a good selection of restaurants and so many shops and banks. Talk about bad service. Oh my gosh. First off I had to repeat myself twice for each thing I ordered. Second, the zombie style staff were totally not on planet earth. They didnt smile, were disrespectful and unfriendly. Third, waited over 10 minutes to get my coffee. Terrible service, terrible staff, and terrible work ethics. Manager, you should darn well learn how to do your job properly and train your staff so that they can respect customers. All the After Yous in Bangkok are pretty bad, but this one is the worst.

Paradise Park,"61 Thanon Srinagarindra, Khwaeng Nong Bon, Khet Prawet, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10250, Thailand",4.3,13.6875903,100.647631,"It is like a marketplace under the aircon, There are good cafes and restaurants on the ground floor. It connects to Paradise  Park over a walking bridge on the 2nd floor.

The Paradise Park is a like mega shopping mall which is worthy for visiting. My wife and I stayed near this mall, so we visited it very often. The basement floor has many restaurants, a fruit market, and a dessert market. However, the restaurants near the entrance tend to have some bugs cockroaches... around, so if youre uncomfortable with that, it might be better to visit the restaurants further inside look cleaner. But the food is clean since its boiled all day, and the taste is excellent. My second visit to this mall. My first was in 2017 when I visited Bangkok. Mall is well maintained after all these years. Had massage, coffee and shopping here, highly recommended! Spacious mall that is very relax to be in. A shopping mall that having a lot of rental for your business. They have some restaurants and other shops for shopping.
Parking are available on both Paradise Place and its building. As a frequent visitor to Paradise Park Shopping Center, I can attest to its vibrant atmosphere and diverse offerings. The array of shops, restaurants, and entertainment options make it a goto destination for all occasions. Whether I'm indulging in a delicious meal at one of the restaurants, browsing the latest fashion trends, or enjoying a movie night out with friends, Paradise Park never disappoints. The convenient location and ample parking add to the overall convenience of the experience. It's definitely one of my favorite places to spend time and unwind.","Monday: 10:30 AM – 9:00 PM

All the restaurants you can dream about, lot of Japanese and Thai food, dozens of computers and phone shop, a decent food court and every day events on the ground floor.

Indra Square,"อินทราสแควร์ .ราชปรารภ มักกะสัน ราชเทวี Khwaeng Thanon Phaya Thai, พญาไท Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10400, Thailand",4.3,13.7533402,100.5413372,"Must visit. Buy amazing shoes at 500 bhatt, we bought chocolates from first floor. We bought amazing neon tiger print shirt and a lot of stuff. Many Indians are there and they guide you well. Some bargaining is possible. Good quality stuff. This is one of the best places to buy souvenirs and chocolates if you are leaving Thailand after a vacation. You can find a wide variety of products here at prices that are often cheaper compared to other markets. Bargaining is an option to reduce the price of any product you purchase, but most wholesale shops do not encourage it.

It is advisable to check with multiple shops before buying a product, as different shops sell the same product at different prices. You might find that some shops on the first floor sell the same products as those on the ground floor at even cheaper prices. By comparing prices across several shops, you can ensure you get the best deal.

If you plan to buy electronic products, make sure to check whether your flight allows you to carry the battery in your checkedin luggage. If batteries are not permitted in checked luggage, you can carry them in your cabin or hand luggage. This is an important consideration to avoid any issues at the airport.

Additional information Dont plan to visit the shop in the evening, as almost every shop here closes by 8 PM. Allocate at least half a day to explore all the shops and another half day to make your purchases. Keep in mind that you wont find any original branded products here most items sold are duplicates, first copies, or unbranded. Despite this, the variety and affordability make it a worthwhile shopping experience for tourists looking to bring home gifts and mementos.

To make the most of your shopping experience, arrive early and take your time exploring. The market offers an extensive range of items, and careful browsing can lead to some great finds. Whether you are looking for traditional Thai crafts, unique souvenirs, or delicious chocolates, this market has something for everyone. This place is for shopping and they had variety of shops and this place is mainly for indians and lots of Indians works here. They have almost all the items here. Compare to other shopping malls, this place is good and affordable. I purchased luggage, shoes, accessories and clothes here for reasonable prices. You can also bargain here if youre good at it. If youre in Bangkok you should check out this place There are lot of shops to purchase. We can do bargain little bit they will reduce. Need to check and buy the quality of the item. Electronics are too cheap here compared to other places. Well when anyone wanted to visit Bangkok they should go indra market for shopping also nice quality of cloth you will find very very nice place it's Bangkok. Central near Sukhumvit MBK Plaza tower nice mean nice you explore here also it's good place by the way nice one also copy  brand you can found local food also nice. M.......

Siam Premium Outlets Bangkok,"989, Tambon Bang Sao Thong, Amphoe Bang Sao Thong, Chang Wat Samut Prakan 10570, Thailand",4.4,13.7041528,100.8379255,"During the weekend, I decided to spend some free time shopping at Siam Premium Outlet. The venue is wellorganized, featuring a wide array of international and branded products, along with numerous food outlets for shoppers to enjoy. I spent the entire afternoon browsing and ended up purchasing some clothing and skincare items. Overall, it was a great shopping experience however, I believe adding more outlets and hosting extravagant sales events throughout the year would enhance the experience even further. Additionally, the information office could better serve a diverse range of tourists beyond just those from Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, who currently receive special privileges. Anyway, the office do give away some souvenir for tourist after validated our passport on first come first served basis which served as sweetener. Been to many outlets in Thailand n this place is actually a better outlets to be...
This outlets have lots of fashion n sports brands ...even have some branded brands that I don't really see in other outlets....

Location is abit far from town but they actually have buses that comes here from Siam Paragon....just have to check the timing for their transport...

Great Place to come for some great bargains.. Siam Premium outlet is a good place for shopping . Maximum all the brand outlets are present here . They have lot of outlets having food and beverages option also . Its nearby to airport around 1015 mins .
But all the outlets doesnt have good collection or discount . Now a days we get better options and discount online also.
Best things to buy from here are shoe and cosmetics . Clothes and bags are normally priced . The ones in discount are not great . Electronics is also somewhat cheap . Nike Showroom photo and video is not allowed . It is a good choice when we have little bit shopping time to the flight on BKK airport, around 15 mins from airport.

There have many choice of famous brand store in here. Overall the product with various style and some shops have great discount such as Nike. But we need to consider there have sunshine for the outdoor area.

We have shoot the video for quick review in this outlet, check it out and support us on YouTube rcenjoylife

Thank you so much Nothing to do on a Sunday.. Woman has destination.... Siam Premium Outlets Bangkok... I grumbled a tad. I am not the best shopper but I was informed that there was a Starbucks and she wanted to buy me a wallet.
35 minute drive from center of Bangkok, well kept and they had shaded parking available on a Sunday. Layout was as other Outlet malls open and breezy.
The decor was interesting in places and it was all in all well presented, maintained and serviced. Playground for kids, coffee for adults and lots and lots of stores.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The mall itself is unimpressive but clean, featuring restaurants such as Burger King and coffee outlets like Starbucks. While it offers basic amenities, it lacks standout features. Overall, I wasn't particularly impressed with Nana Square and would rate it 3 stars for its cleanliness and convenient dining options. Opposite of Soi Nana is the Nana Square mall. It is known to have had better days. Apart from the food, which is actually pretty good and decently priced, it presently is mostly either populated by overpriced knock off shops for fashion, small service outlets like a barber and a bunch of tourist trinkets. I went to help a friend whose visa agent was located here so I had some time to stroll around. As said the food is good. There's a food court on the third floor and on the ground floor you have a new Prime burger place which I prefer 100x more over the Burger King next door. Parking is the 1st on your right entrance on Sukhumvit. Don't take the second one as that's from a bank who not surprisingly overcharges you 30thb per hour for parking. Perfectly cooked waffle, best I've had in years. Either they water down the syrup or buy the cheapest made which takes away from the complete taste. However, I'll just buy and bring my own because they are worth eating weekly. Lovely food court on the top floor  great local Thai food, real flavours, clean, friendly staff. Recommended! The mall for the rest is sadly quite empty. Nana square ..!! A deserted mall in bangkok city with few shops inside

Starbucks and few other dress shops are there ..!!

 Tips for Visiting

 Explore Beyond Shopping Take time to enjoy the art and cultural events, which can be a unique experience.
 Weekday Visits Like other popular spots, it can get crowded on weekends, so consider visiting during the week for a more leisurely experience.

..Chat.G.P.T.. Wow, this old mall surrounding Chatuchak Weekend Market blew my mind! Cheap Thai products, cheap massage, cheap clothes, anime lovers hall, vintage cameras, vintage pokemon card, used nintendo, ds, used handbags from Japan, used luxurious goods, fake flowers and plants, art stuff, scarf, bags, hats, Thai food court, and more! I bought a lot of stuff here before leaving Bangkok. 

Auntie Anne, Dairy Queen, and cafes are available here, too.

I came here on Wednesday when it wasn't crowded as Chatuchak Market was closed, and only plants were sold. 

If you are an anime figurine collector, you should come to Mixt!  There's also an art store at the food court where you get to buy a celebritycharacter frame. 3 for 900. It has 3 floors which so many shop at the first floor and less on second and third floor.
Quite a large scale of pop up toy range till you cant make decision to choose what you like the most.
Massage service are also a lot.

They have a food court on the third floor.

Rental spaces are available for starting your business.

Parking are available on their building.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Bangkok Fashion Outlet,"919, 1 Si Lom Rd, Khwaeng Silom, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand",3.7,13.7218249,100.5202222,"Bangkok Fashion Outlet no more. Don't come here hoping to find fashionable clothes or shoes !! All my favorite shopping clothes spots in Bangkok are disappearing... why oh why  ???. Bangkok Fashion Outlet my mustgo store for buying nice and discounted clothes from asian brands like Bess, Journal, Nextphase, Easypieces, Britishindia, pieces usually coming from released stock of the Central Stores, unfortunately no longer exist.  Also gone the sports shoes shop outlets. The space it's now occupied  by small one man stands selling gems, practically the only thing you can buy nowadays in the building. When I was there two days ago, it looked like the only people milling around  apart from the indian vendors were office workers coming to eat in the food court on the ground floor... I give it a few months for the building to be remodeled for other uses. So dead. Nothing to see or buy. Only go there if you need jeweleries god knows if they're real or not. Quite gloomy and shady atmosphere. Bangkok Fashion Outlet is a decent shopping destination if you're looking for branded items at discounted prices, but it does come with its limitations. While the outlet offers some good deals, the selection is somewhat limited, both in terms of stock and variety of brands.

One of the main draws of Bangkok Fashion Outlet is the promise of bargains on wellknown brands. There are indeed opportunities to find discounted items from reputable labels, making it a worthwhile visit for those seeking to save money on fashion purchases. However, the range of brands available is not as extensive as one might hope. Shoppers might find themselves with fewer choices compared to other larger outlets or malls in Bangkok.

The stock levels can also be a hit or miss. Often, certain sizes or styles may be unavailable, which can be disappointing if you're looking for something specific. The inventory seems to rotate frequently, so it might be necessary to visit multiple times to catch the best deals or find what you're looking for.

On the plus side, the shopping environment is clean and wellorganized, making it easy to browse through the available merchandise. The staff are generally helpful and ready to assist with any queries, adding a positive touch to the overall shopping experience.

In summary, Bangkok Fashion Outlet is a reasonable option if you're hunting for discounted branded items, but manage your expectations regarding the variety and availability of stock. It's worth a visit if you're in the area, but might not be the best choice if you're looking for a wide selection of brands and a consistently plentiful inventory. A lot less clothing outlets and more gems shops now in 2024. Still good for cheap sports shoes, and the factory outlet of cheap casual clothes .
The sports outlet is still going well, but the jewelry and gem outlets are now spreading into the 3rd floor zone where clothing used to be sold. Very bad experience, it is a disgrace that they even call this a Fashion Outlet most shops are empty, only a few stores actually sell fashion, but not much choice and no good prices. I did not buy anything here, waste of time. Took a cab to Platinum Fashion Mall close to Central World. You better go there for fashion.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Im not saying you can fly your drone there, Im just saying its empty. There aren't many shops here at all. I came here in 2019 when it was known as 'Show DC', and I understand there are less shops now than there was in 2019. It has a Starbucks, McDonald's and a food court and is emerging as a music concert venue.  This is a Deserted Mall you don't find anyone, no people, and no shops are open.

 This place doesn't give the vibe of a mall it's just an empty space to relax I guess.

 All the shops were closed nothing to see, nothing to do Completely Boring I would come again and would recommend the others to come.
1. Feeling so comfortable here because there is not much people here.
2.The tourist lounge is awesome. Good to rest before taking a plane at night. The phone can be charged for free here.
3. Some items here are having up to 70 discount which is very worthy to buy.
4. The XL locker here is charged for 60Baht for 2 hours, oversize is 70Baht2hr. The price is reasonable to me. Due to not much people in the lounge, luggage can also be put beside me in the lounge.
5. The fried chicken of McDonald here is tasty and juicy. Love the new cafe, Sahara opposite Show DC Mall  also the biggest gym at 3600sqm  in Bangkok. Fit Whey Gym opens from 10am till Midnight and have expansive classes, weights, treadmill. Love it!

I believe they operate together to give you a very low price for your gems and rip you off.
For an example, i tried to sell a Royal blue sapphire from Sri Lanka 1.3ct and most of them told me that they have plenty of ceylon blue sapphires above 1ct and therefore maximum they will do is 350 USD per ct for the particular stone. Most of the stores, specifically the indian ones quoted similar prices.
I was surprised when my friend checked their selling price for a similar stone which was above 1000 USD!
I went to an office outside JTC and sold the same stone for 700 USD per ct.its unbelievable how these JTC people try to almost steal your merchandise.

In essense, dont sell here and dont buy from here. Its not like other shopping centres but this place good for you looking for beautiful stones and Gems. The restaurant is ok . Good place to buy Sapphire,Ruby, Emerald,Jade,Amber ,plenty of semi precious stones and also Rough stones..Gems lab Like AIGS,ICA,AIG and More..

The smallest very favorite shopping mall ammo the tourists.

There are a variety of things you can buy and price wise I think it is reasonable.

Unfortunately after covid, I am visiting Bangkok, and I found this mall, lost it's glory. I fell like, there are not much things available in the mall anymore. Maybe it's a covid effect. Eventually they'll be okay I guess.

When I was in the mall today, I didn't find many people. The mall was almost empty. There are few people shopping but before it was a  busy shopping mall.

If you buy at least 2000 baths  product, you can get it fat refund from the airport. But you need to endorse your cash memos before you leave the mall.

There are three levels. If you come by BTS, you can get down at ashok station. You can park your car there are a lot of parkings available.  Also at the underground, you'll find it super shop.

You could pretty much find most of the things you are looking for, clothes, shoes, foods, cinema. This is very good place for shopping and dining. I have seen the clothing are selling in more discounted rates at the moment and best time for shopping here.ATM, Restroom , all kinds of restaurant and movie theater and play station, kids areas available. Multiple parking facility available. A decent place for shopping and dining, if you are staying near the airport During a recent visit to Lat Krabang in Bangkok, my family and I stumbled upon Robinson Lifestyle Mall, a hidden gem that wasn't there on our previous visit. A few years ago, the area was merely fields, but now it's transformed, boasting this charming shopping center.

Robinson Lifestyle isn't overwhelmingly large but offers a comfortable size spread over two floors. The range of merchandise is impressive for its scale, with a focus on midrange brands that strike a balance between affordability and quality. While you won't find highend luxury brands, there are several aspirational labels and lesserknown brands that offer unique finds.

One of the highlights was the surprisingly low prices. Despite initially planning just to browse, we ended up spending over 4000 Thai baht on a backpack and some small appliancesitems that are hard to come by in the UK. The backpack, which I had been eyeing for a while, was offered at such a tempting price that it was impossible to resist.

Adding to the excitement of our visit, a Thai celebrity was at the mall that day. While I wasn't familiar with them, my wife was thrilled, briefly turning into a starstruck fan. It was a delightful moment for her, and seeing her so happy made the experience even more special.

The mall itself was clean, welcoming, and wellmaintained. The staff were friendly and helpful, contributing to a pleasant shopping experience.

In conclusion, Robinson Lifestyle Mall in Lat Krabang is a delightful discovery for those looking for quality shopping at reasonable prices. It's a testament to how much the area has developed, offering a comfortable and enjoyable shopping experience without the overwhelming hustle of larger malls. Whether you're a local or just passing through, it's definitely worth a visit. One of a nice lifestyle shopping mall from Central group. Quite convenice for people around this area.

As one of Bangkok's OG department stores, it now boasts a compact and easytonavigate layout. The new design is fantastic, offering a quiet and pleasant shopping experience. There are numerous offers on products ranging from cosmetics and luxury brands to kids' appliances and kitchenware. Even if you're not shopping, it's worth a visit just to admire the place itself! Wow the Chidlom location has gone through a massive renovation and it has a lot more luxury brands than before. VM has definitely improved and there are more new brands that I have not seen elsewhere in Asia like Sporty  Rich. Worth a visit and it connects to Central Embassy and there are tons of food options on the way there. The department store has a refreshing facelift since my last visit in Sep 2023 Glad to see its more arty, lively and young.. Central Chidlom is one of the Original Central stores in Thailand.
The department store just been renovated as of Q2 2024.

With still keeping its heritage floorplan, the newly renovates space becomes more modern and vibrant for each floor.

The fasion zone for both men and ladies are slight more premium and more focused on imported fabrics luxury zone.

Muji is still located on the higher floor floor 6th.

The basement level are tops supermarket zone as well as the foodcourt or known as FoodHall. This is a large department store under the central group which I think is probably the largest department store  mall chain in Bangkok. They offer fashionable clothes here as well as shoes, accessories, personal hygiene, cosmetics, skin care and so much more. This place is connected to Central embassy","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Parking fee 20 baht hour,  can't beat that. You will never find parking on the side of the street this part of town. Very cost effective and pocket friendly place.

I can't imagine the director of this sorry excuse for a zoo would want to spend 30 years behind bars with nothing to entertain him but a tire swing and some ropes! I really recommend this place
It is another memorable place of mine
I grew up with it and it never gets old for me

2 years ago i visited here and it brought back all old memories

When i was young my mom took me here to the zoo and i had such a great experience

I also had gone to IT city here to buy a bunch of PC games and i had a blast playing all of it

Right now it is being renovated, i can't wait to be here again Animal abuse!!! How can someone built zoo in department store is out of my mind. Let animals live in decent conditions in sanctuaries and tear this old terrible building down This place very old, wasteful not have guests i think it not call department store but just first floor only , on roof top have zoo but in cage it so dirty. Its sad to see that the animals are still in this poor and caged environment, i went to pata zoo as a child over a decade ago and hoping this would improve but it has gotten worse.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

The variety of shops and food choices make it a mustvisit. Great spot for a shopping spree and tasty eats!  We live quite close to the Mall and we go there frequently. The Mall is not the biggest in town but offers the variety of shops you need for your weekly needs at home. There also some nice restaurants to try. Compact. Very compact actually...and I got the sensation this perhaps one of the older shops around Bangkok. Nothing wrong.. just not as spacious as what I have come to know and expect from sister stores in more illustrious malls... perhaps everyone is gearing for Christmas..  hence the bursting at the seams feeling...

The place you can find good food at an open air cooked food market. It has tops supermarket where you can get your daily necessarry groceries. When it comes to restaurant , it has few of them includes Pizza, steaks, KFC , MAC D,  Ramen, Sushi , Hot Pot, Grill ,Ice creams, few bakeries and Tea shops. Common brands are available for shopping such as HM , Lee, Levis, Giordano, MC , HARA, and sports brand.

On my return chanced upon this place ap j went in for a look, also looked for something to eat and shop. It's not huge but it's adequate,  very much favored by the locals in the area. There's some sort of night market right outside the building.  It's a very short walk from the sky train station.

Ate it with rice, some clear Tom yum soup and Phad Thai and finished with a mango sticky rice.

Oddly the mango sticky rice was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The mango wasnt particularly sweet but the sticky rice was good. Also my mango shake wasnt all that great.

Overall the steamed seafood curry was so phenomenal that despise those flavors its still a 5 food rating.

PS loved the deco and environment inside. The name of restaurant really suits the place as it does make you sit and wonder when look around. The staff were friendly, and the ambience is really good too. Not too loud and not too noisy. The food was incredible as well. The Mango Sticky Rice is amazing! I love this local Thai restaurant! The decor was such a vibe, with old film cameras and artsy things on the shelves. The chicken pad thai was only 75 baht and was very tasty! The watermelon shake cost 70 baht and that was also delicious! Yummy food, amazing prices, lovely service, and a very welcoming atmosphere. 1010 I stopped in here for a quick, light meal. I decided on Thai iced coffee, some wings and the papaya salad. All three were great! The papaya salad was awesome and as the coffee. The wings were maybe a bit over cooked but nonetheless, had excellent flavour! 2 minute walk from Marriott Hotel. Cute little place. Air conditioned. Thai food.

I had the pad Thai which was OK. Only 75 baht. Much cheaper than the hotel.

The sweet lemon tea was way too sweet. The iced long black was perfect. Happy with the flavour and strength.

I was able to sit here for a few hours working. I enjoyed the energy of the place. A nice amount of people, music was comfortable volume, and people not speaking too loud. Many people seemed to be here for some work discussions.

The staff don't speak much English but are still friendly. The menu has English and Thai writing.

Note if your bill is less than 300 baht you need cash, not card. My two drinks and meal was less than 200 baht, thankfully I had cash.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:30 PM

But the quantity was kinda less than my expectations. Expensive considering the quantity offered. The kiwi smoothie on the other hand was absolutely delicious and worth every baht! The service was good. The staff is friendly and professional.  The ambience is excellent.  Their cutlery is very cool. Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at FOOD UNIVERSE Thai International Cuisine, located in Century The Movie Plaza Sukhumvit, right by BTS On Nut station in Bangkok. This restaurant turned out to be a hidden gem, offering a wide array of Thai and international dishes that delighted my palate.

As soon as I stepped into FOOD UNIVERSE, I was welcomed by a modern and vibrant atmosphere. The restaurant is spacious, clean, and welllit, making it a pleasant spot to enjoy a meal. The menu is extensive, featuring a variety of Thai favorites as well as some creative fusion dishes. I was particularly impressed with the attention to detail in both presentation and flavor.

One of the standout dishes I tried was the traditional Thai red curry. The curry was rich and creamy, with just the right amount of spice, making it a perfect comfort food. Another highlight was the vegan stirfry rice noodles, which, despite an initial hiccup with the ingredients, was delicious and wellseasoned. The restaurant also offers a dedicated section for vegan and vegetarian options, which is a thoughtful touch for those with dietary preferences.

The service at FOOD UNIVERSE was impeccable. The staff were friendly, efficient, and more than willing to accommodate special requests. They provided excellent recommendations and were very attentive, ensuring that my dining experience was smooth and enjoyable.

I also appreciated the affordability of the meals. Despite being situated in a prime location, the prices were reasonable, making it a great option for both locals and tourists. The ambiance of the place, combined with the quality of the food, made every baht spent worth it.

In terms of feedback from other diners, FOOD UNIVERSE has garnered positive reviews for its diverse menu and quality service. Many visitors have praised the restaurant for its delicious food and welcoming atmosphere. There were a few mentions of occasional inconsistencies with some dishes, but overall, the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the restaurant's ability to cater to a variety of tastes and dietary needs.

Overall, my experience at FOOD UNIVERSE Thai International Cuisine was exceptional. The combination of great food, excellent service, and a comfortable dining environment makes it a mustvisit spot in Bangkok. If you find yourself near BTS On Nut, I highly recommend stopping by FOOD UNIVERSE for a memorable dining experience. You won't be disappointed. Speechless!!!!!!
It's not cheap and it got great points on Googlemaps so we have expectations.
However, the spaghetti is too salty and the shrimp in it is not fully cooked. It's a little raw. And the fried pork chop is not good either. The noodle soup is almost uneatable. The only notbad item is chips. I saw 4.8 points and went here. DON'T KNOW WHY it is like this!!!!!!! Had lunch here seeing the awesome reviews and also since the place is right next to metro station. Service is nice, however, the food taste in general could have been better. Great atmosphere.  Great food. If you are in the area stop by for a meal.","Monday: 12:00 – 10:00 PM

Service is what I would call ""relaxed"" which is my polite way of saying that they are perfectly balanced between not giving a toss and being bloody lovely.

As all other reviews say, it works for tourists and locals alike and I tend to agree. I saw a complaint about the smells and smoke from the kitchen getting in diners faces but for me this is a plus without question. I want my nostrils to flare with the choices of my fellow diners to sacrifice tomorrow's rear end. Plus that old abandoned floating barge is Wak. Tops. Nice food for a good price. We ate there few times for dinner when we stayed in Bangkok. We never waited for food more than 15mins. Very nice Tom Yum soup! Admittedly, didnt go for the full divein on this one after recovering from some food poisoning on our trip but took some bits here and there of my friends dishes. Love the location. Favourite place to eat before 56 in Bangkok. Have come here almost every day for the past two weeks  and several times on previous journeys. Every dish I've tried here is delicious and fresh.

We finally were nearby enough to visit. It did not disappoint. We had only one issue that I had ordered boiled dumplings and received fried but they were still good. Thick dumpling skins. Not recommended to go at 3pm because the resto closed from 3305pm. I went at 305pm and rushed myself badly. The waitress get off from worked punctually. I had my leftover food packed and left at 335pm. Am not sure because I walked in late or not but the cashier seems cold.

Shrimp fried rice has nice aroma from the wok but tasteless and the shrimp is the cheap frozen type. I asked waitress if the combo comes with janjanmian. I misunderstood that it would come with noodle but its not. Another dish is lemon creme shrimp sauce. They use a better quality of shrimp and bigger size. Taste sweet but delish. Better eat fresh cook coz they r batter deep fried. It becomes socky if u pack home. Overall i prefer other dishes i tried before. There definitely seems to be a hygiene issue. I didnt have to go to the hospital like some of the other reviewers, but I had severe diarrhea all night... The food was tasty, but I suffered all night. Im never going back. The restaurant is run by a Korean. Design is simple and clean. Not many tables but it is full when we went for a Sunday lunch. Water and appetizers are at free flow as the same as other authentic Korean restaurants. The price listed on the menu is net price without surcharge.

The dishes are hot and delicious. The portion is very big. The ice cream cooler outside the restaurant is also interesting.

The Thai staff provided not so good services.  However the Korean is very nice. It's just like a Korean style chinese food.
You don't need to pay for the water...
It's better than Korean Chinese restaurant..
I actually don't eat the jjambbong soup whereever I go....
But it's my first time to finish up the soup twice...
It's really delicous...

At our table we had shrimp pad Thai, chicken pad Thai, and another shrimp dish. No one was disappointed. One may argue theres smaller, less touristy pad Thai joints, that edge this place out but come here for the iconic experience and wont walk with a disappointed pallet.  We visited this restaurant because it's often hailed as one of the most recommended spots in Bangkok for Pad Thai, with the added prestige of being recognized by Michelin for its street food. The variety of Pad Thai options on the menu was impressive, and the flavors were generally good. However, I found the dish to be a bit too sweet for my taste.

After trying other lesserknown spots around the city, I have to say that this place feels a bit overpriced for what it offers in terms of flavor. While the food is decent, it's not the best Pad Thai Ive had in Bangkok. That said, the service here is topnotchthe staff are friendly and attentive, which made the experience more enjoyable.

The restaurant itself is clean, wellmaintained, and provides a comfortable atmosphere, making it a great place to relax for an extended period. However, both tourists and locals may find it quite expensive, especially given the range of affordable and equally tasty options elsewhere in the city. Overall, its a good place to try, but if you're looking for the best value for money, you might want to explore other options. One of the most famous Thai street food restaurant in Bangkok. The queue was crazy when we were there but we were persistent as well. Waited for a few hours just to have a taste of it but there wasnt any regrets. The pad Thai was really the best I ever had. I wasnt really a pad Thai fan to begin with. I felt that the dish was very heavy on carbohydrates and eating too much made me feel bloated. But the pad Thai here wasnt like that. It wasnt as heavy as I would expected. Savory and sweet at the same time. The prawns were huge and fresh. The prices were high based on local standard but I still thought its worth it. At least try it for once but I probably wouldnt want to queue for hours again. Since 1939, Thipsamai Pad Thai has redefined the standard of Thai street food, serving one of Thailands most famous dishesPad Thai. The original restaurant offers a clean, fully airconditioned environment, making it a comfortable dining experience. The customer service was exceptional, and the food was superb. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish.

We even decided to order takeout and bought some meal prep kits to try at home. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is a musttry!

We highly recommend this restaurantcome and experience it for yourself!

The menu offered a great variety of Pad Thai options, and while the flavors were decent, I found it a bit too sweet for my liking.

good food with reasonable price.
the queu is long but does not take lot of waiting time to get in.
the atmosphere is local vibe, not luxury but clean and well organized.
the taste is quite strong kinda salty to someone but will be balance when eating with rice or rice noodles.
highly recommend green curry dish.
1 thing we did not satisfy was the dish we ordered was out of stock but they only let us know after waiting for almost 20 mins.
last order at 8.15pm and the restaurant closes at 8.30pm. A highly acclaimed and widely recognized restaurant that draws a diverse clientele. While the staff was satisfactory, there was a 30minute wait time. However, we took advantage of this by enjoying a leisurely stroll in the vicinity.

The culinary offerings were prepared promptly and proved to be both delectable and satisfying. There were no dishes that failed to meet our expectations.

Particularly noteworthy were the grandma fried rice and the papaya salad, which we had the pleasure of trying for the first time here and found to be exceptionally wellexecuted.
Prices are reasonable too and cheapish. One of my favorite restaurants in Bangkok during our trip, we went here almost everyday. The line could get pretty long, but it goes by pretty fast. They make one of the best fried rice ive tasted in Bangkok, affordable price too! The food has a high costperformance ratio and tastes great. The service is fast, and there are plenty of seats. Located in the bustling Siam Square, it's very convenient and a great spot for group gatherings! I. Basil Pork  Just average, it is fragrant but the pork is overcooked, and tastes a little powdery
Ii. Phad Thai  Lacking in terms of flavor, just feels quite bland  just slightly sweet, and does not have the fragrance that comes with high heat cooking
Iii. Oyster omelette  crispy omelette which was nice, but oysters are very small and no umami
Iv. Chicken wings  Nice crispy fry on the skin, but as the restaurant wanted to create the illusion of having more by cutting the mid wings into 2, it caused the wing to dry up
V. Tom Yum Goong  The only highlight I had over here, super umami, and not a single component that dominates the whole dish, it is the right amount of spice, acidity, even slight sweetness and light enough to make me want to finish the whole bowl by myself
VI. Larb pork salad  Refreshing side, taste was bright and acidic, making it appetising for other dishes but the meat can be a bit overcookedpowdery

The queue moves relatively fast, but I would say not necessary to visit specially for this unless youre in the area

Food is served relatively slow as well","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:15 PM

Delicious.

They ave vegetarian options for those inclined to eat that way. Delicious local Thai food.
Price friendly and the place is very clean.

Sookdal Premium Korean BBQ,"92/1-3 94 Rama I Rd, Khwaeng Wang Mai, Pathum Wan, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10330, Thailand",4.8,13.7472069,100.5240678,"The Korean barbecue experience was excellent, especially the premium option. The side dishes were plentiful and delicious, so it's advisable not to overorder main dishes. The beef and pork were satisfactory, with a preference for the pork over the beef. Although we opted for the premium beef, it was quite fatty and did not compare to Japanese A5 beef. The pork, however, was exceptional, with each piece labeled according to its aging period. The service was commendable as it ensured we did not get our hands dirty while grilling, allowing us to focus solely on enjoying the meal. Overall, a truly absolutely amazing experience. The grilled meats, side dishes and cold noodles were all very flavourful and tasty.

Service was impeccable, meat grilling was done by their welltrained staff, and side dishes refilled without you even requesting. You only ever needed to lift your hands to feed yourself.

The entire experience was so good that my family and I dropped by twice during our 1 week trip. If you want the best KBBQ experience that Bangkok has to offer, this is the place to go to. A very satisfying Korean BBQ meal! We ordered a beef set 2250 that came with three different types of aged beef, a Korean shabushabu, and various side dishes, including grilled cheese, pineapple, and mushrooms. The beef was tender and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the grilled cheese beef rolls, where melted cheese wrapped around the juicy beef. Just eating the grilled beef alone was filling enough, but we also had the hot pot, mushrooms, and other side dishes...and also watermelon after the meal. It was truly abundant!

The restaurant is only a few minutes walk from the National Stadium station. The atmosphere is great, and the dining space is spacous even you have only two people. You don't have to do the grilling yourself as experienced staff will take care for you. BBQ lovers shouldn't miss it! Phenomenal Korean BBQ experience in Bangkok, only good things to say! Ordered the Beef Set to share between two and it was perfectlyportioned and wellpriced 2,350. The selection of meat was incredible, but me and my boyfriend agreed that the ribeye and short rib were better than the brisket. The banchan was very delicious, we especially loved the japchae and kimchi. The cheesewrapped beef in the end is also a delight, but a very rich mouthful! We ordered tteokbokki and it was also very tasty, with a nice seafood taste. The whole process is so smooth the meat is cooked to your liking by the staff, and the banchan refilled without asking. The staff are very friendly and attentive they ask you how rare you want your meat to be cooked, change the grill according to the meat being cooked, and frequently adjust the exhaust fan so there is no oil spatter they provide aprons and plastic bags for your bags, so if there is any there is not a worry. They dont take reservations and Id imagine it gets pretty busy on the weekends, but we went on a Monday around 6 and didnt have any issues. Better than any Korean BBQ Ive had in London, Singapore, and Toronto, so if youre in Bangkok and want Korean BBQ this is a must! A wonderful well service 2 floors restaurant. The meats are bbq by the staff. As we are eating slowly, the waitress is kind enough to ask if she should stop the bbq and come back later after we finished the meats on the plates.
They are also attentive to you and ask if refill is require when you have finished the side dishes and the sauces.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

One order is enough for two people to enjoy.
The restaurant has recently been renovated in a retrochic style.

I went out for lunch with my family. Normally, I would order Hainanese chicken rice, but this time, I decided to try something different. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my choice because the seafood wasn't freshit was clearly frozen. Considering the price and the fact that this is a hotel restaurant, more attention should have been given to the quality of the ingredients.

For the service, I would rate it 3 out of 5. Compared to the service before the renovation, it was much better back then. The staff used to be very attentive, but now it's not the same, which leaves me feeling disappointed.

I hope that in the future, the restaurant will improve the quality and freshness of the ingredients, as well as the service. If these improvements are made, I will definitely return to dine here again. Chicken rice Chicken rice Chicken rice!
Must try and portion is for 2!! Love the rice, the chicken and the sources.

If you are around the area, would highly recommend the place. It will be pack during lunch hours, arrive before 1100 or after 1330 would be perfect time for lunch. Another great chicken rice!

My my fav menu is absolutely the chicken rice. The bean also surprisingly good. Their yentafo was quite sweet not my preference.

The chicken rice come with huge portion. Which i can share with my mother and both still getting full. Really enjoy every component of it. Good as always.

Ps.their chrysanthemum tea was super aromatic. Nothing much to say it is the legendary place for chicken on rice in Thailand always in TOP 5 best list so you wouldn't go wrong much here but surprisingly the other dish was nice too so i would recommend to try it out Absolutely delicious chicken rice, Chinese food and Thai dessert! I love Chicken rice because the chicken was tender, and the rice perfectly cooked. Great value for money. The staff were friendly, and the ambiance was welcoming like home. The chicken rice exceeded my expectations  flavorful and cooked to perfection. Will definitely be returning.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM

Got some local favourites and some unique takes on regional specialities. The crispy noodles were amazing, the seafood tom yum soup is the perfect mix of sour, spicy and umami, the fried kale with crispy pork was well infused with ""wok hei"".  The salted egg squid deserves special mention  instead of the crumbly or creamy versions often encountered elsewhere, this version has the salted egg prepared into a smooth, tart and savoury sauce that is very appetising and not overly rich. Definitely will definitely come back! This is a very old ThaiChinese restaurant that serves homestyled dishes.

Mr Saksun, the current proprietor's grandfather started the business about 100 years ago after arriving in Thailand from Hainan by boat.

It is open everyday but only during lunch and dinner hours only, not the whole day. There are two sitting areas, the front section is non air conditioned and back section is air conditioned. Prices of food are the same, irrespective of where we sit.

The taste of the food is authentically delicious and reminds us of homecooked food. Service is fast. Prices are very reasonable too.

A very recommendable place. One of the masks around this area food prices is reasonable you cannot miss the crispy noodles. The recipe is over that 80 years ago since King Rama V. The parboil cockles is so good. And the Tom Yum is pretty nice. Aircon room available, if you want. Small family run Thai place. Its run in third generation since 1966. They still have the original first menu on the wall.

Very nice Tom Yum. Well balanced with a touch of sourness.also the deep fried beef and razor clams are excellent.

The place has a beautiful old style front room with fan and a back room with AC. Service is very good as well. If youre looking for an authentic dining experience in Bangkok with absolutely delicious homecooked dishes, you have to stop by Mit Ko Yuan. They serve the kind of ChineseThai cuisine that locals with Chinese ancestry would eat on a daily basis. Most of the dishes have been on the menu for years and the recipes have stayed the same. Their dishes are simple and absolutely delicious. Super affordable. Very causal. A great option for casual lunch or dinner in the old town area. My favorite dishes are their stirfried morning glory and Tom Yum Kung. Im Thai and I can tell you that the way they do it here is the way we cook at home!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 1:30 PM, 4:00 – 9:30 PM

I loved the southern fish curry.  It was very spicy but was also very flavorful.  I was warned not to order it but Im happy I did.  The only disappointment was the mango and sticky rice.  The mango was soft but had no flavor.  Ive had much better mango on the breakfast buffet at the Mandarin Oriental. The name probably says it, a very local taste with quality ingredients and some rare ingredients from different regions of Thailand. Solid, not fancy, though quite pricey matching up to their Michelin Bib Gourmand. The highlight dish for me was the Massamun beef cheeks which melts in your mouth. The mixed appetizer was a nice little opening adventure. Great atmosphere, a good place to bring foreign guests. I visit The Local every time I come to Bangkok.  It has always been outstanding.  Except this time.  Everything I had tonight from the lemon grass salad to the curry, to the tea and desert, was overly sweet and unidimensional.  It wasnt that anything was bad.  The place is still very nice and the service highly attentive.  But rather, much better flavour can be found on more humble, often small and plastic, tables just outside. This is my second time.

Food superb. 1010 Ask for less spicy if you cant take spicy food.

Service very good. Foods and drink served very fast.

Atmosphere traditional Thai style design with antique decorations. Indoor with air conditioned and outdoor with fan.

Highly recommended. Please make reservation before you come. This place is really pretty and the environment is wonderful. Only issue I had was the service staff, although they are busy, its not right to totally ignore customer and constantly showing an unhappy attitude.

The menu is quite extensive with a wide selection of Western and Thai food. We ordered a simple and delicious lunch of Pad Thai 210b, Oyster Omelette 180b and Stir Fry Morning Glory 150. The serving size is quite generous.

Service is friendly.

Note because our meal is less than 1000b in total, an additional charge of 3 is added for payment with credit card, on top of the 7 VAT. The restaurant is good for young generation and salary man.

Food Good for all ingredients and simple menus with delicious  tast. The squids  were excellent including local salad.

Service Good in attention and come to ask satisfaction time by time.

Location Not really roof top restaurant just 4th floor of business building. We need to walk up until the last step. Quite difficult for senior citizens or who has problems with knees.

We will think again if decision to go there. 1st time to be here which followed the review from others. The location is good you can take the train to Taksin then walk only 2 minutes. But parking is limited you need to park somewhere nearby with paid service. The rooftop is nice can see the city view and enjoy the windy if lucky. Or else, you can sit indoor from 1st floor to 5st floor, if you prefer the live band the 5st floor will be good choice. Foods are good you can pick the recommended dishes from the menu list with reasonable price. The drink is and option for beers or you can go with liquor but no wine list. This is my first stop in Bangkok. Was hungry after getting to the hotel, saw it was close and had a good rating. Amazing. The pork belly was sweet and crunchy. I had the spicy raw salmon dish and wow. Not just a spicy dish, so many flavors like I was hoping, like a spicy ceviche. Last thing I had was the beef curry.  Delicious. I didnt get it as the waiter said Thai spicy, but I should have. Very delicious! Sat on the rooftop bar and the atmosphere was lovely for dinner.We tried out the chinese cabbage, amongst many other things such as the crispy pork belly and pork shoulder which both melted in our mouths, after not having it before, it won over the whole family, so definitely worth trying if you come! Zaw was a lovely waiter and so were all the other staff! Recommend massively ","Monday: 11:00 AM – 2:00 AM

It certainly did not disappoint. Portions are generous and the taste was amazing.

The  was just ok but the seafood jjajangmyun and jjampong were  I visited Aisung in Pattaya and I was so satisfied that I visited Aisung in Bangkok this time.
It was really nice to hear "".   ."" I don't know about Bangkok, but in Chiang Mai Korean restaurant, most Korean owners leave their seats.
That's why most people order from Thai staff when they go to Korean restaurants.
As expected, the food was really good as well as welcome Korean.
A couple of 7 and 8yearold kids visited together and ordered 2 ganjjajang, sweet and sour pork medium size, 2 plates of fried dumplings, and yangjangpi.
It was so good to order how good the yangjangpi was.
Every food I ordered was so delicious.
I ordered a lot of food and ate it at home because I packed lots of leftover food, but it was also so delicious.
The staff were also so kind and especially a young Korean female employee I don't know if she is the boss was so kind.
And my daughter said she is so pretty.  Everything was the perfect meal.
Thank you. We are visiting Bangkok for the first time and craved some jjajangmyun and jjompong noodles and of course tangseuyuk sweet and sour pork. All the dishes were excellent and simply better than the same dishes in the greater Seattle area. The next time we visit Bangkok, we are seriously considering getting a room in this neighborhood for easy access to Isung  Taste is really good and size is no joke. If you come alone you can order small size. Vibe and services are friendly. And they play all Kpop music  Found the restaurant on google and decided to try out the food and it was great experience!!
Chef is Korean, all dishes has small size if you come alone or big portion for group sharing. Strong recommend the Tangsuyuk ","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:30 PM

Very tasty food available for dine in or takeout. Seafood was tasty but a little overcooked. Very tasty Tom Yum soup and fried rice. The dragon fruit frappe was delicious too!

Friendly, fast and efficient service. Available also in Thai and English.

Payments accepted with cash or card.

Reservations not needed even on weekdays during busy season.

Handicap friendly and wheelchair accessible. Seating area a bit tricky and smelly

Parking is safe and easy nearby.

Printed menu.

Vegetarian options available.

Outdoor seating with fans. The best street food in Khaosen road.
We arrived here at peak dinner hour. However, the staff were helpful in getting us a table promptly.
Contrary to other Street vendors, their menu is really limited but made us wish we order every item.
Served on a cute bamboo platter, each dish is adequate for 1 person and hence priced accordingly. Quality, hygiene and taste was top notch.
You can enjoy the hustle of the Khaosen road while enjoying your meal we also enjoyed live music from next door cafe.
Must recommended in Khaosen !! The Mixed Fried Rice is excellent! Their shakes are also amazing we got strawberry, passionfruit, mango and they gave me a whole coconut! Still not sure if that was supposed to be made into a shake instead of sold whole We also got a squid fried rice and a spicy pork basil rice thing. While it was all delicious my american taste buds were not ready for thai spicy. The mango shake has bland taste. Pad thai was okay. I can get a better shake from other the stand on the same street with the same price. Ngl.
I would say this should be a Thai restaurant that surprises me THE MOST during the trip half of the trip now lmao
Tiny restaurant but exceedingly TASTY!
Pad Thai good!
Stir fried water morning glory wondrous!
Spicy glass noodles salad BLEW ME AWAY!
Watermelon and mango shake are completely outstanding!
10 out of 10!
Budget friendly, relatively large proportion.
I have been to NARA Thai cuisine. But I love this one more than NARA. TBH, this Thai restaurant is def a mustgo!","Monday: Closed

Cold beer, fresh hot food, quick and charming service, and great price  we sat outside to soak up some Bangkok atmosphere, which was great for us, but fully airconned inside if that is more you! Well worth a visit if you are in this neck of the woods! Loved it! Excellent visit  food! The place was packed with only few free tables, but they were able to handle the service very fast. Tasty food with reasonable prices. Awesome staff! Brought the family here for their first Thai meal, and it definitely did not disappoint! It was a good welcome meal especially that they have not had much Thai food previously. Highly recommended if youre in the area.

Minor comment the pad thai noodles were not as firm, probably slightly overcooked. Second visit of this restaurant in Bangkok on July 24.
We arrived at dinner time..Restaurant was pretty full because has just probably 89 tablesbut we got fast our table.
Our order arrived very fast and had good taste.

Excellent service that you can expect from a two Michelin stars establishment. I like the main course and their complimentary fresh baked sour dough bread. The special add on menu, the oyster from the chefs home town was creamily delicious. Other menus are creative. It was a great experience dining here. Great services and amazing view of the city. Food was very enjoyable, especially with the pairing. Great sommelier, who gave us a different wine for the dessert which we enjoyed a lot. Overall, among some of the best restaurants in Bangkok. My husband and I were delighted with this restaurant. Our friends also admire him
We were kindly given the best table in front of the open kitchen in honor of our wedding anniversary and were also given a wonderful dessert.
The workers are polite, speak good English and are professional.
We visited this place in December, the menu from the chef was magnificent I still can't forget the dish with sea urchin caviar, avocado and black caviar, and my husband dreams of the amazing Kobe beef You don't stay hungry, there are many dishes and each dish is special.
This place really deserves two Michelin stars, great experience! Thanks to the boss and his team for the work done By any measure, Good. Relative to others in the same price range, that is the question!

For a start, we would say that you Must do the wine or sake pairing. Without this, half the magic is lost. The sommelier has put some thought into trying to bring out flavours with the wine. That said, some pairings are better than others. The thing we like to look out for is when the resultant experience is greater than the sum of both parts food and winesake. This happened for some and not others. But nothing clashed, for sure.

If you're there with cooperative company, a good plan is to get 1 of each option and share. The staff don't seem to mind at all and even suggested this. What's the use in getting uptight about this anyway as we see in some Other places! We had the summer menu. All good. Truffle menu with Black truffles isn't our thing but that's just us white truffles are a different matter.

Interesting to note katsuramuki   cucumbers as opposed to dicon smoke infused Wagyu not just binchotan and not the usual Straw flamed stuff  good use of Koji shima I came to celebrate my girlfriends birthday, we had an amazing experience. The food was outstanding specially with the Japanese twist. I took the Sake pairing something rare but incredible. The service was very meticulous and attentive to detail I will be back for sure.","Monday: 6:00 PM – 12:00 AM

At first I thought the meals were a bit pricey but they are definitely worth what they cost. Not only is the food absolutely delicious but also beautifully presented and super colorful.

The ambience is lovely and the service very friendly. Must visit!

This restaurant is so good I came back 2 more times to try other dishes on the menu

Many vegan options, the food is delicious, but the presentation takes the cake. Beautifully served, I had to take photos of everything

The staff are super nice and friendly, there are cute cats and the place is just a great vibe

Also the coffee was the best so far in Bangkok for me The curry was mindblowingly delicious!! So many interesting ingredients and spices included. I was in heaven at this place. The staff was very kind and know the difference between vegan and vegetarian. I wish i could try everything. Dont miss it! Its the most delicious thing Ive eaten in Thailand so far. We absolutely loved it!
As somebody who has severe problems with dairy products and anxiety regarding unsafe foods and drinks i felt incredibly safe with the meals at Mango! I was so happy to have found the restaurant on my very first day in Thailand. I probably went there 34 times.
The food options are amazing and the size of the plates astronomical. You will definitely not be hungry afterwards! Drinks and desserts are also very enjoyable and delicious.
Bonus they had 2 cute cats that were in the front from time to time I've visited here a number of times over the years and have never been disappointed. The restaurant serves healthy vegan food in large portions at reasonable prices. Big enough to share! They also have gluten free options on the menu
It usually gets quite busy after 7pm, so go early to avoid the rush.
Today, we ate banana, gluten free pancakes with coconut ice cream, cruffle with fruit, coconut ice cream and chocolate sauce. Fruity som tam.
There is a range of drinks on offer including herbal tea. I highly recommend adding this place to your list","Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Staff service is friendly and excellent. I like the magic so much while waiting the food. Id highly recommended this restaurant. We were very happy to come. Hello my fellow followers and everyone else who want to read this review!

I never knew this restaurant existed but I was really intrigued by the name and lo and behold I took my dinner group here last night for some really good Indian food!

We got 4 people to join our group and we had a great conversation we all ordered something little and it was tasty!

I was really hankering for the daal tharka fry with tandoori roti and I love it!  I asked for the onions and green chilies with lime on the side so I can put it inside my daal!

Some people ordered the MurgMalai and naan and other ordered a lamb kebab and one had the paneer also with naan!

Wine  beer  was plenty so it was a good conversation overall!

Best part was when the owner started showing us some magic tricks with cards it left us intrigued  and puzzled  and wowed !!

We had a really good time and had a good conversation with the owner Mr. Singh!

I would highly recommend if youre in the area to have a quick bite or a nice family meal it would be a really nice place to go for Indian food!!

 We read the reviews and happily were entertained by Mr Singh. The food is delicious and not the standard Indian. A big call out to the caring staff as our son had sore pool eyes. We took the leftovers home and they even included 3 plates and cutlery. Spotless, caring and tasty. We had 3 starters and 2 mains with garlic naan  and rice. I had the pleasure of dining at Indique, again on September 10th.  The food was absolutely delicious,  The seasonings were well balanced and the flavor superb.  It should be noted that the staff are very attentive and friendly.  I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that enjoys the taste of India.  This will be one of my new ""GoTo"" restaurants.  The location is also excellent as it is a very short walk from the Terminal 21 mall.  Truly enjoyable! Newly started Indian Restaurant. Food taste is good. A bit expensive 2 people 1000 THB ordered 3 items. Ambience is good and new place. Should try and checkout and only Indian restaurant on Sukhumvit Soi 19","Monday: 6:30 AM – 11:30 PM

Not street food cheap, but more in line with casual restaurant pricing. The flavors were great and not spicy, which some might appreciate. We had two curries, two pork dishes, and four drinks for 1100 baht. The downside? The ambiancebeing in a mall didnt add much charm, and the service was incredibly slow. But overall, the food made it worth a try! This place looks famous.  I have bookmarked it some times ago and finally I tried it.  I ordered lemon sauce fish and fried veggie.  The fish comes with a small fire to keep the fish and soup hot.  The fire will be gone about 5 minutes so it won't over cook the fish.  The fish is fresh and the size is right.  Both items are super tasty and both are a bit too spicy to me.  After the meal I feel thirsty so I guess the food is added with msg. First time trying Thai food in MBK mall. Despite what other reviews say, I thought the food was pretty good.  Papaya salad and morning glory were spicy as hell, but I still finished them because they were super delicious. Chicken wings and shrimp springrolls were pretty good, but a bit greasy.  Nonetheless, I thought it was pretty good value for money. I am going back for lunch. 6 ladies meal!

The food here is really affordable and very delicious!! We ordered
 5 bowls of steam rice
 2 Coke Zero, 1 lemonade, 1 Thai lemon tea, 1 Thai milk tea, 1 tomato juice
 Shrimp Cake very crispy and fluff
 Steamed Sea Bass very flavourful spicy  sour
 Egg Omelette not bad, fluff and not dry
 Rice cracker with dip the sauce is cold and not much minced meat
 Papaya Salad  Refreshing and flavourful one of the best so far!
 Tom Yum Soup Prawn we wanted the clear soup but it came with the red milky one. The soup was ok.
 Grilled Pork Shoulder Juicy, and mustorder
 Stir fried Cabbage in fish sauce could be cooked longer as it is a big crunchy full of Wok Hei taste!
 Mango Sticky Rice really creamy and nice
 Red Ruby if you like the ruby tapioca layer to be thinner and the chestnut to be huge bits then this is it! very fragrant!

Overall all the dishes are very very good! Must come and must try!

2756Baht This restaurant has moved from Siam Square to MBK. Tried several in their old location and first time trying it here in MBK. Their fried chicken wings is really crispy and delicious. Other dishes worth trying are the som tam, shrimp cake, steamed fish, fried cabbage and pineapple rice.

Can get a good meal for 80120 baht. Fast service at this very busy spot!! Locals  Tourists. They make fresh lime juice too, so I had a lime soda. It was fresh and 60 baht.

They have wifi  AC  fresh coconuts. Dedicated vegetarian menu, too! We stopped here to grab a bite while visiting the temples and palace, and take shelter from the heat. We had to line up, but not for long we were third in line and waited less than 10 min. Staff is welcoming and seems used to foreigners. Venue is a bit crowded but at a cool temperature.

Decently sized menu, we enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and green curry with pork. For some dishes like the curry you get to choose between mild and spicy but beware, we found the mild option was still quite spicy. Would come back again! Quick and friendly service. Limited seating area. Menu are all thai traditional dish. There's clean toilet inside. Perfect place to cool down after exploring Wat Pho, before crossing to Wat Arun. The coconut price is cheap, even cheaper than some street seller. Will come back if we are in the area next time. Pad kra pao and pad thai taste good, drinks are refreshing. Friendly staff, nice cool Aircon to cool down after visiting Sleeping Buddha.
Highly recommend the Thai Egg Omelette see pic! Wished I had more. Thai ice tea was legit tast too.  Thai curry was ok but too watery prefer thick gravy. Sweat sour was ok to good. Minced pork rice was nice and spicy. Came back 7 years later and pad Thai only increase by 10 baht ! Impressed and taste exquisite still  happy us!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 5:00 PM

There are some unusual dishes on the menu such as the pork rib in preserved rice flour, intensely seasoned bacony pork ribs served with a variety of raw vegetables and aromatics as pallet cleansers. My favourite was the braised duck with dumplings. The duck melted in the mouth, just the right amount of gamey taste and very juicy. The shrimp dumplings had very slippery casings but the shrimp.filling was awesome. Great meal at a reasonable price. Antique kinda chandelier and the down lights were charming the atmosphere one might miss. The staff were friendly and we were usher to our seats without delay. Orders were facilitated even with different languages. This restaurant is endorsed to be 9.510 by my 83yo Chinese dad. The 0.5 loss was due to the stir fry kailan with salted fish to be abit too salty. Both of us thumbs up on their mixed meat platter, especially their duck. Simply Mesmerising. A traditional Chinese restaurant in the heart of Bangkoks China Town suitable for killing the hunger after enjoying barhopping in the area. Authentic taste for me. Id give five stars if I didnt have to go out for an ATM to get cash to pay.  We were at Wat Arun. We took the ferry to Siam Center and then to Chinatown ferry stop. My daughter found this restaurant. She did an incredible job picking this location. The food was amazing. The service was on point. Prices are a bit steeper than traditional Thai restaurants, but it was worth it. We had a variety of dishes from BBQ pork sticky buns, shrimp spring rolls, chick3n dumplings, noodles with duck, and fried noodles with chicken. their food is not bad here, noodle is the most great among all the menu i ordered here, the roasted duck also good too

however to talk about their dimsums i guess not really for me, just ok only
and their dumplings is nah, disappointed coz the rice is uncooked inside and not hot at all

The breakfast buffet with one main cause start from 630 to 1030 every morning. I have stayed three nights in this hotel ASAI that means I had three breakfast buffets while I stay at hotel. The food is delicious and the service is good. Its more than I expected. One of the staff in restaurant named Guide is very nice with his good service. Actually the all staffs are very nice. As the food is delicious and the service is good, thats why I want to share with others. God blessed everyone. April 2024 Absolutely love the fried eggs and fried chicken skin at this restaurant! The combination is divine, and the flavors are unparalleled. A musttry for anyone looking for unique and delicious dishes. The service is excellent too.

July 2024 Back with friends so that I can tried more dishes. I highly recommend their fried egg salad This restaurant is located on the second floor of a hotel, and we were greeted upon arrival. The service was friendly but quite slow we had to wave them down to get utensils and water after our food arrived.

Now, onto the food everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! My favorites included 14 Nang Kai Tort, which is chicken skin that strangely tasted like potato chips but was very good 25 Moo Sam Chan, kojimarinated pork belly with excellent sauce and seasoning 25 Pad Gra Pao Nua, minced beef with basil and a fried egg and 36 Yum Kai Dao, a spicy salad with egg and toasted rice that burned my mouth but was impossible to stop eating. My least favorite was 12 Khao Niew, steamed sticky rice, which was bland and slightly too firm.

We also ordered a highball and a Sathorn Thai. However, the Sathorn Thai required multiple followups before it finally arrived, and it tasted like just gin and lemongrass because they seemed to have forgotten the brown sugar. After adding the brown sugar ourselves, it tasted much better. Overall, the food was good, and we are glad we got to try it. The total cost for everything we ordered was about 55 USD. Shaken, Stirred, and Seduced A Cocktail Masterclass at Asai Hotel

My recent cocktail workshop at Err bar in Asai Hotel was a delightful blend of education and indulgence. The inviting atmosphere of the bar, coupled with the expert guidance of the mixologist, made for an unforgettable experience.

The workshop began with a brief overview of the history and techniques of cocktail making. Our instructors Khun M and Khun Fluke were incredibly knowledgeable and passionate, sharing fascinating anecdotes and tips along the way. We then got down to business, learning how to prepare new recipe cocktails with melon and dragonfruit.

The handson experience was particularly enjoyable. We were provided with all the necessary tools and ingredients, and the instructor patiently guided us through each step of the process. It was a great opportunity to learn new skills and experiment with different flavors.

The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the tasting session. We had the chance to sample our creations and compare them to the instructor's expertly crafted cocktails. It was a delicious way to appreciate the nuances of each drink and to see how small changes can make a big difference.

Overall, the cocktail workshop here at Asai Hotel was a fantastic experience. Whether you're a seasoned cocktail enthusiast or just looking for something fun to do, I highly recommend checking it out. Food is great!! Staff is super friendly. We have had breakfast here two days in a row complimentary breakfast and they didnt disappoint at all!! My fave is the fried chicken sourdough and the passion fruit in the continental breakfast bar. We also received great help and warm welcome from staff especially Guide and Rudy!! Would love to stay here again ! Location of the hotel is excellent, its around 34 mins walk from the saint louis BTS station!! Only 4 stations from Siam.","Monday: 6:30 AM – 9:30 PM

The venue is the best part. It's really welcoming and relaxing. I can't say enough good things about So Samsen! From the moment you step in, you're greeted with warm smiles and an inviting atmosphere. The authentic Thai cuisine here is simply unparalleled. Every dish is bursting with flavor, from the spicy tom yum soup to the perfectly balanced pad Thai. The ingredients are always fresh, and the presentation is beautiful.

The staff at So Samsen are incredible. I come here quite often, and they always take amazing care of me. They go above and beyond to make sure you have an exceptional dining experience. They're attentive, friendly, and always ready with great recommendations. The ambiance is cozy and perfect for both intimate dinners and larger gatherings.

If you're in Bangkok and looking for an unforgettable meal, So Samsen is the place to be. It's a hidden gem that deserves all the recognition and more. I highly recommend it to anyone craving authentic Thai flavors. Your taste buds will thank you! The foods are delicious !! The drinks are strong and tasty !! Services are beyond standard, staff are friendly and very helpful. The Lady owner is very kind Love the decoration, would look great at a beach. Had the banana blossom salad and the green curry. Both were excellent. They have a good menu that covers a bit more than the standard tourist fare. Super great people, very nice and polite,great food and atmosphere,ok prices.We will come again when we come back in Bangkok","Monday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM

Good coffee.
Good menu for a full breakfast or something lighter.
Big western selection and a few thai options for breakfast.
Not busy when we went at about 9am each day.
Quick and fresh. Open kitchen.
Place always busy when we passed at night too.
Inside and outside seating offered. Overall great experience, friendly staff, great tasting food. Big portions for the money as well. Simply very nice Love this place. I have been there for both breakfast and dinner. Wide selection of foods from Thai to Mexican to pizzas you name it. Great place to chill to have a drink all day eatery really. The staff even though very friendly sometimes there's a language barrier but their kindness and willingness to take care of their guests makes up for it. Prices are a bit higher than usual but the quality is good. Sometimes there's live music there if you are lucky. Great place It was the second time now that I entered the restaurant through the hotel door and ordered the breakfast offer for hotel guests with extras. Because nobody asked if I wanted coffee or tea, I already knew something had gone wrong. I had to order my coffee later and again request the included fruit plate and water. The food is very good so far, but please train your staff. It's very disappointing. The food and the atmosphere here is very good. We had lunch here. They offer Thai food, as well as western food,burgers,pizza and fish and steak. We ordered vegetarian Thai fried rice which was delicious! And green chicken curry along with jasmine rice. Medium spice, really tasty, chicken very tender. Overall amazing! Price is also good. The waiters super nice.

I loved the sea food Thai fried rice names are different in Thai language, however I would recommend you try them. The portion quantity is perfect and it is not less or more. Food was served quick and the staff are super fast. They are too busy to even give you an eye contact which is understandable as the crowd as large. I will recommend you to try this place out if you are in this area. Great food, good atmosphere. We had authentic Pad Thai, Pineapple shrimp fried rice and spring rolls.

The product really fresh and matched with all ingredients. We were ordered five dishes it was really impressive.

Location Excellent along the river great executive view.

Service Opposite site with food comments. All staff,  doesn't have patterns of service and how to handle guests request, food or else. Staff needs to pay attention with customer as per many guests always wave their hands to ask for help. We went there last night. After food arrived on our table, no one come to care our table anymore once we need to order more food.

Their need to Training for customer service. We visited the place during lunchtime, it's beautiful. The food is good and affordable. It's more beautiful and romantic during sunset to dinner because of the lights surrounding the area, the bridge and  band music.
Staff are nice and accommodating too.   visited Monday, 7pm.
Sold out dishes Crab w Vermicilli, Small Crab w curry powder. River prawn small

Ordered
1 Chef Recommendation Vermicelli w prawn and veg. Super dry and unflavourful. Look at photo.
2 Tom Yum Soup  taste like Salt water, very little herbs used. absolutely disgusting.
3 Salted egg yolk squid  Overdose of garlic. no salted egg taste. squid texture acceptable.
4 Chef Recommendation Crab Omelette  Super dry. yucks.

Overall. great views 55. Great live band, volume just nice. Great place for drinks and finger food but not for serious dining. The location next to the river is great. There is live music. Service is friendly and efficient. The decor is practical and with high ceilings. Check the weather for rain. Book the Aircon room if it is going to rain. You can still get photos later. Food is average. Check the freshness of the river prawns. I was really looking forward to visiting this place, but unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. Some friends from Thailand had recommended it to me for my birthday, so I made a reservation. However, the service was subpar. They asked if I was alone, then moved me to a table by the side, took ages to take my order, and never brought me the bill, even when I requested it. They also mentioned that if I'd booked through Facebook, I'd get a free dessert for my birthday, which seemed odd. It felt like they prioritized tables with bigger groups, which didn't align with my expectations of Thai hospitality. The venue itself is lovely, and the ambiance is great, but they could improve the service to make it a better experience for customers, especially solo visitors like myself.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 12:00 AM

I had the chicken pad thai today but will try other Pad Thai from this restaurant and will edit and give added review

Second day, Shrimp with Fried Noodles, restaurant's specialty!!!

I absolutely highly highly recommend this restaurant  SUPER! Crispy pad thai was amazing. One of our favourite pad thai in Thailand or abroad. Friendly service. Went before lunch around 11am and the place was empty but they were very welcoming and we had a delicious meal. Amazing shrimp pad thai! My friend doesn't eat vegetables and they did some fried noodles with only chicken because of that, also very good. The staff is extremely nice and friendly! First time to visit here. I ordered Pad Thai crispy noodles , it was so good. Highly recommended if you guys want to try a fun and yummy dish.You better try this restaurant!!  Great food! This place has a great atmosphere as well as phenomenal service. They are always willing to help and answer questions. Not to mention the food is great as well. They make the best original crispy pad Thai and the tea is really refreshing. 1010 would eat again","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

The biggest draw here is its version of Mama Tom Yum noodles. If you stripe it all down, its just instant noodles but, Jeho Chula elevates this humble dish into something entirely different.. it came out amazing. Dont forget to order the raw salmon and roast pork as well.

Go try it at least once when youre in Bangkok. Overcrowded but good food. We had our luck , when we came this restaurant and no wait time no queue.
We came in the right time and right moment.
The food really good, a very good thai food.
We ordered 
 tom yum noodle soup
 spicy salmon salad
 sausage
 crispy pork
All good and awesome.
We will come back here again someday. Be prepared for a long line, but the food is definitely worth it! I was lucky and didnt have to wait too long that evening. We loved everything we ordered. I recommend to come with some friends so that you could try different dishes. The Mama Tom Yum noodle soup is a must! Ill come back again to try other dishes, with the Mama Tom Yum noodle soup for sure! Yummy local fare but be prepared to wait. There was a long line of people waiting on a midweek evening at about 5.30pm. go straight to the counter near the door to get a number then explore the many kiosks and eateries in the area before returning to wait for your number to be called. The tom yam noodle was very good. The pork had crispy skin and comes in big chunks, delicious. Worth the wait. We were curious to try the food since there were so many people lining up. We took a number and waited about 30 minutes to get a table. We ordered noodle soup, prawns, and fried scallops.

Noodles 8.510
Generous portions with a comforting, slightly sour but refreshing broth. Ill definitely order it again.

Prawns 910
Fresh prawns with a mild to medium spiciness and good portions.

Fried Scallops 710
I would have preferred them grilled instead of fried.

Not worth the queue. The best dish however was the pork boar noodles whereby the broth and meat was pretty tender.
Do not, and I reiterate do not order any other sides. Take my word for it. Hands down, this is the best Thai food I've ever had!! This place has truly set the bar high. We tried a variety of dishes from the menu, and everything was delicious! My first bite of Chicken Larb with white rice was amazing! The aroma of fresh basil was simply intoxicating. The shrimp pad thai, Thailands national dish, was really good. And those wings? Perfection! They had just the right balance of crispness and tenderness, without being greasy. Also, if you get the chance to sit on those high chairs facing the bustling city of Bangkok, it's definitely an experience.

I would give this place more than 5 stars  We had a fantastic family dinner at this excellent Thai restaurant. The food was authentic and flavorful, offering a true taste of Thai cuisine. However, the restaurant was quite popular, and we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. Despite the wait, the dining experience was worth it, and the service was attentive once we were seated. Highly recommend it for a family meal. Came out for breakfast here good price good food especially for breakfast.

Braised beef noodle was great, curry noodle was alright, and mango smoothie and Thai milk tea also great as well. 

PS. You can pay with credit card if total order is over 200 baht. Location in Sukhumvit area, very close to Nana station

Food too spicy for me. We ordered seafood vermicilis salad, chicken with rice, chicken green curry fried rice, thai milk tea. The salad was delicious really spicy though. The rice was okay, nothing special, too spicy I could not finish.

Price reasonable. Food portion is generous.

Atmosphere the restaurant was full when we come for dinner. Had to queue for about 510 mins. The restaurant is an openspace type, no aircon so it can get very hot during the day. It was really noisy since the restaurant was full, plus noise from the vehicles going by from the main road.

They had a togo mango sticky rice booth in front of the restaurant that look promising. We didn't try though.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 4:00 AM

This is real royal cuisine open for public. Taste is authentic full and complex flavours.

If you never taste real royal Thai cuisine, please come to this restaurant first.

Staff's maner are very polite as used to work with royal before. Came here as the dishes were meant for royals. Beautiful dining place and great service provided. Love the deep fried corn and fried fish with crispy garlic. The Chinese kale leaves were too thick for meang kam, better with bai cha pluwild pepper leaves. The red curry with roasted duck is more to the sweet side. The jello with rambutan was good. Excellent traditional Thai food. I had Khao Cher which only serves during summer months but apparently you can call ahead and ask them to make for you all year round.

The downside is the place is an owner's house so it can get crowded easily and the price is quite high. Almost can transport you back in time with the setting of a 70s fine dining restaurant.  Food is a bit too sweet for my taste and presentation is lacking compared to its price. For our last night in Thailand we hit the jackpot. This was hands down our best meal on this trip.

The restaurant is charming and quaint with a history. It was named in honour of Her Serene Highness Princess SulabhValleng Visuddhi who was once the head cook in the Sumhothai Palace for her sister.

We tried three dishes and all three were outstanding.

Tofu with basil and chili  packed with flavor.

Roasted duck red curry  they used pineapple instead of lychee. It had a nice hint of sweetness to it. The duck was cooked perfectly.

Massaman curry with chicken  well balanced and flavorful.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:00 PM

The portions were generous, but the flavor was just okayIve had better. The place wasnt too crowded when we arrived, with only two other customers.

However, I was a bit disappointed that the owner rushed us out, saying she was expecting more customers. We had ordered a lot and hadnt been seated for long, so it felt unfortunate. That said, it was still worth trying, especially since they offer good vegan options. Also the price is relatively cheap. We came first to have the green curry for dinner, which was spectacular. As a Brazilian I had to try the mango smoothie, it was so good that I had to return to have lunch.
It was equally great, we had pork omelet, fried chicken with cashew nuts with rice and fried egg.
Were going to be back to try other dishes at Jeng Noodle, for sure its going to be always a tasty experience. A restaurant that uses five ants for seasoning.
A restaurant that urges sales and obsesses under the guise of laughter.
It's been less than 10 seconds since I sat down, so I'm not ordering quickly.
It's a good restaurant that allows you to clean up your plates and pay quickly before the meal is over.
It is a restaurant that turns off the fan and saves electricity as soon as the spoon is put down.
Due to the nature of the president who prefers white people, it is a restaurant that offers all kinds of items to other white customers, from menus in front of the table to tissues.
A restaurant that allows Europeans sitting on paddy fields on other tables with many seats to sit down to evict other customers.
It's a good restaurant with lots of bugs and fly mosquitoes.
It was the same when I visited for the first time, and when I ate with my friend, the owner let me use an umbrella and delayed it for more than 10 minutes without the customer's permission even when the customer had to move.
There was no apology at all, but rather, the old grandfather's owner got angry because he got rained on.
The owner's wife acts like she takes it for granted.
a restaurant that avoids Asians and prefers white people.
If it's okay to receive this service, it's a restaurant I recommend.
It would be good for visitors to refer to it as a must. This is a great little place for some quick, easy, tasty and cheap food. The staff are very friendly and food is cooked and served really quickly. Beers are nice and chilled and they have a good list of other drink options. Some of the reviews here are judging the place with the wrong criteria  you want top gourmet Thai food? Go and pay top prices somewhere else!! Duh! All of the dishes we had were very tasty all vegetarian and the Papaya Salad had a nice spicy kick too! They actually have a completely separate menu for their vegetarian choices  how cool is that??

It's a small business run by a family with just a few employees. Don't miss their signature grilled pork dish, served with fresh vegetables, side dishes, and Gochujang sauce. While other menu items are good, they often blend in Thai flavors to cater to local tastes. If it's busy, the food might take a bit longer. The staff, mostly aunties, do their best to take care of every guest. This Korean restaurant located along the extended Khao San Road, known as DongDaeMoon, is truly authentic. The owner, originally from Korea, imports a diverse range of genuine Korean flavors. The variety of dishes captivates tourists who can't resist walking in.

While the threetier pork buffet might be overwhelming, opting for the pregrilled option is recommended.

After indulging in the extensive menu, the fried chicken brought to the table is a musttry  succulent, crispy, salty, and sweet.

A visit to this place, tucked away near Rambuttri Alley, promises a delightful Korean culinary experience with reasonable prices. Highly recommended for those seeking delicious Korean cuisine while exploring the Khao San area. food is soooo yum and they gave us a few things to try for free! so sweet and nice family atmosphere. fried chicken is incredible got two orders For this one is good for buffet 290bathpax exclude drinking. I had tried only buffet here never tried a la carte before. I was here 2 times with my best friend . The sides which come along in buffet is not that bad 3 sides and you can feel it unlimited. Buffet itself has only fat belly pork which you cannot put any sauce on it while you are grilled it. I am not sure if that point because the staffs are lazy to clean or that is a rule as my first time I met with owner , he saw that we put some sauce on fat belly pork on the pan . He said how do you know to do that ? I said my friend was made me once in Korea after that the staff came to blame us that you cannot do that. It still on my mind until now . For a la carte I think you should try another Korean restaurant which not far from this place. the first time i visited this place, i got to meet the owners. they were very nice and welcoming. the food servers are also very accommodating. the food is great! i especially love the side dishes, the fried chicken, and japchae.

We were starving to death that we could only appreciate the kind service of the male staff who tried so hard to talk to us in English. We had stir fried dishes and pad Thai, the taste was okay but you need the side condiments to better the flavor. The fruit smoothies were not that bad either. The server receiving the order was very kind. It was good because it was cheap and tasted good. Stirfried Morning Glory and Pad Thai were especially delicious. But I was disappointed that the shrimp in the fried rice smelled a bit fishy smell. You have to eat Tangmo Pan no matter what. We came in for the mango sticky rice as it was late and at least we had a place to sit, the prices were great the mango sticky rice at 50 tbh and the large beer at 100 tbh but the portion of rice it was extremely small and half mango only. We came the day after for some smoothies and if youre coming for a smoothie here be careful as they are using syrup instead and not fresh fruits!! One of the smoothies had two syrups and yogurt and you can clearly see on the photo the final result and when we asked him how much it was he wanted to charges more than what it was and it was not even done with fresh fruit. Go better in the front stalls they have proper fruits for the smoothies and mango sticky rice at the same price with better portions. During the night it was quite unpleasant it was this young Indian guy all the times with the laughing balloons which it was pretty annoying. Amazing food on khaosan road , the lady that works here is very friendly and even helped to get a group of men away from us , if you are staying near khaosan road I definitely recommend here. It is open late aswell which is amazing. Amazing authentic Thai food that accommodated to our dietary requirements of being vegetarian aswell. Couldnt recommend more xxxx Cheapest meal I found on Khao San Road, and I got what I paid for. The noodles were fairly bland and didn't come with lime or sprouts to help. The egg white wasn't fully cooked, but there was nothing offensive about the the flavor and chili and peanuts were at the table.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Lamb ShawarmaHummusmutabal are perfectly done well. Food s tasty. You can add on saladchips dip as you wish.

Order Mintlime drink with the meal. It s a good combination with the food. The price is reasonable compared to the portion and quality. Dont forget to try chocolate lava as dessert.

Very homy place and service is great too.

Ps. You can order to take away pita and walked around the old town too. Tried the chicken schnitzel, and falafel pita. Both dishes were fresh and delicious. The hummus , salad and fries were tasty and food compliments to the meals. Pita bread was soft and delicious. Food was great, had thai pad with shrimps and soup. Gf got mussels. Good prices! I visited there with my Israeli friend.
She has been there many times and I think it means the food is really good.
I actually liked their foods, too. It was before more then 30 years when I first  visited this restaurant with Israeli food.. I remember at that time after finishing that legendary plate humus,falafel, chips, salad  pita bread often I remain hungry because portions was so small..
But this year after 5 years I return to Bangkok and of course comeback again to Shoshanna already 3,4 times..But this time
portions was so big that maybe 2 times I couldn't finish all plate because they were too big...!!
Food was very good  and this time they also served with bottle of olives oil...
I told Shoshana, owner of this place about this facts and congrats her...","Monday: 10:30 AM – 11:00 PM

I love this place so much, that decided to celebrate my birthday here. The management was very kind and proposed me the whole floor! My friends very amazing by the quality and general vibes of the place, so all in all it was a blast! Olive Kitchen is a great, reliable and clean place to eat! We had a chickenmango bowl, shrimppineapple rice and burrata  all three were surprisingly tasty and healthy.
The staff was super accommodating and the vibe was calm and lovely.
Must visit! 55! Great ThaiItalian restaurant! I tried the mangosalsa and it was awesome, The price's fair compared to the quality of food and their staff is nice and welcoming. Great place to stop by and chill out! Highly recommended. Guys, you want to eat a good pizza Neapolitan style? Go to that place! Very attentive service and best pizza we had in Bangkok.  Excellent choice of local and regional IPAs. In a quiet corner away from the din of Khaosan, which is absolutely the reason I landed up here.

It was by chance that we visited there, so much surprise, in a hidden place.

Authentic Thai food, many choices, very welcoming service.

All the dishes in the pictures are fully recommended.

Its an address to be saved. Small but cute restaurant nestled away from the main road. I order the pad Thai, spicy papaya salad, and passion fruit smoothie and they all tasted great! My server was friendly and chatty which was nice whilst solo. Would highly recommend refueling here after a class at Thanomsak Boxing Club around the corner! Off the beaten path, a really good surprise. Simple but delicious food. All the classics of Thai cuisine in a relax atmosphere. I came here with my family and everyone was so disappointed  Even the manager was very kind, he forgot our order two times and theres only one person who was cooking for everyone and she kept talking with other employees and neighbors while some customers were waiting for a long time. Tom yum noodle was good but others were just okay. Oh smoothie is very good! The place I aimed for was closed so we came here as a second option and I havent checked the menu previously as I usually do, being vegan I like to know what to expect. The menu was in pictures, hard to understand exactly what is what, but the waiter is glad to explain and give recommendations. I ordered a vegetable fried rice without the egg, he asked if i wanted tofu with it  always nice.
Food was good, nothing crazy, but not too fatty, good size portion and I really enjoyed the atmosphere!","Monday: 10:30 AM – 8:00 PM

Service was top notch, the friendly atmosphere is very inviting. I had the shrimp tom yum soup and it was the kind of meal that warmed me to the bone. And you also get a complementary serving of mangoes as an appetizer. I bought a tiny pink clay elephant to remember my trip, and as a memento to the wonderful dinner I had here. Definitely a core memory for me in Bangkok! Was searching for Authentic Thai food. I m bit hygiene freak. This place is super clean, food looks super fresh and taste super yum. Most important thing is they don't use MSG. The food portions are very good. Complimentary sweet mango was enough for me as dessert. Will definitely come back here. Excellent food.
The menu is extensive with all your favourite Thai dishes.
They have a separate vegetarian and vegan section.
The food was fantastic, and the portions were HUGE!
Definitely worth checking out.
The staff were nice and the place has a nice atmosphere, with chilled music. My wife and I have now been to  6 times and we have always eaten incredibly good food.
The food in this restaurant is of a different quality.
We are skeptical about restaurants in Thailand and only eat street food. But this restaurant really impressed us and blew us away with the taste.
The prices are of course expensive by Thai standards. But the food is worth every penny and we can recommend the restaurant without hesitation!
The ambience in the restaurant is also very appealing. Me and my partner had a wonderful dining experience here! The food was delicious and exceeded my expectations. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, making our visit even more enjoyable. The ambiance was perfect for a relaxing meal.

Lovely restaurant in the garden indoor and outdoor available Ive been to this restaurant at other branches but would say this one has a big lovely cozy space.  There are many choices of Thai food.

Car parking is available next to the restaurant, but if you park more than 1.5 hours, you have to pay 50thb fee  Our family have been regulars here for more than 40 years. The food continues to taste good. Lots of varieties and cakes are the best! Well worth the visit. Very easy to get to and plenty of parking.

Back again. Still yummy  This is a really good restaurant.

I have been multiple times to this wonderful restaurant and can honestly say it is the best food around for miles. Ive never had a bad meal. The staff are all wonderful and so friendly! Highly recommend to anyone looking for top quality, authentic food in Thailand. The food is amazing, among the things I ate here I must say that the Tom yum was one of the best I had here in Thailand. Staff is friendly and nice. They could improve the bathroom tho. A good restaurant  a combination between Thai and Indian kitchen. The food was tasty and well seasoned. The papaya salad was little bit to spicy to our taste. The stir fry vegetables with cashews were amazing. The panang curry with shrimps was also great. The chicken curry was also nice. Overall a great experience. This little street food location is absolutely what you were looking for.

After landing in Bangkok and leaving the hotel for the first time we found this little kiosk that serves typical Thai food.

The shrimp pad Thai is breathtaking and the sweet and sour chicken keeps the pace well.

Location is immersed in a very local set and service is nice. A decent restaurant if youre looking to try some very unique and interesting flavors as well as some of the most popular dishes from Thailand and India for very decent prices.

Very tasty food available for dine in or takeout. Seafood was tasty but a little overcooked. The pad thai was a little mushy but the taste was good. Cold Indian tee was delicious.

If your not a fan of spice you can also ask for less spicy which is great if your a fan of papaya salad but cant handle too much spice. Would deffo recommend the pad Thai and papaya salad. I decided to eat here as this place was near my hotel and it seemed to be always full of people. I value a good meal and it didnt disappoint. My Pad Thai was delicious, the portion was big and the price was very fair! Many traditional Thai food options. I would come again, great local eatery option if you are in the area Remember when food used to be uncomplicated and simply delicious and fresh without the pressure of having to be social media worthy?
Well, here you have it. I have been so tired of eating out and I came across this place late at night after watching Muay Thai fights. I was a bit skeptical due to being in a calm dark alley, but Im glad I trusted the reviews. I had young coconut milk smoothie, chicken satay and papaya salad. Everything was delicious. The smoothie took me by surprise, I didnt expect to like it this much.
Give it a try they also have English translation on their menus a huge plus for me. Only negative is no AC. But they have plenty of fans on. The food came out quicker than expected, I would say within 5 mins for the spring rolls we had and 10 for the pad Thai! Absolutely lovely staff and the mango shake was delicious. For our first Thai dinner in Bangkok it did not disappoint! Was close to my hotel and tried it out. It was a great experience. The fried chicken was absolutely delicious, red curry was very fragrant and not too spicy as well. Recommended to all.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 AM

The spread is good with varieties of choices. The self served meat  seafood corner is impressive. Surprisingly the quality of meat seafood is unexpected. They have Hokkaido beef, Aussie beef and river prawns etc. very into detailed thats using different containers to classify the cooking methods. Oysters are also fresh. Drinks and desserts are also nice.

Tables are set with distance which provide a cozy experience. Great experience, booked on eatigo with a discount so makes it much more value for money!
Great atmosphere, very nice decor!
Staff super friendly and happy to serve both chefs and wait staff.
The cook to order seafood and meat is unreal!
Fresh and cooked perfectly.
I wish there was abit of a larger range of cooked food. Korean oysters was abit of a letdown. Fresh but not so tasty.
Nonetheless still great experience! Very good value for money booked through Eatigo, staff were very friendly and helpful, lots of seafood and beef choices, plenty of Thai food options as well.
Really liked the juice bar!
Certainly will come back again in the near future. I booked through Eatigo that gave me a deal! The staff was thoroughly helpful from booking to bill payment. They were very prompt to clear the table too so we can bring in more dishes. Kudos!

Ambience was wonderful  the seafood wall was the most notable, followed by the dessert spread and the juice corner.

Spent under 3,000 Thai Baht for 2 pax on a nice Sunday afternoon. This is the place for wonderful seafood buffet! One of the best buffet by Marriott, i came few time and quite like it, carful with the parking lot it is abit tight, the restaurant on the 3rd floor cost per head 2400 for buffet lunch.

Delicious! Pad Thai was great but it was kinda spicy for me.  Will definitely go back here. Nice food, the waiter was really nice with us !  The spiciness of the food was perfect for us !

Still to this day she is my 1st stop in Bangkok. I will travel whole Thailand but will only eat the Pad Thai made by her.  Her Pad Thai is made with so much love. The ingredients are super fresh. The portions are perfect. You can add extra peanuts, dried shrimps ... Super nice chicken and egg Pad Thai at 50B. Delicious and super tasty. You gotta try it! It is located at Khao San Road market.

Super affordable and delicious 
Cherry and her Mother who also work the stall have a good understanding of vegan pahthai ie no eggs, no fish sauce etc etc.

We went back several times!

however, the highlight would be hansang bbq pork set if i remembered its name correctly, which only served for the limit number of set per day.
the set was very good. bbq  pork was delicious. the set even came with water and bingo. it was a good refresh after the meal.

The atmosphere was comforting and casual. A great choice for a fast meal for 24 or even solo.

The taste was sharp and refined. The variety the sauces, and the components were fun and enjoyable. The kimchi was the best,  not only the taste which incorporate saltiness but also the sesame oil which makes it so appealing. I cant stop eating kimchi here!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

And awesome cocktails and mocktails. Definately will come again. Bit more expensive but worth it. I'm an Italian chef working in phrom pom, this place it's a tourist trap!!!

The food was nowhere near as good as last time. The Red Curry that I ordered was pretty pale and not creamy. It was really nothing special at all. Came here for supper after landing in bangkok as it was near our stay. As it was nearing their closing time so there were limited dish left. However, it was good enough! The crab omelette with curry powder is a must! ended up ordering 2 more portion of the same omelette because its so good. Their orange juice is 30 baht and its quite good as well

located in the alley of the noisy street, this place is definitely a hidden gem Super tasty Thai food at reasonably prices!! We ordered Fried Snapper with Chili Sauce and were blown away by the crispy texture and the sour and spicy taste! Such a nice and appetising dish for hot weather!

The coconut chicken soup is the best one Ive ever tasted. Its made of fresh coconut juice, instead of coconut milk  its light and has natural sweetness!

This place is a hidden gem in Sukhumvit area where you can taste authentic home cooking Thai food at good value! Located in a small alley, this restaurant seems to be popular among the locals and tourists.

Ordered a fried fish, pai thai, vegetable, crab omelette, plain rice and the total price was 600 bhat which was reasonable pricing for two person. Do check the pricing of the fish as it is not listed in the menu which I assume is seasonal price.

Additional info There's a resident cat but it's not really that friendly.  I was looking on Google Maps and found this wonderful restaurant. I was staying down the Soi at Hopeland Hotel and decided to give it a try. I met my daughter and her coworker for lunch.

Although the portion of the noodles are quite small, but the meat whether you order chicken or grill pork collar, its absolutely stunning. Very unique flavour and tender to the mouth too.

Services are quite good as everyone here is attentive. Ordered Pad Thai w White Shrimp  Pad Thai w Signature Iberico Pork. The pad Thai is absolutely delicious and the shrimps are huge. The pork is great, and the skin is really crispy. However, youll get sick of the crispy skin easily. Portions are small and leave you wanting more of the Pad Thai noodles! The interior is also pretty cool and slightly retro. If you have to pick 1 dish, go for Pad Thai w White Shrimp! I had Iberian pork jowl.
1st impressions this is soo tiiiny!! And expensive!
1st bite just take my money, this is of the best pork I've ever had, this dish just switched my brain off. It was so good I ordered a white shrimp pad thai next  this was real good as well! The shrimp was like caramelized and very good, but still... The pork was unbeatable.. like how is this pork... Just, just no words. Amazing gastronomic experience. I am still shocked at the quality of what I've just had... Absolutely delicious. Unique flavour profile for pad Thai. Not surprised they keep getting Michelin recognition! On a Saturday night at 830, there was plenty of seating. Pad Thai portions are on the smaller size but still sufficient for a meal. Prepared super quickly. A bit spicy. 130 baht, but this was one of the cheapest things on the menu. A Pad Thai restaurant around Democracy Monument area. The quality of foods was good. Using fresh quality of pork jowl, crispy pork, and shrimp. Pad Thai was tasty. Attentive service.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Some of the dishes were excellent, with the star of the show being the papaya salad with blue crab. The shredded pork noodles felt a little bland in comparison but overall this place has a huge array of authentic Thai dishes to choose from at a great price. The noodles with mackerel were also another table favourite. The only downside is food is brought out when ready and placed on the table without being told what it is, so it can get a little confusing trying to workout whose dish is whose. Ill definitely be back to try more from this menu. Unusual dishes but they tasted so good. Every dish we had was excellent. Very busy but informal. Can see why it is a Michelin guide regular. Price was fair and we tried a lot of food from the menu as it was one of the more interesting ones we came across in Bangkok. One of the best Somtam I tried in Bangkok.
 young coconut with shrimp somtam tastes very subtle and spicy. Yet, all the gentle sweetness, sourness, saltiness, unique smell of fish saucenot the funky type are all there!
 their signature somtam also uses the fermented fish brown color sauce but it literally helps bring your dead appetite back to life!!! Must try
 the gengsom? was also very spicy and good.

Overall, the food is amazingly good. If you are not good with spicy, please ask for level 1 spicy!  Michelinawarded shop, though, I was able to have a seat without booking, maybe it was a bit late hours and also shop has many tables.
Mood is very good. especially the sounds of crush nuts and hot peppers made good BGM.

There are so many menus with reasonable price.
Papaya salad is must.
Also I loved coconuts icecream which tastes very thick.
I will definitely come back! One of my favourite restaurants in BKK.
This was my second time visiting, my first being about eight years ago.
Since then they have renovated the restaurant and became apart of the Michelin Guide congratulations team!.
I did not know this before we arrived, so it was very busy.
I asked the host if I could drink a beer outside while we waited, which he said yes and bought it out to me 
We only had to wait for about thirty minutes before a table was available.

The food was delicious!
Our whole fried fish was cooked to perfection and the som tum was great with an awesome amount of chilli. We also loved the crispy porkrice entree and the corn salad this had fish roe in it which was a nice surprise!.

The service was great, every staff member was working hard and they were all very nice.

The restaurant has great air conditioning, it was extremely clean and good bathrooms.

Everytime I am back in Bangkok, I will always visit this restaurant.

Aroi mak mak!

An update we came back after a few weeks in Thailand and this was one of our favorite restaurants. Amazing food and prices. This is a Korean restaurant that is a gem in the Khaosan area.  It is said that it has been in business since 1995.  If you want to eat real authentic Korean food, definitely go to this place.  It is Korean restaurant common manners that when you order a main dish, many kinds of side dishes and soup are provided free of charge.  I enjoyed grilled mackerel in a cool, clean atmosphere in this restaurant. Bangkok has incredibly delicious Korean cuisine, very tasty and cheap!! A very cozy place with a good atmosphere Restaurant
The owner is super nice guy. You get the appetizer in the form of a tiny bowls of veggies and kimchi, which is very good and filling.
Also a bottle of a barsley tea with ice filled glasses.
The food is very good, healthy and for the quality, very cheap.

Overall, everything was very nice. Very clean and cozy restaurant. The apetizer are amazing and we appreciated the tea as well! The food is very good but the kimchi pancake could be more fried.
The owner is really kind and friendly, would definitely recommend!!! Price is also very cheap, would definitely come back!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM

Service  they provide good service. Food served fast after I ordered.

Atmosphere  table are big, spacious. The Tom yum soup was great and it tasted really good, the fish dish we ordered didnt taste good at all, could be that it was my first time here and didnt know exactly what to order. The service was slow, took some effort to get waiters attention although the place wasnt as busy as how you would normally see it. Might try again Authentic Thai fare in a nice restaurant located at a high end mall  Central Embassy. Good variety in the  menu to select from. Our all time favourite is the beef green curry platter, absolutely moist slices of beef in a delicious green curry, served with vermicelli, cucumber and bean sprouts. Chicken in white coconut broth go so well with rice. Overall an enjoyable meal at slightly higher prices, but worth it. thaifood bangkokrestaurant Just walk into this place and it was a pleasant surprised. Food quality was really good,  drinks were really nice.  Too much food,  no room for dessert.  Will come back to try. Decent Thai food inside central embassy mall. Not as busy as other locations.

I've had yellow crab curry at many other restaurants but this one is the best. The portion size is also very big a small is enough for 24 people. The other dishes are also good but not as special as the crab curry. I like to come here for the curry and skip the rest of the menu. We enjoyed our dinner here. It was extremely busy so recommend making a reservation. The curry crab was delicious, as was the kangkong. The prawn beehoon and river prawns were quite fresh but not our favourite, perhaps due to the different flavour profile. Overall we thought pricing was fair, way cheaper than Singapore for the quality. One of the best restaurants in Bangkok Ive tried!
For the hot plate oyster omelette, its just so good! The omelette was tender with good smell from onion and white pepper. The oyster was juicy and fresh, the best oyster omelette Ive tried in last 3 years!
The curry crab comes with a lot of sauce, you better order rice to mix with the sauce. Its not spicy at all so you can feel the freshness from the crab! The taste is not heavy, its right amount of softness, definitely want to try again!
Pork rib is just okay, not bad and nothing to shout about. Waitress or floor manager helped me pick a meal big enough for 1. Portions very big. Very flavourful and worth the price. The grab curry plus the green chili sauce makes a perfect combo. Would definitely go again. Fish, curry, rice and beer for 33. Crab meat curry and oyster omlette!!!! No one will be disappointed with these. Service is a bit like they are tired of all these people coming for their food. Like ok but not super happy to have you. Even when the dining hall is half empty. But crab meat curry is worth this grumpy service experience.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM

The staff is very friendly and attentive, unlike quite a few of the competitors who beg you to come in and then never give you a smile or check on you.  Maya, who seems to be in charge there is sweet and personable with many of the customers.
Prices are on the lower competitive side with the rest. We had drinks here one evening and the atmosphere was fantastic. There was a singer also playing a guitar and he really created a fantastic atmosphere. The cocktails are nice and the happy hour drinks make the prices better. My favourite restaurant and bar in Rambuttri Village.  Friendly and kind service staff and very good food and drinks at reasonable prices.  They have the best American breakfast set you can get in this area. Moreover, it's a very nice spot in the evening to have a snack or drink and watch tourists passing by. Loved the live entertainment.
There's also a large screen tv for people wanting to catch up on sports  Manchester City vs  Arsenal.
Fried crispy fish was ok as was the morning glory. We also had dragon fruit juice and mango juice.
There is indoor and outdoor dining.
The place has a laid back welcoming ambience.
It's a fun place to people watch  next to street stalls and passing traffic  including guy driving a very shiny tuk tuk with a large dog in it.
This is a mostly pedestrian thoroughfare but you get the occasional vehicle. Very kind service and a PlayStation with FIFA to enjoy a great time playing. You can choose between a lot of menus with Appetizer, Main Course and Beer for 300 Baht

From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed with warm smiles and a cozy atmosphere.

The food was spectacular, with each dish offering a delightful blend of flavors. The ingredients were fresh, and the presentation was beautiful. Every bite showcased the chefs skill.

The service was equally impressive. The staff were attentive, knowledgeable, and passionate about making sure every guest had a great time. They offered helpful recommendations and accommodated special requests with professionalism.

In conclusion, Yo Giyo Restaurant excels in both food and service. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking a topnotch dining experience. The first time I ate Korean food in my life was actually in Thailand. All the food is very delicious, especially the pig's feet. The beautiful lady boss is very kind and her English is also very good. I will come back again. The Chicken was very crispy and flavourful and the spicy sauce on the noodles was excellent The workers are very nice too. The seats are comfy and it's an amazing and affordable place to eat with friends and family. I loved everything I tried there Five stars is not enough to express how good my experience was Nice, authentic and affordable traditional Korean cuisine.

Service was timely, waiters were very attentive and in particular, the lady boss was very kind, friendly and hospitable.
Strongly recommended, especially for all authentic Korean food lovers. I brought my 10 coworkers to dine in at this korean restaurant after a long day of work. We were greeted by a smile and joy.

Disappointed with my experience at Lucy Club Bangkok. Arrived around 11 PM, and the place was almost empty with no crowd or vibe. Ended up having to head over to Thonglor for a better nightlife scene. Not the best spot if youre looking for a lively atmosphere. I genuinely rate this 2 star so people will read this review.

The place is a scam. They told us it was full and it genuinely had 3 people in there. Upon exiting and complaining they then claimed they told us it wasn't full.

Following this we asked for our free drinks and a Greek looking owner emerged and proceeded to physically assault me and my friend. Attached are photos of the injuries we exhibited.

In future I would advice Lucy club bankok to accurately reflect the business of their club, and not use false business tactics to entice tourists. It is also illegal to attack people who call you out on this. Worst pub ever! Please dont visit, DJ is good but put is too small. We cant even dance properly. Its not pub its discotechth.

I have never seen such impudence from a bartender. We ordered a classic cocktail. They put a block of ice in the glass, the same volume as the glass itself. There was nothing to drink, after two smoothies the drink was gone and minus 500 baht. A regular 0.5 liter bottle of water  100 baht.

It was as if there were no waiters, everyone was standing along the wall. Our table was wet throughout the rest. The contingent  Thai youth students. What acoustics to another level DJ and music depends the day you choose to come no entry fee but prices are expensive for the drinks you need deep pockets The shop is very fun. Enjoy it to the max. My friends are happy and dance to it. I with my 1000th visits here at Echelon. Nice songs and vibe. Good place to hang out with your friends. Not so crowded but fun still. Reasonable price for drinks 100 outta 10!!! Unique concept of daily party flights boarding from one of its kind cocktail bar and night club concept ! Its an amazing cocktail bar in the evening that turns into a happening night club by night and treats you with the best of dining and music experience!
They welcome  you with boarding passes of your name written on it and you celebrate with them whole night woohoo !

The vibe is electric with awesome DJs, great music, and a fun crowd. Drinks are wellpriced, and the service is quick. Just make sure you have a valid ID like a passport for entry. Perfect place for a great night out! Don't come too early like we did. The action and the vibes kick in only past midnight, with the banging Hiphop  RB tunes.

Not exactly the cheapest, but if you can get access to a private table, you'll be extremely well taken care of the entire night.

Thank you, team, for making sure that our bachelor night party crew enjoyed themselves thoroughly. Went with my wife and was charged a total of 700 baht which includes two drinks..got my drink and stood at one of the tables near the bar which was free.. loved the music and the vibe.. great place to party.. guess they have two levels..was not bothered about buying a drink.. the only small error was that they got my mixer wrong and gave me coke instead of soda.. loved the place and will come back.. Ladies have to pay 300 Baht with 1 drink of your choice. 500 Baht for the men.

It was great. But party dont start till like 1130 and I went on a Saturday Night. I dont know because I came 1130 and the place was not even half full. The music on this Saturday Night is a soso, when it had to be banging!!! But it wasnt. It was just trying to be chill music and super loud.

Never had food here so I cannot comment on that.

They didnt even play Rihanna songs as much, Starships, EDM remix or anything very lively. It was like going up and down music all the time and it bored me. But it was packed anyway.

They need to change the DJ I think, the place is good. The DJ seems to be playing songs he likes, not what the crowd would like.  Because remember, your customers are mostly coming from Western countries, so it should be solid music.  Good club for those who like hip hop music. Prices are ok and the atmosphere is great.

The Club,"123 Thanon Khao San, Taladyod Pranakorn Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand",4.5,13.7592373,100.4968377,"Would give a 5 star if the entry was free, although entry came with a free drink and the price was decent, its more expensive than other options so money adds up in small quantities for entry.

This club was great, lots of people, great atmosphere, anything you want to find youll find. There was great music vibes and service. No drama or disturbances, friendly people both local and tourists.

Recommend highly if your in Bangkok especially in khaosan area this place is a crazy packed street full off loud music and everything one could expect for an intense but enjoyable night out.

Also recommended at the end of the street almost opposite the club is a club called Rocco club think thats the name its a beautiful 67 story bar, restaurant and club with stunning views of the chaotic pastry street and Bangkok city then after another small entry fee an almost hidden sound proof club that one would barely notice is so intense from the outside! Went there on a Tuesday night 1020pm, so the crowd wasn't as crazy. It was slightly empty until more people started coming in after an hour.

We spent a few hours in the club, entrance was free, and the DJs they had was decent. It's nice that they played music and songs that we know so we can sing along, whether it's English or Spanish songs. The music genre was EDM which I personally like. Our group of 4 ordered a tequila bottle and juice to go with it that was enough for us with me getting slightly drunk. However although I'd give the music a solid 7.5810, the energy of the DJ is about 510.

The toilet is clean and big enough. The staff did a great job explaining the menu and drinks to us as well! The lighting is decent, the speakers were decent too but it would be great if it had a bit more bass. There's a nice spot near the DJ for you to get onto and dance, or you could just dance at the regular floor if you want! Securitybouncer might be lacking a bit, but maybe that's because it's a weekday.

Would come again with friends  Honestly, I don't know if I'll return again. Khao San Road is such an oxymoron that anything along the same road gives off the same emotions. This is probably a little more filtered in energy, vs anything you find outside along the main road.

We arrived around 3.15am, got a table like we were bosses, and the energy was definitely riding upwards. Ambience, lighting, music, vibes, everything was on point.

Until you actually scan your surroundings, absorb everything, get your drinks served, realise that it's such a diverse crowd, see that there's a change of DJ, and everything starts to crumble at 4am clubclose, lights on.

The Club unfortunately doesn't give off the ""it's safe to lose yourself and just party"" feeling at any one moment. It's not just about the number of security guards standing around, or whether you have a table...

As much as it was an enjoyable evening, for someone who would rather pay for personal safety and enjoyable vibes, I'm sure there are better spots elsewhere around Bangkok. You should pay 250 Thb as entry which is included one free alcoholic drink.
Also the music is the best in khaosan road I went to the club. They are charging 250 bhat per person and you'll get one beer or mixer. The atmosphere is OK, the DJ keeps repeating the song and most of the crowd leaves the place.

The club owner came to me and asking for my phone. When I showed him, he took my phone and trying to give fake reviews. I caught him and then he started abusing me. This is my genuine review and I wrote what I observed there. The club owner went to those people who are too high. He takes their phone and gave fake google reviews.

Instead of going to this club, I recommend going to ""the one at khaosan"" and ""lucky beer"". The vibes are amazing and also you're gonna enjoy the music there.","Monday: 9:00 PM – 4:00 AM

Live music, good drink, nice staffs and very nice ambience. Even the bartenders will entertain you even if they are busy making drinks.

They have pizza, popcorn and garlic bread in their menu.

If you go there more than once they will remember you and welcome you.

Usually music starts at 9.30 pm everyday except Monday and lasts till 1.00 pm. You will find popular contemporary and old pop, rock and hiphop songs are played there. Their DJ is also very enjoyable to listen.

If you want a little privacy, there is a first floor.

They have strict security. Don't get fooled by their checking at the entrance, that is for your own safety.

Highly recommended. One of the best live music club on Soi11.
Staffs are very friendly wa well as musicians make very good sound..

httpsyoutu.beipvgtTwbY?si2PhYx5JsxCdjkjjY Juicy Bangkok Sukhumvit 11 is a vibrant spot located in the heart of Bangkok. Known for its oldschool live music, it features the best of Pop, Hip Hop, and RnB from the 90s to early 2000s. The atmosphere is immersive, with a boombox DJ booth, arcade games, graffiti, neon signs, and an outdoor patio. Its a great place to dance, sing along, and enjoy some food from their Popcorn or Pizza bar.  Really cool bar with live band performing. Clean, funky and swanky! Service is excellent.

Entry was fast and no queue maybe due to weekday lesser crowd . Buy an entry ticket for 300B and u can exchange it for a drink inside . I was expecting a local Thai music section which they dont really have after asking a few staff there . They have 3 section Kpop  least crowd  EDM  mild crowd  HipHop fully crowded . Was in the EDM side throughout the night until close . Price for drinks is acceptable and the interior of the club and lighting is awesome . Service is alright staff are attentive and drinks are served fast  . The music selection and DJ mixing is still acceptable . But I guess I will not be back again as I do not like any of the 3 theme music there . Today it was very crowded, a lot of people, big clubs, both hip hop.  edm and kpop in the bathroom, there's a live band too, and there's food if you're hungry, me and my mom had a lot of fun today, thank you. It a nice club to enjoy. very crowded on the Friday night.
Would love to recommend one of the nice night club in Bangkok when you visit. Yo, this place was sick! It was 300 Thai baht to get in and you got a free drink anything under 200 baht. It's way more fun if you go with a group! They had different rooms with different music themes.

The dance performances were awesome! The dancers were all hot and the routines were really cool.

The only downside was that the Kpop room was kinda boring and the songs were old. The main hall was also a bit of a let down. I was there for 4 hours and the DJ's music choices were just not it. It was a bit disappointing, especially since it's in Bangkok. If you're looking for a place to party the night away in Bangkok, Route 66 on Rama IX Road might just be the perfect destination for you. As a wellestablished night club that's been around for over 15 years, Route 66 has made a name for itself as a hub for huge parties and a popular destination for university kids and young Thai party goers.

The club boasts three to four dance zones, with a large openair space for partygoers to let loose and have fun. With a cover charge of 300, Route 66 offers a great deal for entry, and buying a bottle and asking for a table upon arrival can save you some money.

One of the main draws of Route 66 is the music. The club features live bands playing Thai pop, hip hop, and house, while three rooms offer different genres of music. Room 1 is dedicated to oldschool rap and hip hop, while Room 2 features a rotation of live bands and singers. The main room, Room 3, is devoted to EDM, house, and electronic music. With such a diverse range of music styles, there's something for everyone at Route 66.

The crowd at Route 66 is primarily young Thais and students, giving the club a vibrant and energetic atmosphere. Whether you're looking to dance the night away or just enjoy some great music with friends, Route 66 has something to offer.

In summary, if you're looking for a fun and exciting night out in Bangkok, Route 66 is definitely worth checking out. With its huge parties, diverse music offerings, and lively crowd, this club is sure to offer a memorable experience.","Monday: 9:00 PM – 4:00 AM

Sing Sing Theater,"45 Soi Sukhumvit 45, Khwaeng Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand",4,13.728252,100.5735013,"Having been deeply immersed in the music and nightlife scene of my own city, Sing Sing Theater in Bangkok offered a refreshing and captivating experience. The ambiance struck me immediately an eclectic blend of gothic elements and mesmerizing lanterns, casting a moody, yet enchanting atmosphere. The attention to detail in the dcor evoked a sense of mystery, setting the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable night.

While the venues design had some structural quirkssuch as precarious stairways and a dimly lit environment that could easily pose a riskthe bouncers did an excellent job at maintaining a safe and smooth experience to the patrons.

The sound design was superb, filling the space with a pulsating rhythm that complemented the crowd, which was a wellbalanced mix of locals and tourists. The DJ kept the energy high, skillfully blending tracks to keep the crowd moving until the early hours. I was a bit annoyed with the excessive use of ice for drinks, resulting in overly chilled drinks that somewhat muted the flavor. Yet, they were still enjoyable.

Sing Sings true charm lies in its theatrical flair, which sets it apart from other clubs. The live performancesa samurai and a woman gracefully swinging from the ceilingadded a playful, surreal element to the night, enhancing the clubs theme and making it a more immersive experience.

One drawback, however, is the pricing of water. I noticed this is common in many Bangkok venues, but charging a premium for something as basic as water feels out of place, especially when many international clubs provide it free of charge.

In sum, Sing Sing Theater offers a unique, theatrical twist on the usual clubbing experience, with topnotch music, a vibrant crowd, and an ambiance thats both edgy and enthralling. It's a mustvisit for anyone seeking a latenight adventure, running until 4 AMa rare gem in Bangkoks nightlife. This venue offers an electrifying atmosphere with its dark, industrial design and vibrant red lighting that sets the perfect mood for a night out. The DJ booth, elevated and surrounded by unique decor, allows the beats to fill the space, creating an immersive musical experience. The setup is professional and the sound system is topnotch, making it ideal for those who love to dance the night away. Highly recommend for anyone seeking an unforgettable nightlife experience! On Thursday Girls night there were 20 girls and 80 guys, but overall the spot was completely dead and empty. Enjoyed the free drinks of my girlfriend though. So, thanks. Sing Sing Theater in Bangkok offers a unique nightlife experience with its dramatic, oriental Chinese mafiainspired decor.
this club features intricate wrought iron designs, hundreds of red lanterns, and plenty of dragon imagery. The space is divided into multiple levels, with two downstairs bars, a central dance floor that doubles as a stage, and a balcony overlooking the scene. The vibe is both stylish and theatrical, complete with silkcovered walls and a humansized bird cage

The club is known for its immersive themed parties, hosts a variety of performances, including burlesque.
The music selection is eclectic, covering house, jazz, and hiphop, ensuring there's something for everyone

Cocktails are reasonably priced, featuring premium liquors and creative signature drinks.

highly recommend it for its unique ambiance and lively entertainment. Loved everything about this place. Easy entry to getting drinks at the bar, the club is built nicely and has different levels that suit your mood. You can stand by the bar or order drinks at your table. You can always go a level up and groove on the tunes played by the DJ.

I went on a Thursday and a Saturday  liked it more on Thursday tbh. Good mix of locals and expats. Highly recommended.

Drinks are on the pricier side so come prepared!","Monday: Closed

There is a burger king next to it. You will receive a body check upon entering. You can check your luggage for at least 20 baht. Make sure to bring your ID with a photo of your face. It is also possible with a photo. The entrance fee is 300 baht for two drinks. 400 baht on weekends Credit cards can be used for payments of 2 thousand baht or more. I usually enjoy watching shows until around 24 o'clock. After 24 o'clock, many people dance on stage until 3 o'clock. The customer base is mostly young and foreign. It's a fun place, but there's always the same person and the same music is repeated, so if you go there a few times, you'll get bored.
Please enjoy your trip when you come. Went for a few beers to check out the gay nightlife.  Definitely crowded with locals and tourists primarily in their 20s and 30s.  Drags shows also were taking place around 1100 pm. Been my safe place and LGBTQIA Community ever since. Security has done its duty professionally, with Bartenders giving nice drinks and the prices affordable.

I love being here with my friends. I enjoyed watching The DJ station shows especially Tuay's The Divas, I've been her fan ever since my legal age allowed me to be here

The atmosphere is what I couldn't see the management with Cigarettes, I am not a fan of Cigarettes, and the cigarette environment AT ALL, I usually ruined my  joy, my Perfume, and my Dry Clean Only outfits always spend some good time here with friends! But the alley can get very crowded so beware especially during peak season like songkran or new year.

entrance fee is 300 THB and get 2 drinks. Really love the crowd and how each club as their own music and clientele. Love the KPOP club energy, love the drag club, love the quieter karaoke club as well, and the chill laidback second floor for meetup with friends so you can talk.

always had great time here! It was a fun Thursday night.  We got there around 10pm and paid 300b which includes 2 drinks.  It was quite quiet at that time.  By midnight admission is 500b and the place is mostly packed on the ground floor.  Shows are good and we had a blast!","Monday: 8:00 PM – 3:00 AM

I would have liked it more if the outdoor space was bigger with seats outside, leaving more space for the people to enjoy the view, which is breathtaking. Overall, the place is nice if you want to enjoy a cocktail in a fancy place this is perfect. I'm Thai and this is the first time I hit this club after hearing about it for quite a while. The club is at Sathorn. You can travel by BTS and drop out at Chong Non Si station but note that the last BTS is at midnight. The club opens until 3 am which is an hour further to the others.

It is an elegant one. Dress well. Most of peeps are expats. Rarely find Thais.

Songs are mainstream pop with beats.

A general drink would cost around Baht 300500. Good high end club,  great views.  Crowd mid twenties to late 30s.

Entrance ticket is 500 bath per person including 1 drink so its very reasonable. There are 2 floors, 1 hip hop  the other one is techno which is cool! Cool Location. Went there to see a live act and it was a good time. However the drink prices are very high and to get remotely drunk you might want to come with a full wallet. Paid 650 for a bucket that was 80 ice cubes and not very strong. Other drinks glass are around 280350 THB also not very strong. Beer is around 250 THB. Management should really reevaluate the prices or mix of their drinks to boost the amount of people that visit. It would help both the customers and the owners. Had a good night but I will not visit again. Architecture here was nice. Good sound system and lighting.

Pub here has too many rules, need to wear just only some kind of shoe, no camera allow etc. The rule was just pop up when you arrived.

Good thing is they have locker and bag deposit counter for you.

Not so many people, and people here are quite act cool, stylish, old and individualism.

Getting high here will make you more entertainment cuz the music is quite boring depends on day, but many day 31 Dec 18 and today 28 Aug 19 are good.

Last time i was here, i almost slept even the volume is super loud but cannot, you need to open a bottle of liquor to able to reach the sofa area.

Some wellknown DJ open the music same as their playlist on Spotify.

Booze is standard. Nothing special. Beautiful spot. The club music was great and good drinks. You can sit outside and chill or go inside and party. Enjoyed my time there. Cool aesthetics.

Highly recommended place to go for those who know what real techno is Id like to give big compliments for Dois service. He is a dedicated employee. He took our order with great attention to detail and ensured we had everything we needed. He made sure our drinks were ready for us in no time. I wasn't entirely satisfied with the other staff member, but Dois performance made up for it and made my evening memorable. Ill come back for him. What an impressive guy! The music here was really good, the DJs were very engaging and the crowd was really chill. Drinks were slightly on the pricier side for what they were serving. I've consistently had the best nights here in all of Bangkok. It's a place for music lovers  not a pick up bar, although you can definitely still get lucky. But let me talk music for a moment. The techno here is sublime. The DJ's really know how to get the crowd moving and I've danced from getting through the door to closing time on many occasions. If you love good music, a great bar, and lots of cool people  this place is for you. Incredibly weak club and atmosphere. Djs are absolutely amateurs, overpriced drinks, aggressive staff and an owner who could care less about the security as many flights and assaults are provoked by them.

For the young, those who likes to dance.
I practically danced whole night.
Stage and atmosphere is always high, and music brings you in with linked rhythm and beats.
Rarely plays sad or slow song.
For those looking for companion, try the bar area near the entrance beside restrooms. Often saw single standing ladies, you can pay for their services.

No food, only drinks. Still considered expensive in Bangkok, 1 bottle with 5 entrance fee covered, cost you about 4300 baht.
Per pax entrance fee is 400 baht.
Waitresses are friendly and helps you mingle to make friends.
You just need to occasionally tip them for their help. Some of the most fun nights were here in Bangkok, especially if you like hardstyle, trance, or peak techno music on certain days.

We really enjoyed the music.

Bottle service was cheap! So it was good to snatch a table and get a bottle here to spend the night.

Also went here for halloween! had such a great time. Onyx has a terrific dance vibe and my friends and I enjoyed the place for a few hours. There are many staff members and they are super friendly and very attentive to make sure you have a great time! We really enjoyed this night club! Love the ambience and service but there isnt stage for public dancing, everywhere is full of table which looks very congested  Worst club, pricing, securities attitude I have seen in a while. Weird restrictions about who allowed to dance on their stage, the security stepped me down when I attempted to step on the stage in front of dj booth even I paid f 400 baht to enter this joke place. It was only one old dude dancing on the stage, probably from vip table or something, it looked so poor and miserable for such spacious room.

Have a drink on your own, watch beautiful nude ladies and leave. Don't buy them a drink, there's no service for you no satisfaction or anything. Would not recommend this place. First time i went I almost got kicked out for using. Translator to speak with a girl  screaming at me NO PICTURES. How do I communicate then?  Second time a couple came and sat in half my seat not allowing me to reseat my two girls who had just gone to the toilet  this after I had already spend hundreds of USD and even bought drinks for the mamasan  amd they sat back and allowed these thai nationals to speak grossly to me and I spoke back!.  Never again, avoid this place. I have to be very honest about my review on this place. Everything and every negative comment on this place is true. Please dont go. They take advantage of you and overcharge! Its not safe! Go at your own risk. The worst place Ive ever been to. The workers There  mamasan always roaming asking for your money or tips, girls all time talking about money, they dont care about customers happines, bussines is not like that. On Pattaya u can found better clubs like this much better in all ways, like Willdmimd. unfriendly and racist staff, entrance is always been free, but some people when they try to enter they ask for 500 it depend on your skin color and race.","Monday: 7:00 PM – 2:00 AM

While the exterior is already stunning with its traditional architecture, the inside is a true treasure trove. The museum houses a remarkable collection of beautiful, valuable, and historic artifactsfrom ancient sculptures to intricate carvings and textilesthat vividly tell Thailand's rich story.

The exhibits are thoughtfully curated, and the staff are both knowledgeable and friendly, making the experience even more enjoyable. If you love culture, art, or history, the Thai National Museum is an absolute mustvisit! Very good place to spend a meaningful time during a hot sunny day with parents who prefer indoor. They have different hall to show a specific topics.

Nice setting to present thai history and sufficient space to showcase their tools and heritage. Especially enough for thai's most important area of kingdom and Buddhist.

Ticket price is 200 thb for adults only, absolutely nothing for so much contents. Took my small family here in which we first took the sky train from the city. After the we got off the stop it was way too hot to walk so we just hopped onto the taxi. Friendly guards to lead you to the ticket booth. Saw a lot of cool things about Thai culture and Bangkok. Remember to leave your water bottle outside. Most of the indoor exhibits were clean and air conditioned! The coffee shop was nice and cool as well for a quick break. Great for the family! It's really worth to visit this place. There are three free guided tour available which is English, Japanese and French guided tour. We were very happy to join the English guided tour which explain quite detail about the history of Thailand and the muzium. We reached here quite early so no crowd to buy entrance tickets. Good place for history lovers. Gives out a lot of information about Thai Culture, people and history. Very well maintained, Air conditioned. Takes approximately 2 hrs for detailed tour. Shows the connection between India, Hinduism and Buddhism, where everything was began from India.","Monday: Closed

Museum Siam,"4 Thanon Sanam Chai, Khwaeng Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand",4.5,13.744147,100.494137,"The museum, focused on Thai history and culture, turned out to be more interesting than I expected. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an interest in these subjects. Theres an audio guide available in English, German, French, and other languages. The museum isnt overwhelmingly large, so it can be explored in a relatively short amount of time.

Pros
Audio guided
Not so challenging to clear
It does what you expect of a museum

Cons
Not that I can think of The museum was full of interactive activites from treasure hunt to history show and role play activity. My kid absolutely loved playing card games to know more about Thai culture. The traditional food room was fun, too. Strongly recommend to families with kids. The museum was simply amazing! Almost everything was interactive, just don't forget to walk around with audio guide. From food culture to children's games and school life, you learn everything about their past and even current identity struggles. I would recommend sparing 12 hours for the museum and have fun while learning. The ticket is quite affordable in my opinion and was money well spent. The museum is conveniently located a few minutes' walk away from the pier. The building itself is very beautiful and if you have time after all the exhibits, enjoy some drinks or snacks from the food trucks  mini cafes in the museum garden.

The exhibits were very interesting and wellmaintained and the audio guide was great! I liked how interactive everything was. Definitely a must visit if you're in Bangkok. The entire museum can be explored within 1.5 to 2 hours on average. It wasn't crowded when we visited in the morning, even though it was a Saturday, so you don't have to buy tickets online and can just purchase them in person.

Last, I'd like to give a shout out to the friendly and helpful museum staff receptionists, exhibit caretakers, janitors, etc. as well! Good for tourist or small group travelers who wish to understand Thai culture.  The museum is a 3storey colonialstyle building, displaying works related to culture, beliefs and the warm charm of Thainess, with a touch of humor. Take the elevator to start viewing on the 3rd floor and continue down to the 1st floor.

At the back there is a wide lawn and a health food restaurant and a cute cafe. Sit and admire the beautiful garden and vintage buildings. I've been there twice and still like it.","Monday: Closed

Bangkokian Museum,"273 Soi Saphan Yao, Khwaeng Si Phraya, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand",4.6,13.7281433,100.5182074,"Beautiful museum in Bang Rak. Its a bit misleading as it should be called Bangrak Museum because it covers mainly the history and development of this particular area.

The house is owned by the family whose ancestors lived here but they opened it for the public. It captures the life of a well educated upper class Thai family in the middle of the 20th century. You can visit three houses the  we house the family lived in, the clinic the first husband of Indian descent was working in and a third house that serves as a Bangrak History museum.

Entrance is free and the volunteers working here are super nice, helpful and lovely. You may wanna spend 4560min here. Nice, free tour of three homes, including one Indian Doctor who also hosted Rabindra Nath Tagore,a prominent public figure  and Nobel Laureate in literature.
The attendentsguides were super nice and explained in details.
The houses were is good conditions with nostalgic touch. The weight machine, locks,working light switches, and gas light were awesome. I stumbled upon The Bangkokian Museum after getting lost in the city, and it turned out to be a fortunate discovery. The volunteers at the museum were incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. Some of them spoke English fluently and were eager to answer any questions about the history within the home. It was a truly enriching experience, and I am grateful to have visited. Highly recommend this gem of a museum! If you enjoy history in the sense of how people lived early 20th century in Bangkok, then this venue might resonate with you... Also the very caring staff concerned that I was overheating because the ac was switched off and the day 26Sep20242567 happened to be particularly humid... 3 different spaces to view, the first a formal house dedicated to modern living of the time, the second a pavilion dedicated to the good doctor's medical practice, and the last, more contemporary building with Aircon showing the development of Bangkok from the early 20th century onward as it began to grow and develop into the city we know today.

No entrance fees.
Signin and photo and phone number required with plenty of smiles this museum is slightly of the beaten track and with a slow pace offers another view of Thailand that isn't as immediately obvious to tourists.

Note  several stairs, slippery wooden surface and no formal mobility access points might not make this every person's cuppa.

Happy to have seen and learn!
Smiles and two thumbs up! There are altogether 3 houses here.  One of them was transferred from another location, originally belonged to a doctor related to the family. The facility is managed by government after the owner donated the property and maintained as museum. Nice little museum to have a flash back of early life during the 1940s to 50s. Remind me of my grandparents modest timber house in some detailing.","Monday: Closed

It has so many things on offer for the little ones. The standouts for us were the 4D movie the pure joy from the kids when the bubbles popped out made my mouth hurt from smiling, the water park and the careers area for under 6s my kid loved this and we had to wait for almost an hour til we had to call it quits.

Really grateful that even as foreigners we can access it for free. Id be more than happy to pay a donation to contribute to its upkeep and resourcing. I think every city should have a science museum.

Thanks so much I came here with my 3yearold. It was not too crowded. The outdoor area seemed fun bit it was too hot, so we chose to stay in the airconditioned area. There were many interactive activities. However, we could not get in the lego play area because the slots were limited. Also, all of the activites were in Thai language with English subtitles only, so it was a bit hard to understand for foreign kids. A free place for kids . foreigners just need to show passport. they will provide a wrist band,it just used for entering the front gate.4D cinema is very good for kids.although the movie is in Thai.but so easy to understand via the animation. there are some more measurements for kids. check out my pictures. The entry is free, but many of the exhibits or galleries are broken and not working. Some areas also lack air conditioning. Make sure to bring your ID for entry. Its conveniently located near Chatuchak Weekend Market, so you can easily visit the market, park, and this place all in one trip with your family. Spent 3 hours here before went to Chatuchak. So my plan works. Let the kid be tired and you can shop freely after that. I think we went to 3 rooms in here. My kid is below 2 years old so not all rooms will allow her to go in. Overall, she enjoyed so much here. Thanks Bangkok!!!
Oh ya I forgot. Parents need to take turns going in the room. Only one parent allowed.","Monday: Closed

It will be interesting to see what they do with this space. The old mint and its courtyard offer a great venue to appreciate Bangkoks 19th century, Europeaninspired architecture and the art therein. Until then, not really worth the 200 baht admission if this is itthough the charge seems to be waived some days. So stop in if you happen to be in the area, but dont go out of your way. Btw, pics allowed with no flash The National Gallery of Bangkok  Located on Chao Fa Road in Bangkoks historic Phra Nakhon District and is housed in the building of the former Royal Thai Mint. You will see unknown and renowned Thai artworks here, both old and new.

Great place for a rainy day, thats not a shopping mall   Give yourself at least 1 hour here.

Ticket cost 200 baht 6 USD Open Wednesday  Sunday, 9am  4pm

Directly across the street is The National Museum.
Easy and convenient to see both in the same day also 200baht ticket. plenty of the most beautiful Thai art works from the past to the present. The exhibition is very interesting. Large and cozy, plenty of arts display
30 thb for the ticket The National Gallery is a short walk around the corner from several other parks and museums. For only 30 Baht, visitors get access to main spaces that are open as well as the sculpture garden. Visitors should not pay anymore than 30 Baht either in advance or online. They do a lot of repairs and recirculating, so everything is not always open... With that said, we had a chance to see local artists and a Thai professor's exhibition. There is a timeline of past artists influenced by Western culture as well as a welcome from King Rama IX. Overall it's worth an hour and a half of your time. Families will love the expanse, shade and air conditioned exhibits and picnic area at the National Gallery.","Monday: Closed

I come on weekdays and spend around one hour inside the art gallery . I purchased a few handmade items which are tote bags and postcards. I'm happy to be able to contribute a little bit for the students. I had no idea that this place was completely free to go into and they run various exhibitions 100 worth a visit. You can access it via the BTS line. A lot more contemporary style art with a very Thai crowd not many tourist actually only ones that wander in occasionally. Multiple different types of exhibitions and shops as well as coffee and a really nice restaurant taste wise! The general exhibition is closed at the moment and will reopen on the 24 of October 2024

An amazing building with artsy shops and cafes as well as the art centre library in the souterrain and a small theatre on one of the upper floors.

When I went there, there was the geographical indications exhibition in cooperation with the European Union on display in the atrium.

Vee was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout my visit. He not only guided me through the gallery but also went the extra mile by sharing contacts easily in order to stay in touch.

Moreover, I was pleasantly surprised when Vee showed me around the entire gallery. Their passion for art was evident, and it made my visit all the more enjoyable. Art Gallery 36 in Bangkok is not just a place to appreciate art it's a place where you can forge connections, explore diverse artistic expressions, and have a truly memorable experience. I can't recommend it enough! Good pricing and great collection. Store owner is very friendly. Cool art gallery with lots of oil paintings. Pretty big selection in a small space, so its good if you dont have too much time. Great art, be sure to see the upstairs as that is where they keep the good stuff I visited the gallery today and should confess it's a such a good place to have a look at, if you're thinking to buy a painting in Thai or Lao styles and not only. Among dozens of paintings you might find even the Vincent van Gogh's Starry night! Seriously. Special thanks to Vee and Am for being hospitable!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Films, sculptures, paintings and interactive works of art are displayed over three floors. I really liked the mix. It would be great if more bilingual explanatory panels were used. The loftlike building is fantastic as it draws the focus to the exhibits.

And we all love a free entry  The building itself is very well reconstructed, the space is very modern and airy.
I saw beautiful exhibitions on each floor, all of them very stimulating and thoughtprovoking. It was wonderful to see how young Thai artists see and think about their country and how they are able to portray it. I loved the visit! Thank you  Extremely memorable. Had an unexpected amazing time here. This was one of my favorite places. I won't spoil it but it was beautiful. Very interesting art center.
Many great surprises waiting the visitors.
Three floors of great art, culture, work shop, exhibitions, history lessons and fun.
It's free entry for everyone and no limit time to spend inside.
It's in a unique location where you once you finished, you can walk to another two art museums next door and the Golden Temple near by.
Undoubtedly, it's a fantastic art center you must visit if you are in Bangkok. Part Museum and Part Art Gallery it's free to visit and makes for a great double event with the nearby Rattanakosin Exhibition Hall.
Two floors, the 2nd Floor is all about ASEAN, the collaboration of  10 SE Asian Countries. Its great and quite good fun as you have many interactive displays where you can compare the similarities as well as differences between each country. For example, see yourself dressed in the National Costumes of each country. See popular dishes prepared by a Cartoon Type chef etc.
The other part of the building on the 1st floor is a display of modern art, paintings and video, as well as photographic themes like martial arts, national festivals and National Dresses. Easily spend an hour here so three hours if you combine with Rattanakosin.","Monday: Closed

If I'm free, I'll definitely drop by to have a quick look. The overall experience unfortunately depends on who they're presenting at that point in time, and what's being hung on the walls. They don't squeeze too much of their artists' works in the space, and makes it just nice for an enjoyable experience. After you're done, sit by Hearth Art Cafe, for a quick coffee, before you go. Interesting fusion between an art gallery and a coffee place. The interior style is very cool and the music and art combine into an ambiance that is different in a good way from the million other coffee places in Bangkok. Recommended to check this out! Such a nice gallery and cafe in a classic wood house locating right in the middle of the city. Not so far from BTS Surasak. Recommend if you want to check out some arts or stop by for a fancy drink with such a good gallery vibe. Lovely art gallery  cafe hidden in an alley.
Came for the art, stayed for the drinks.
Free entry and cats are friendly too Great little caf and gallery!  If you want to drink nice coffees surrounded by good art, that's possible.  If you want to go and see serious work in the changing exhibitions, that's also possible!

Presentation is excellent.  Lovely place for a date.  But it's also a hardcore art space, they show some of the top local painters.

Do take note of the precise location enter from Soi 23 via the little outdoormall area or directly the alley connecting to Surasak Road is private and usually closed.","Monday: Closed

The place is also riverside, you can take the boat to cross the river and go to Icon Siam Tang Gallery Bangkok is located on the 2nd level of River City.

Interesting concept as the gallery represents mostly Chinese Artist and some Thai  Asian Contemporary artist as well. The exhibitions rotates from the to time. Its worth the visit if the artist that you like is currently on display. Located in River City Bangkok, the space is large and airy but there is no staff there to guide or introduce anything I really like the works in the contemporary art exhibition","Monday: Closed

A little small but super fun nonetheless since the current exhibit includes a 12min VR experience  for free too! The vibes are immaculate and the librarybookstore right beside it was an aesthetic place for photos. The staff was also super friendly so that really tied things together for us. Would recommend 1010! Such a cool space, and it also got a library with a great selection of books about art, music, tech ... Small art gallery in Bangkok. Free entrance.

Walkable distance from MRT Lumpini. Location is in the peaceful and quiet area.
There're 2 rooms separately. The library is on the left side while the exhibition is on the right side.

I got good vibes from this place. It's nice to spend my afternoon at such a good place like this. Beautiful small gallery with dedicated staff. I spent some time in the adjacent building looking at a great selection of self published books that often complimented prior exhibitions. The staff were friendly and engaging and I learnt a lot. Theres a beautiful shaded table under a tree that adds to the whole experience. Id be back often if I lived in Bangkok. Very cool space for those who are keen in arts.","Monday: Closed

But when I went there, the shown exhibition lacked artistic demands as well as curatorial standards.

In my opinion, the ""art"" on display had a purely decorative function and hardly any deeper meaning. The theme was transience, but it was treated in a superficial and clichd manner.

In the entire threestory exhibition there were maybe 5 works that were somewhat interesting. A lot of it was really horrible kitsch. However, the purpose of the institution seems to be primarily to sell the works and not primarily to provide cultural education. I hope other exhibitions on site are more sophisticated. One of the very attractive sites for art exhibition lovers. Entrance fee 50 Bth. All staff are very friendly and warmly welcoming as well as helpful. No other tourist people in the gallery, while we enjoyed spending our time together. So impressive! A small gallery in the city center, where now, in September 2024, an exhibition of religious works is taking place. There are many very original paintings, it is worth visiting. But on the second floor it is unbearably hot although the other floors have air conditioning, much hotter than outside, you will have difficulty looking at the paintings because you feel unwell. Nice art gallery, worth to visit it. The entrance fee is 50 baht. 3 floors of art gallery to visit.

I first visited the gallery since I was in town because of work, but only decided to buy a specific painting when I was back in Europe. I must say that Art to Art team provided an extremely professional service offering to pick me up at the hotel to take me to the Gallery when I first contacted them. Later on transaction happened in the most smooth way, and finally logistics worked perfectly, the painting was perfectly packed in a rigid protecting tube that enable its delivery in Europe in perfect state. I was constantly updated on each of the phases of the process. I strongly recommend doing business with Art to Art Gallery. Diego We couldn't be happier with our experience with Art to Art Gallery. We live in the United States and had been looking for a painting by a particular artist since 2014. The gallery found the painting for us luckily they had one of the few that exist in their gallery and worked with us to ensure that the painting was perfectly packaged and safely delivered. I was concerned about purchasing art sight unseen, but the gallery answered all of my questions and concerns and were professional through the entire process. I highly recommend purchasing art from this gallery. Whenever we are in Bangkok we pay a visit to arttoart gallery. They have a very good selection of works of modern Asian artists. We usually find pieces to buy. We also found the shipping and processing of the purchases very reliable and professional. We always enjoy to be there. This is not a gallery!  This is a small room!

Child friendly and very cheerful barista. Not crowded on a a weekday morning. Very chill setting with great aircon.

The exhibition I visit is ""Fluffy Fluffy Galaxy"" by Miguel Delie. The staff there is freindly and very helpful. On 4th floor, there is a large clear view of Odien roundabout.

Remark
 They don't have elevator, only stair ...
 The toilet is on the top floor Over the influence is a sanctuary of contemporary art hidden in Bangkoks China town.

I had the pleasure of catching Superfuturekids solo exhibition, a playful dive into fantasy and colours. What a fabulous art gallery in the middle of Chinatown. They change Their exhibition every few weeks. I was lucky to catch Algerian artist Samets exhibition. The third floor has a spectacular view of Odeon Circle, the historic circle in the middle of Yaowarat. The view of the Temple of the Golden Buddha, Wat Traimit, is also serene and inspiring.

At 100 Tonson Foundation ,Bangkok ,Thailand

Field Collapse is a gallerybased environment inspired by construction sites, where the details of a workinprogress communicate social, economic, and aesthetic messages that often go unread. 100 Tonson Gallery earns it reputations for being the finest and one of the first Contemporary Gallery in Bangkok. The gallery is located on tonson street. The same street as the Embassy of The Netherlands.

Despite the narrow street and I have to agreed with other comments on here saying the the cars passing by are quite dangerous as the footpath are very narrow and trees are everywhere. Be very cautious on commuting via foot.

The place deserve 5 stars from me despite the not very convenient walking on footpath, due to the arts works selected there. Sometimes there are live performances as well. Artworks exhibited are rotates around every 2 months. Owner and staff are super friendly and kind. Great exhibition space!  Interesting contemporary artist choice.  Thoughtful installations.  Let artist experiment and express.  Porch on the outside, warmth inside I love the exhibition","Monday: Closed

Wonderful place overall. Im based in Bangkok. I usually visit this park quite often about once a week.  Its a huge area split into two different parks. The older park which is near Queen SiriKit has a beautiful lake in the middle, but its not shaded. The swamp park on the other side is great to walk or run around and has an amphitheatre and
skywalks If you are traveling to Bangkok, I highly recommend spending a couple hours walking through Benchakitti park, especially the Skywalk! Plenty of drinking fountains and public restrooms. Wellmaintained.","Monday: 4:30 AM – 9:00 PM

It was a lovely peacefull respite from the heat as the trees have created a microclimate and provided shade. Some really cool plants I have never seen before and lots of cute squirrels running around. It's a huge park near Chatucak market. Made in honour of Queen Sirikit, the lake in the middle is in the shape of her name in Thai script. The Curcumas are in season now and they carpet the park in shades of pinks. It's a very beautiful park with unique native plants brought in from all over Thailand. The Golden Leaf Bauhinia is in bloom too and the gorgeous young leaves are in shimmering bronze. When the leaves mature, the bronze hairs on the young leaves drop off and they become green. So fascinating. We learned this through a botanical art workshop conducted by SciArt network, Mahidol university and Botanical Art Society of Singapore. The professor in the course studies native banana species and brought us to see a big section where all the different bananas are brought together as a showcase.
Many people use it for exercise throughout the day as the grounds are very scenic with the plantings, multiple bridges and the interesting curvy lake. It's such a peaceful place, perfect for escaping the hustle and bustle of the city. The park is filled with beautiful trees that provide plenty of shade on sunny days. There are several ponds and fountains that add to the serene atmosphere, and it's so relaxing to just sit and listen to the water.

I was delighted to see a variety of birds and even spotted some fish and monitor lizards in the ponds. The park is quite large, so there's a lot of space to walk around or find a quiet spot to relax. A beautiful walk through nature! This park is located near BTS Sam Yot, but we had to walk through Chatuchak Park to get to this entrance.

The park is beautifully curated and absolutely huge. There are different areas with different aesthetics. There are also different paths to walk on, there is the main path and also smaller paths along the water, and some smaller specialty gardens. The flowers are beautiful, and the water is calming. The lotus pond area is also tranquil and quiet.

It was a little difficult to find the toilet, but thankfully there were guards around I could ask for directions.

If you are a fan of the Thai GMMTV lakhon 23.5, this is where the swing shots are filmed. Have a fun mission looking for the spot! We crossed the waters like 810 times looking for the filming location which has changed a little because the trees have been trimmed.

Over all, a really beautiful place to spend a day. If you plan on staying long, I suggest you locate a toilet before walking around. At least you will know where it is, unlike me  A beautiful and clean park to walk, do exercise, relax and rest. Cycling is not allowed there. I do not recommend you to run in the park as the ground is covered with paving stones. It is connected with the Rot Fai Park through a bridge. You can see both parks if you have time.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 8:00 PM

The park is a beautiful blend of green spaces and innovative infrastructure, making it a perfect spot for relaxation and recreation.

One of the standout features of the park is its windy and refreshing environment. The open layout and thoughtful landscaping allow for a constant breeze, which makes it a pleasant place to spend time, even on warmer days. The parks modern design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional, with wellmaintained pathways, seating areas, and plenty of shaded spots.

Additionally, the park serves as a vital green lung for the city, addressing environmental challenges such as urban heat and water management1. Its a wonderful example of how urban spaces can be transformed into sustainable and enjoyable areas for the community.

Overall, Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park is a mustvisit for anyone looking to enjoy a peaceful and modern outdoor experience in Bangkok. Take a rest on weekends or weekday evenings it's suitable for everyone of all ages and is petfriendly too. There is space for many activities, such as working out, running, playing badminton, or even just talking with friends. Beautiful greenbelt w oxygenated pools, gardens,  trees , exercise and walking areas  great for community  visitors alike. Good light exercise  rebalancing ! I just went here bcs I found BanThad Thong street was a bit overwhelming lol. So I only bought take away to eat in here and it was a good decision especially when you came alone. It was a nice park, not really much to see, but great for chilling even until late of night. Not only university students, I think local and other visitors also come here too. Cute little park on the Chulalongkorn university campus. Very quiet and chill. Its not very big but a nice hangout for university students.

The park is connected to Banthat road. So there is plenty of food and coffee shops around.

Theres also a small open community mall in that park, where students sit and read or chill over coffee.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Perk is pretty clean and wellmaintained. Wonderful park, with nice scenery and a lot of green color.
There is water inside also, so it is not iust grass and trees.

Very convenient to reach, as it is located near the BTS and MRT. So anyone could reach easier.
Chatuchak market is there, so you could add this activity to your list on that day  Beautiful park. Perfect place to spend good time with friends, family. Very clean  well maintained. This was a hidden gem!

After taking a stroll around the area we found this park and ended up spending hours sat by the water.

We saw some reptile like creature and some fish which made it all feel more natural.

You will see a lot of people jogging here and hanging out.

Sadly the toilet was locked by the time we got there so that was the only downside. Lovely, spacious park in the heart of Bangkok. There are plenty of small sections to explore as well as the rest rooms. You can only find water stands near the gates only, so be prepared if you plan to be lost, like me! Lol

The park itself can be intimidating as its very large so be sure to look for signs if you want to explore off the walking path, or else you can easily walk around in circles.","Monday: 4:30 AM – 10:00 PM

Old men are doing tae chi in the main entrance. There is a huge bodhi tree and a pavilion. On the other side is the statue of the Princess sitting on a bench. In the back side there are more beautiful gardens with some ruined buildings. In the center there are offices you can enter for free to read up on the Princess Mother's life story! Great park.

Also provides a lot of places to sit and relax if walking your dog is too tiring.

It is forbidden and there is no fence for it.  There is also no playground for dogs here.  It's ok to walk the dogs there but there is still so much potential to make it better.

Update dogs are required to be on a leash and I think its a good idea  the park borders part of a very long canal than runs through Bangkok parallel to Sukhumwit and links to Lumpini Park too  those Klongs attract water monitor lizards which can get quite big I estimate 2030kg and which can definitely bite and eat a small dog  A pretty nice park for dogs. Theres a pretty waterfall inside, making the vibe more relaxing. I love how theres a tank of water for your dog please bring your own bowl  . HOWEVER, as I was walking, two huge water monitors literally DASHED out of the bush , so please be careful and keep your furry friends in sight. The park itself is nice, but Im quite scared to go back because of those water monitors. My ratings might be a bit on the lower side, largely because of the water monitors, which the park is not to blame. Nice park to walk dog and taking some leisure time. I like the variety of plants species and the way they designed area layout.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Was there for the Jog  Joy Kilo 10k race event.  Outstanding event sponsored by Jog  Joy.  My first race with this running organization, and they did a fantastic job!!!  The race through the park was beautiful.  Park is very clean with many facilities for activities such as bike riding, yoga, jogging, tennis, etc.  I'm looking forward to go back to this park again sometime soon. A nice place to go not far from Seacon Square for a morning walk or an evening stroll. Very pleasant park to go with your family especially those with kids for outdoor fresh air. Kids can bring their bikes and scooters . I am very impressed by the Geodesic Dome there for desert plants. Definitely worth a visit for 10THB as an entry fee per person and it's free after 5 or 6 pm. Amazing park....huge... it has everything u need ...
There is a nice cafe next to the lake...
You can also use the pedal boats ...
Kids playground is available also ...
Cactus and desert  plants area ...
Flowers as well..
Everything is beautiful....gonna post pics and vids Nice Park!
There is an entry fee, but it's like 0,30 ish, so it's not a big deal.
The Park is pretty big with lots of Flowers and Pavillions to go sit down and relax. The most amazing park with tons of running routes and cycling lane.

The park is free to enter after 5PM but you need to pay 10 THB for entering between 9AM5pm

Worth the visit with many beautiful flowers, plants and cute mini garden inside the park.

Furthermore, now the park is connected to Nong bon reservoir so it makes the running route even more fun and longer!

A great place to spend your evening or even half a day in the park.

Beware, it is really hot during the day so I would recommend to come later in the afternoon for more relaxing time.

Park has water stall for purchase and toilet is not free.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Its small but very relaxing!  There is a childrens playground, a basketball court, skate park , and a nice work out facility with many free weights and other work out equipment. There is a construction site right next to it but is seems to not be much of a factor! Still a nice place to relax! A beautiful, although small, park. Nevertheless, there is everything you need for a good rest there is beautiful, wellkept greenery, fountains for decoration and to cool the air , a playground for children, a playing field and an exercise area.
After a walk among the surrounding buildings, it is a nice change of scenery and a moment of rest among nature. I visited a unique park that used to be an old prison. It's an interesting spot with two old towers still standing. There are pretty fountains and a small pond that add to the charm. The park is quite compact and there isn't a lot of greenery, but it's a nice place to see at least once. Worth a quick visit if you're nearby and interested in seeing how an old prison area has been transformed into a public space. Its a nicely maintained park, i came strictly to see old jail buildings, sad most of them have been demolished, but a view watch towers left and a block of cells as well.

I was told by the guard that 7 years ago you could go inside the cells to look, not anymore.

At the park there is also a free public gym, but all equipment seemed very old, rusty, and a bit sketchy..

A small kiosk just at the entrance, selling water and some snacks. Nice park with a gym and sport playground, nearby MRT SamYot.
There are several small restaurant on the south side, outside the park.","Monday: 4:00 AM – 9:00 PM

They are always well cared for, flower plantings and compositions are showy, and even though parks are very popular places among local people, there is always room for having a rest. Saranrom Park is one of those places where a random visitor can sit and cool himherself, eat one's street food meal or just take a nap. A very romantic park within walking distance of MRT Sanam Chai station...  Well manicured and scaped.  Enjoyed by several fitness enthusiasts, a small play area for kids and some sport activities provided as well with a smattering of fitness equipment dotted randomly.  Old trees,  fountains, pavilions and shrines also add to the ambiance.  If parks are your thing this is worthy of a visit, combine with nearby temple and museums. I recently visited a small but very charming park right in the heart of the city's historical area. It's a lovely spot with plenty of wildlife to see, including monitor lizards, treeshrews, and squirrels. However, be aware that there are also quite a few mosquitoes around. I would definitely recommend this park for a quick, naturefilled break from the urban surroundings. Great place to just walk, and view nature and animals. We saw a Monitor Lizard as well. A cute park that is fairly central to some tourist spots.
The park had staff at different entrance.  It was generally pretty clean looking and had some flowers.","Monday: 4:30 AM – 9:00 PM

This place is amazing. So many places for selfies and photos. Beautiful location by day. Amazing lighting by night. Absolute must for any tourist wanting good pics. Not your ""normal park""... Think more along the lines of a late afternoon lovers promenade..  an urban green space that offers the backdrop of plants and sky scrapers against the artificial slopes built over a canal.  Different  yes. Photo opportunities galore. Child friendly? A flat no, unless the adrenaline rush of saving your child from every jagged rock, open water source and unprotected drop is your thing. Did I mention no swings, slides or sandpit either?
Do make an effort for an early morning or sunset shoot..   zero shade and with the heat radiating of every surface.. your glamour would be on the pavement in a puddle of sweat as soon as of you step of Chong Nonsi BTS  the closest stop as well.

Hats, water and umbrellas.. come armed for the weather.. there is no shelter from a sudden downpour either.

Happy photoshooting!! 23 82022 Nice spot for photo shooting especially after sunset. Easy access by public transport both BTS sky train and BRT. Hope this project will extend to another phase and I want to see the result that is this project successful or not. Actually a nice idea to upgrade an otherwise unattractive urban structure. The canal ""park"" connects with Chong Nonsi BTS station, Sathorn BRT station and has a direct entry to Empire Tower. I've spent many lunch breaks here with some food or fruits I got from nearby and it didn't really get that hot because the skyscrapers give enough shade. In the evening the walkways light up and it's very aesthetically pleasing. Hopefully they continue developing the project further. Planting more greens amid the concrete jungle is always a nice sight.","Monday: 4:30 – 9:00 PM

The park is beautiful and well cared for and it's a good place to have small relax in sweaty and all too busy Bangkok, but otherwise, in my opinion, the fort  the park don't have much worth as an attraction. It's an ok park by the fort and the royal pavilion. Flower beds and some trees and one bench seat. There are much better parks in Bangkok....like Pricess Mother Memorial Park!! Enchanting and peaceful little patch of green in the midst of busy temple complexes and canals. Clean and well maintained, could use some more shady trees and benches, though. I was looking for Thai gardening that is here displayed for a tropic climate with bamboo and banana trees. Cutting trees remains a bit on French gardening I stumbled upon Mahakan Fort's park on my way to other attractions, and it turned out to be a nice pit stop to unwind so I kept coming back. It was pretty empty every time and has good views of the surrounding area. The park is filled with lush greenery, but it can get pretty hot during the day since there's not much shade around. The park is wellmaintained and has comfortable benches. You'll also notice a bunch of noisy crows hanging around, but they didn't really bother me.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Not a lot of shade which would be important for the middle of the day Great addition to the area offering an escape from the close by all round hustle and bustle.

Why do you have to construct another park when we have a big park next door ?

Its always good when we have another park in the city but not this one.
This is the sign of corruption.

The good part is they have community fitness which everyone can use for free in the center.

The public drinking water is somehow not clean when I try. Beware. Connects Benjakitti Park to Sukhumvit Rd. Via a 10min walk. Beats walking on the street but odd that you're not allowed to bike on this flat path 
Also, the Sukhumvit entrance is sometimes cordoned off, perhaps to keep street vendors out? Connecting walkway to the main road. Not sure if this is opened 247, but much better than walking by the side of the road for walkers, especially when road is on one side a major roadway, and railtrack, whilst on Benchakitti side, its a road connecting into main road of Ploen Chit.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 10:00 PM

PARK@SIAM,"254 Phaya Thai Rd, Khwaeng Wang Mai, Pathum Wan, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10330, Thailand",4.2,13.7436502,100.5323277,"Super small and quiet park at Siam.
Not a lot of places to walk, but also it is not really crowded, even on the weekend.
Nice trees at the entrance.
Some sitting is available in multiple locations.
Also there is an Amazon Cafe right in the park, so you can get coffee or something for your visit.

Fish in the pond are huge saw some people feeding them
Not sure how to join the water sports though I absolutely adore this petfriendly public park! Its a hidden gem with so much to offer. The pristine lake is perfect for kayaking, and my furry friend loves splashing around the shore. The bike lanes are a fantastic addition, making it easy to explore the park on two wheels.

What sets this place apart are the countless birds that call this park home. Birdwatching here is a delight, and my camera roll is now filled with amazing snapshots of these feathered beauties.

Overall, its a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, and I cant recommend it enough to fellow pet lovers, nature enthusiasts, and anyone looking for a tranquil retreat. This park truly has it all!  Beautiful park having proper walkingrunningcycling track. Centrally located huge lake surrounded by greeneries all throughout, makes the ambience peaceful. Cycle rental shop situated at the entrance. Our first visit here and we loved it! We arrived at about its busiest, so we look forward to visiting again for a workout during less busy mornings. We just had a nice walk. What makes it nice is the shade and break from the sun! My favourite park in Bangkok to take my dog out for a walk! Most dog owners are considerate and follow the rules dogs on leashes, must pick up dog poo and the big lizards are not dangerous, if you keep your distance. I don't recommend letting your dog in the water to swim because dogs have died in the past from contracting Pythiosis there, and small dogs could be snatched by the water monitors. There are also public restrooms available as well as quite a few restaurants and cafes at the park entrance.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 6:30 PM

The walk on the bridge was very relaxing and beautiful.
Definitely one of my fav parks in BKK so far  Great place to take a stroll in the evening. I really enjoyed it. The only thing I didnt like was the mosquitos in the evening time. Aside from that it was great! There are plenty of people who like to take instagram photos here so the walkway is lined with young women posing along the handrails and their boyfriends or whoever, being their photographers but thats not really a bother. Nice park, signage is very bad and has a ton of security which seems weird.

You can only bike in designated bike lanes in specific directions and the majority of the park is walking only.

Very little signage makes this clear. Benjakitti park. Dog friendly, restrooms,parking place and very popular among kids due to sports amenities.. Beautiful skywalk I went to Benjakkiri Park a while back and remembered the place, so I found this place on my way there. Lumpini Park seems to be the most famous in Bangkok, but I actually think Benjakkiri Park and this place are better. This swamplike park seems to have another charm.

Today was their last session for this season and it was absolutely wonderful. Great performances and a beautiful atmosphere.

Parking  yes 30 B  hour , 20 b after first hour This is a nice park in the center of Bangkok, you can meet many fat monitor lizards, ravens, cute cats there. Pretty nice place to chill during the day. My personal favorite is community sport time around 56 p.m.  there are many people any ages doing group work out. Unique Asian experience. Also all bathrooms are free and clean. Definitely not my favorite park in the city because of so much tourists there, however it is a nice place to be fir some time. Very cosy place to reste from the heat and the buzzing streets of Bangkok.But bring a Map and a water bottle, you can spent a lot of time in it without realizing it. A bleesed to visit tough. Thx BKK Royal Bangkok Symphony gives free concerts every Sunday from December through February.

Once the sun sets, the weather is perfect for outdoor concerts. Straw mats are available for rent 40baht and a few beverage stands are on the perimeter of the pavilion.

There is a nice Hainan Chicken and rice place opposite. I accidentally found a treasure playground in Bangkok, and I happened to meet a group of lovely students and played an interesting football match with them. Still need to renovate the ground many hole on the ground. Floor is uneven. Too many garbage at the gate before entering the park. The park is closing down the jogging area for MRT subwayrelated construction work which will last several years. It's a little too small if you are trying to get a good run.

My video captures the entirety of the park.  Don't bother going here. Park looks cool and quiet.

I think it would be perfect for a lite jogging.

It's a bummer that they don't allow any bike here. I brought my 3 year old with a tiny balance bike. By the park's rule, it is a nono.

This park and surrounding area gave me a good view of what I love and enjoy walking through.

Recommend.  Yes!!! The small Graffiti Park with 1 security guard on duty.

Its just '""CooL""..you'll see local having siestas. Nice park with some cool graffiti. Surprisingly calm and an oasis in the middle of the city. There is a football pitch and a few benches to sit on. Nice chilled place near the BTS.  Enough benches and shade.

There are monkey, elephant and some other shows available at specific timing. It will be a good entertaining. Need to pay extra if want to take photo with any animal closer. In summer time it's too hot. The place was really good. Worth the price. We went on a weekend so it was really crowded. People from all over the world were there mostly Indians because they had around 610 tourists groups. I would love to visit again on a weekday and see if its not crowded and maybe I would enjoy more. I would recommend buying tickets in advance because the prices are lower online. The only thing I didnt really like is the prices of the food. You are not allowed to take water and food inside but you can buy it inside the zoo, inside the zoo the prices are too high. I understand that its a tourist spot but either dont raise the prices or let people take food and water themselves. Easily the best place we visited in Bangkok  the kids loved it so much and even the adults. We really enjoyed the safari tour and wide range of animals they have at the Marine Park.

Walking shoes are a must as the park is very big and attractions can be far apart from one another.

Stroller friendly and plenty of places to park strollers when visiting attractions and shows.

For some reason, Google indicated that a Sunday morning is usually not too busy. Had no reason to doubt it since it has never proved us wrong at that time. So we went on a Sunday morning and arrived 30 minutes before the parks opened and there was already a lot of people and tour buses waiting. The park was really REALLY packed.

If you enjoy some quiet and peace, not having to queue for food and toilet, I strongly recommend against going on a weekend. Our driver said that weekends are the busiest and it usually isnt like that on weekdays.

There are quite a few restaurants and food stands to choose from in the park. Blossom Restaurant is one I do not recommend  it came with our park tickets from the travel company. For a buffet restaurant, we only had 6 types of food to choose and they were mostly tasteless. My kid and I both had tummy problems after that too. 22 Aug 2024
My kids love this place. All the shows are excited. You have to arrange your time to catch all the shows
Buy tickets online and book a roundtrip car to take your family to the safari
After watching all the show, the driver will pick up you and go to the safari zone where you can see the animals without barrier
The buffet is so so, acceptable Safari world, Bangkok was a fantastic experience. Reach early and go on weekdays to avoid crowds. There was various shows throughout the day which start exactly at the given time. Take a map and plan your day accordingly. We loved the orangutan and elephant show. The dolphin show was too crowded. You also get to click pictures with birds, tiger and orangutan for an extra charge. An experience for kids and adults alike. The food served at the savana restaurant is average quality. But there are other cafes all along the way. The best part for. Me was the safari in the car and the giraffe feeding. The former lets you see animals at close range in their open environments while you are locked in the car. A Must visit!","Monday: Closed

For hygiene purpose should wear diaper for your pet and clean up after your pet when using the parkfor happiness of every visitors.  It's great to have a place to bring my dog and take the leach off. The dog run enclosure was sandy, and I had to wash my dog when I got home. The sand was in her paws and around her mouth since she was playing with her ball. But my dog loved play time, and it was worth visiting. I will definitely go back. There should be more places like this around Bangkok. See you all there. Good place to play with your dogs. Quiet and clean. Some water available and small walking pool to wash the dogs after from the sand. Its covered with green tree shadow so not too hot in the day time Big and clean  so many dog friends you can find here. You need to get microchip done for your pet before coming here. They provide microchip service too, but occasionally.

One star I cannot give is because here is lack of information. When there is some event, nobody tells you. They should announce and they could have made this place more famous and profitable no shops here, no food no water sold here

Overall, I love everything here, sufficient parking space, ok toilet  security guards and it is absolutely FREE!! My dog loves coming here either for morning or evening walkies","Monday: 5:00 AM – 9:00 PM

I recently had the incredible opportunity to attend a Bruno Mars concert in Bangkok, Thailand, and it was nothing short of spectacular. The stadium was packed, a sea of people stretching as far as the eye could see, yet remarkably, it remained cool and comfortable despite the sweltering heat outside. This made the whole experience even more enjoyable.

Bruno Mars was absolutely phenomenal. His performance was electric, full of energy and charisma, truly showcasing his worldclass talent. The live music, the vibrant atmosphere, and his dynamic stage presence combined to create an unforgettable show. Every song was performed with such passion and precision that it left the audience captivated.

The overall production of the concert was impressive, with topnotch sound and lighting that perfectly complemented his performance. It was an evening of pure entertainment, and Bruno Mars proved once again why he is considered one of the best live performers today.

Attending this concert was a fantastic experience, and I would highly recommend seeing Bruno Mars live if you have the chance. It's an exhilarating event that music lovers should not miss! A must visit if you get a chance to watch the Thai national team. Amazing atmosphere. Its not the best place to visit when it rains and dont bring your car because the traffic is bad on match days Yesterday, I visited the soccer stadium to watch the soccer game between Korea and Thailand.
It was a 730 p.m. game and it was 20 minutes away from our accommodation, so I left home at around 430 p.m.
I took a taxi to hear that parking was not available, but the road to the stadium was so blocked that I arrived after 530 p.m.
My ticket was not a reserved seat, so I sat on a firstcome, firstserved basis, but the children were reluctant to sit down because they said there was a lot of bird droppings in the seats. 555
I took a bottle of water with me, but I couldn't take it inside, so I took it away.
And there was a place where only two water and coke were sold.
Even if you get paid more, it would be nice if you put a lid on it.
People bought several and went to the seats, but it was too far and it was hard to find a seat, so I was very anxious to carry them without a lid.
It was so hot and hard throughout the game, but it was good to see a good game. AFC ACL2

Great stadium, clean toilet.

Public transport.
Come by Airport Link Phaya Thai  Ramkamhaeng  then take a but to RU or take a bus to RU. Was here twice both for concert. Actually the stadium is too big for a concert, if your seat is on third floor you hardly see anything on stage. The steps are high and steep so don't recommend for people with heart and movement problems. The organizing procedure for a concert is as professional as in Singapore.
The traffic is a huge problem. No metro or sky train near here. The nearest station is Rakhamheang station which is 5km away. After a concert the Rakhamheang road is totally packed, no bus can go through it. Taxi and motor taxi fares skyrocket. To avoid traffic jam, catch a water taxi to Saphan Mit pier then walk to the station, it's very cheap and easy to commute. Water taxi ends its service around 7pm so after the concert the only way to get out of the crowd is walking as far as you can and bargain with taxi drivers.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 4:30 PM

This is now a venue for covid shots. There was no signage from the main youth center.

Process is really clear. Just fill out the form and everything else will be guided from there.

Went to have the shot a little after lunch. It was really fast and efficient. Everything  finished within an hour, including the printing of a new certificate. Kudos to all working there even during the weekends . Large, variety of outdoor places for doing activity for free. Not looking old even though it has been open for a very long time.

Thammasat Stadium,"99 Tambon Khlong Nung, Amphoe Khlong Luang, Chang Wat Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand",4.4,14.06803,100.598913,"Amazing atmosphere in the stadium when its full capacity. A little far from Bangkok city but if you get a chance to watch a big match in Thai football you must visit this stadium Thammasat Stadium, located in Rangsit, Pathum Thani, is a striking venue that impresses with its considerable size and capacity. Hosting around 25,000 seats, it stands out as one of the larger stadiums in Thailand, capable of accommodating a significant number of fans and ensuring a vibrant atmosphere for various events.

I recently attended a match between Bangkok United FC and Uthai Thani, part of the 2nd Thai Premier League, and the experience was remarkable. The stadium's vastness is immediately noticeable, providing ample seating and good sightlines from nearly every section. The crowd was enthusiastic, and the venues facilities efficiently managed the influx of supporters, contributing to an enjoyable matchday experience.

Overall, Thammasat Stadium is a topnotch facility for football fans and large events, offering an impressive blend of size, comfort, and atmosphere. Whether you're a local supporter or a visiting fan, it's a fantastic place to catch a game and soak in the passion of Thai football. Football is causing damages to the running track by loading heavy equipment on the track with logo signs or cars from U17 AFC and ambulance parking on the track. The trash that's left over onto the track that maintenance does not clean upwater bottles, taping, zip ties, nails, screws, dirt, rocks, etc. The sports manager shows no care for the stadium and others who use the stadium, he's just happy getting paid. Also he does not communicate in advance to those who use the stadium. Movie crews are allowed to drill holes into the track. The preparation for freshy games the students arrive during our training sessions and stand in the way. But during their set up the stadium is closed to us for training...?????!!!! Makes no sense and no respect for others.

Stadium great for soccer fans people are posting but no one is talking about how awful the damages for the athletics fans. And those training on their from the national team. Great when we were the only team using the stadium. Any trash on the soccer field is tossed onto the track. Just love the respect. And I would be ashamed how the track looks compared to smaller schools. I'm embarrassed when foreign athletes come here for training camp. They ask this is the national team track?!?!?

Finally, yesterday a football team showed their true colors which they try to show a great image for fans. Yesterday, afternoon a lady on the phone who works for a certain club where our national athletics team train as well said that, ""club name pays for the stadium so they do not have to tell when they have training or games. And that everyone knows this."" And they placed fake turf on the track which we use to run on and the women said,"" if we damage the turf we are responsible to fix it."" But yet they put the turf on the track used for running and they have damaged the track and used the hurdles to hold up their sponsors signs and zip tie it so I'm unable to use the hurdles for training but yet they feel they are entitled to everything. And their use of power and money in a bad way no empathy or care for other sports. I have never experienced this in America. We all respect each other and communicate to work together. I have two experience with different Thai clubs who has used this stadium for home. I wouldn't be surprised if all Thai clubs use their power and money to let you know this is how things work and you should know this. Definitely ego problems and no respect for others. That goes same for TU sports manager.

And this is why the athletics association doesn't want to repair the track because TU management and the football team will continue damaging the new track. I recently had the pleasure of visiting Thammasat Stadium for a match between True Bangkok United and Port FC, and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed with my experience. The stadium's management and cleanliness were exceptional, making for a seamless and enjoyable experience.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by friendly and helpful staff who directed me to my seat. The stadium itself was clean and wellmaintained, with ample seating and excellent views of the pitch. The seats were comfortable and provided plenty of legroom, ensuring a comfortable viewing experience throughout the match.

The management of the stadium was equally impressive. The entire experience was organized and efficient, with clear signage and helpful staff to guide me through the stadium. The food and drink options were also topnotch, with a wide variety of choices and highquality offerings.

Throughout the match, the atmosphere was electric, with fans cheering on their respective teams with passion and enthusiasm.

Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with Thammasat Stadium and its management. The cleanliness and organization of the stadium made for a seamless and enjoyable experience, and the passionate fans made for an unforgettable atmosphere. I would highly recommend a visit to Thammasat Stadium for any sports fan visiting Bangkok. So  cool to be here to experience Bankok united in the Asian champions league!

New Lumpinee Boxing Stadium,"6 Ram Inthra Rd, Khwaeng Anusawari, Khet Bang Khen, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10220, Thailand",4.4,13.8670502,100.6087762,"Visited on a Saturday morning for the 10am fights and regret the early breakfast as the stadium has 34 restaurants selling nice street food but we were too full to try. There are also drinks you can buy but you are not allowed to take these bottles into the stadium with you.

The ticket price is 800baht for standard seats and double that for ringside. We could sit anywhere apart from ringside and were right by the fighters entrance with elevation that made it easy to see the action.  Much preferred to the lower VIP seats where you could mostly see the ring cables.

The fights were unexpectedly high intensity with one match resulting in blood drawn and one with an actual knockout. Still the matches that went to a decision were still exciting and the format was very quick so there was no extensive waiting.

It makes sense at the matches were televised online live and the production very well done particularly the slick camera work for replays. Favourite place.
Amazing crowd.
Go oftentimes for one championship.
Best place to watch boxing  I had the pleasure of visiting the New Lumpinee Boxing Stadium in Bangkok to witness the One Championship card matches, and it was an incredible experience. The stadium was impressive, with a capacity of over 5,000 people and stateoftheart facilities.

The fights were intense and thrilling, with some of the best fighters in the world showcasing their skills. The main event of the night was between two highly skilled fighters, and the atmosphere in the stadium was electric as they battled it out in the ring.

In the end, the results of the One Championship card matches on Saturday, February 25, 2023 were as follows

Main Event Champion vs. Champion World Title Bout  Winner FABRICIO ANDRADE
CoMain Event Featherweight Muay Thai world championship  Winner TAWANCHAI PK. SAENCHAI
Women's catchweight submission  Winner DANIELLE KELLY

The New Lumpinee Boxing Stadium provided a fantastic setting for the fights, with great views from every seat and a lively atmosphere that added to the excitement of the matches.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting the New Lumpinee Boxing Stadium to witness some of the best fighters in the world battle it out in the ring. With topnotch facilities and exciting matches, it is an experience that any fight fan won't want to miss. Clean toilets, small food court with descent prices. Drink prices easy. Goodview from all corners. Easy to get a taxi home. Amazing experience ! We were at the ringside and we felt like VIP! We saw everything, even sweat and blood, and I recommend it !! My most favorite part is how the fighters are respectful to one another, hugging and cheering up the one who lost !","Monday: Closed

Walk up a central spiral staircase to the top floor with 360 views of greater Bangkok. Many Buddhas on display and placards with wisdom of Buddhist teachings.

Close to canal boat pier, queens art gallery, museums, fort and many other places to visit I hands down think this is the most beautiful temple in Bangkok. Its such a hidden gem. Yes the grand palace is beautiful, but if you have time, make sure you go to this temple! Its worth your time! Just keep in mind the opening hours. From memory it closes at 5pm. Very nice temple. Well maintained with some educational instillations, including a series of nice plaques of Buddhist virtues in Thai and in English.

The temple is laid out in layers, with the ground floor being an exhibition explaining the history and origins of the temple. The second floor being a library, where one can freely take books and give a donation. I found 5 small books and offered 100 THB which the staff said was more than enough.

Then on the upper floors are shrines, statues of Buddha and at the very top an amazing viewpoint and a relic of Buddha.

The surrounding grounds has other smaller temples and shrines which are also enjoyable to view. Very beautiful and decorative Wat Buddhist Temple. Just in the background of the Royal Pavilion. Please stroll around the temple walls. There are so many beautiful buildings, but the main attraction is the many golden spired buildings.

Ratchanatdaram is a Buddhist temple wat located at the intersection between Ratchadamnoen Klang and Maha Chai Road, in Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok. Meaning Temple of the Royal Niece, the temple was built to the order of King Nangklao Rama III for his granddaughter, Princess Somanass Waddhanawathy in 1846. It is popularly known as Loha Prasat, literally meaning the iron palace. I visited by foot this temple because this place is near my hostel. Easy to go and beautiful architecture. There are 2 main building into one compound. Quite place and not complex visitors.

Just too beautiful to leave all this behind and go back to reality.

I am sure I will come back definitely. Great views of Wat Arun at sunset.
Beware, it does get busy, as tourists, social media 'influencers'  it seems every amateur model in the city turns out to take photos here!
So if you want to set up a tripod, come early.
It's all worth it though. Free entry, great views  lots of nearby local eateries  bars. Recommended place to see the Wat Arun temple across the river. There is no entrance fee. However this place is usually packed with tourist. Definitely one of the best places to watch sunset in Bangkok. One of the great spots to slowly watch sunset, selfie or do a group photo to mark your Bangkok trip with the citys most iconic landmark.

The serene atmosphere, stunning architecture, and rich cultural heritage make it a mustvisit destination. Whether you are looking for a moment of peace, spiritual fulfillment, or simply a beautiful place to explore, this temple offers it all. The intricate details and sacred ambiance provide a perfect setting for reflection and reverence. Highly recommended for all travelers. One of the famous temples in Yaowarat offers many religious activities. The temple has a great atmosphere and better rules than many others, as it doesn't allow the use of incense, which usually produces a lot of smoke. I recently stopped by the temple on my birthday, and it was remarkable. Just enjoy the peace and harmony of the temple and take part in the cleansing ceremony. It was a very pleasant morning spent coming to this temple. Personally speaking, had it been less crowded, it'd have been more peaceful and gratified. One of the most beautiful and famous shrines in Bangkok!  Recommend coming here early in the morning and either using the MRT or getting a taxi to come here since there is no parking inside the shrine.  There are so many Chinese God figures here for worship!  Even if you are not Buddhist, just to come here and see the ritual, art, and decoration is worth the experience!","Monday: 8:00 AM – 4:30 PM

Beautiful pagodas build on a boat like structure and this should be the main reason to go here cause it makes it stand a bit out from other temples. Theres no temple dogs so you can safely visit this place with your kids also. Interesting temple  situated only a few minutes walk from the BTS Saphan Taksin. Its on the main busy  Charoen Krung Road. Its a big area with a few interesting buildings.   Door staff not over friendly to Farang.  But outside very friendly as per usual in Bangkok  throughout Thailand.   Large boat structure dominates the site.  You can buy flower and incense sticks to light inside the small Buddha area inside the body of the boat upstairs . Recommended .. Wat Yannawa  the boat temple, is a Buddhist temple Wat in Bangkok on Charoen Krung Road, Sathon district.

While most people are on their way to Icon Siam or Asiatique  Its only a 5minute walk to from Saphin Taksin BTS station. The inside shrine is very cool, lots to look at, but without being able to read Thai, very difficult to learn and translate what things are. Always a personal struggle when you cant understand the meanings of things  Also, no photos allowed inside and not very friendly volunteers towards foreigners inside. Only English was what would you like to buy. All my other interactions outside were great and the young monks on site were a joy to watch.

Entry is free. Lots of places on site for donations. Give yourself an hour to walk around and make your way to the river to feed the fishes.
I always bring lots of change and 20baht bills.

The temple was built during the Ayutthaya Kingdom, before the founding of Bangkok. It was originally called Wat Kok Khwai  because the community of Dawei people in the area bought and sold buffalo later, it was renamed as Wat Kok Krabue .
During the reigh of King Rama I, the temple gained royal status and the ubosot was built. During the reign of King Rama III, a viharn was built in the shape of a Chinese junk boat. The temple was renamed as Wat Yannawa, which translates as the boat temple. The two chedis on the deck represent masts and the altar at the back represents the wheelhouse. Because of this unique structure, locals call the temple sampao chedi the Chinese junk with chedis. Wat Yannawa Thai , commonly known in English as ""the boat temple"", is a Buddhist temple Wat in Bangkok on Charoen Krung Road, Sathon district. The temple has a long history from the Ayutthaya era to the present. During the rule of King Rama III, a viharn was built in the shape of a Chinese junk, giving the temple the nickname ""the boat temple"". This construction inside the temple houses a space where people pray a nearby ubosot enshrines Buddha images and illustrations of the Loi Prathip Royal Lantern Festival . Additional exterior buildings enshrine a Buddha relic from Sri Lanka and the Goddess of Mercy.

Wiki Free Admission. Just a short walk from Saphan Taksin Station.

I normally like to go straight to the back where the pier is. This is the place where I will spend hours feeding the fish. One loaf of bread is only 20 baht, it can help ease the pain of hunger of the bigger fish  and also prevent the small fish from getting eaten. Happy Feeding.

 Do not feed the pigeons. Its against the law. As tourists, we have to respect others cultures, customs, traditions and laws.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 5:00 PM

One of the highlights for me was the opportunity to feed the turtles with bananas and papaya. They are incredibly cute and it's a unique experience that I highly recommend. Additionally, you can climb up a narrow staircase to the top of the temple, which offers an interesting perspective of the temple and its surroundings. It's great that access to the temple is free, as true places of worship should be. However, I would suggest that visitors consider leaving a donation to support the maintenance of the temple and the work they do there. Overall, a mustvisit place with a serene and welcoming atmosphere. One of the most enchanting and tranquil temples I visited in Bangkok.

Completed construction in 1855. Its stupa was destroyed by thunderbolt later and eventually got fully repaired. Little museum you walk through to see all the amazing relics they unearthed while fixing the temple is cool. A local, peaceful temple next to Saphan Phut Bridge.  Worth a visit if you are in the area.  You can climb up to visit the interior of the Chedi.  Very beautiful inside. Beautiful temple and sometimes forgotten because of the focus on Wat Arun. There is a small nice museum and you can climb the tower. The turtle pond makes it really special.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 8:00 PM

The aroma of grilled seafood, pad thai, and coconut desserts wafts through the air, enticing passersby to indulge.

The pier is particularly vibrant in the evenings when the area transforms into a lively market. Local vendors set up stalls, selling handmade crafts, souvenirs, and street food, creating a festive atmosphere that attracts both locals and tourists. The riverside view during sunset is breathtaking, providing a perfect backdrop for memorable photographs.

In conclusion, Tha Tian Pier  is more than just a transportation hub it is a vibrant cultural spot that connects visitors to some of Bangkoks most treasured landmarks. Whether you are using it as a transit point or spending time enjoying the local food and scenery, Tha Tian Pier is a delightful experience that captures the essence of life along the Chao Phraya River. It's an essential stop for anyone looking to dive deeper into Bangkok's rich heritage while enjoying the beauty of the river and its surroundings. Get across to Wat Arun from this pier for just 5 bhat instead of private boats who will charge 40 bhat unless you're doing a tour. If you want to go to Wat Arun from Wat Pho you need to take a few minute's boat ride from this pier. Now it costs 5 baht per trip. You can go easily from Wat Pho to Wat Arun with the boat from this pier. You just need to buy and pay with coin on the spot. It only takes 15 minutes to reach the Wat Arun Pier on the other side.",no operation time,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment"
Wat Mahabut (Mae Nak Phra Khanong),"749 On Nut 7, แขวง อ่อนนุช, Khet Suan Luang, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10250, Thailand",4.6,13.7146238,100.607505,"The shrine of Mae Nak stands next to Klong Phra Khanong, at Wat Mahabut, a large temple on Soi 77 off Sukhumvit Road On Nut Road. The shrine is a low building under large trees with a roof that encompasses the tree trunks. The main shrine has several minor shrines around it.

A beautiful young woman named Nak, who lived on the banks of the Phra Khanong canal, had an undying love for her husband, Mak.

While Nak was pregnant, Mak was conscripted into the Thai Army and sent to war where he was seriously wounded in some versions it is the Kengtung Wars, while others are not specific.
While he was being nursed back to health in central Bangkok, Nak and their child both died during childbirth. But when Mak returned home, he found his loving wife and child waiting for him. Neighbors warned him that he was living with a ghost but he rebuffed them.

One day, as Nak was preparing nam phrik, she dropped a lime off the porch. In her haste to retrieve it, she stretched her arm to an impossible length to pick it up from the ground below. Upon seeing this, Mak realized his wife was a ghost. That night, Mak sneaked out the house and fled with Nak in pursuit. According to Thai folklore, ghosts are afraid of sticky Blumea leaves so Mak hid behind a Blumea balsamifera Thai  pronounced nat bush.
He then ran into Wat Mahabut temple, which as holy ground, a ghost cannot enter.
In her grief, Nak terrorized the people of Phra Khanong, furious at them for causing Mak to leave her. However, a powerful monk captured Nak's ghost and after confining her in an earthen jar, threw it into the Phra Khanong canal.

There are regional variations to the rest of the story. In one, an old couple new to Phra Khanong find the jar while fishing in another two fishermen dredge up the jar. In both cases, Nak is freed when the jar is opened.

In alternative versions, a venerable monk named Somdet Phra Phutthachan To Phrommarangsi defeats Nak by confining her spirit in the bone of her forehead and binds it to his waistband. Legend says the waistband is currently in the possession of the Thai royal family. Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartivongse, Prince of Chumphon, also claimed to have had the relic. In another, the monk assured Nak that in a future life she would be reunited with her beloved husband, so she voluntarily departed for the afterlife.

Wiki A nice wat to visit because I was curious about the story of Mae Nak. It feels really spritual, and lots of pigeon haha This temple is amazing their is a big lottery market.
I the video if u could place the coin in the middle ur wish would come true. Just a rumor lol. But see I could stand the coin in the top of every coin amazing. Wow
And still be careful their is a rumor about elder spirit Mae Nak. We visited the temple on Songkran day. There was a wonderful market on! The temple is home to a cool shrine dedicated to the ghost of a woman who died in childbirth. The temple is said to be a very lucky place, so naturally there are tons of lottery ticket vendors scattered throughout the grounds. This temple is worth a visit when travelling in Bangkok. It has a slightly different atmosphere to the other temples that I have visited. Beautiful wat no ticket needed. Lovely place to worship Mae nang kwak and has lots of food stalls and worship items. You can purchase lottery tickets aswell. Not far from central Bangkok. I highly recommend to visit this beautiful wat temple. ","Monday: 7:30 AM – 5:30 PM

Wat Ratchapradit Sathit Maha Simaram,"2 Saranrom Rd, Khwaeng Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand",4.6,13.7496571,100.4954828,"In scale of Bangkok, Wat Ratchapradit Sathit Maha Simaram is a small, even a tiny temple. The temple is located beside Saranrom Park, and it is, of course, very beautiful, and historic, too. For a regular visitor there are numerous details to wonder, and  during our visit closed  the Viharn is amazing, even exceptional... one can just marvel what there is inside that fabulous building. As said, the temple is very beautiful but doesn't maybe belong to those for an ordinary tourist ""must see"" temples. Will need to revisit this temple.
Closed for mother's day. The custodians on duty cleaning for the day but the temple doors themselves closed.
Small site but with great detail and some banners posted on the outside about the history of the temple  only in Thai. Ratchapradit Sathitmahasimaram Temple was built in 1864 His intention is that this temple shall be one of the three main monasteries of the city according to the tradition since Sukhothai period, namely Wat Mahathat, Wat Raja Burana and Wat Ratchapradit Sathan.

His Majesty King Mongkut originally named the temple as ""Rajapradit Sathitdhammayuttikaram Temple, The Temple of the Dhammayut Order specifically dedicated the land especially to Dhammayut monks. His will manifested in the royal edict, the marble slab behind the Buddhas hall, and the poems engraved on the monasteryzone marker pillars. After that the name was changed to ""Wat Ratchapradit Sathitmahasimaram, the Temple with the Great Monastery Zone Markers. Since there was no chapel in this temple, they used the zone marker pillars around the temple, both the Buddhas and the Sanghas zones, to indicate the boundary that the ceremony can be performed.
In 1665, His Majesty King Mongkut invited Phra Ssanasobhaa Sa Pussadeva, the tobe 9th supreme Patriarch of Thailand to be the first abbot. He was King Rama IV student and one of the ten first monks in the Dhammayut Order.

His Majesty King Mongkut paid great attention in decorating the temple with fine arts. He demanded that the carving on the door and windows emulated that of Wat Suthat, the inside window carved in the Japanese style of Wat Nang Chee, on top of every door and window having an emblem of the crown, the kings sigil, and the stars on the ceiling inspired by that of Wat Rajapraditsathan and Wat Suwan Dararam of Ayutthaya. Furthermore, there are paintings of deity groups roaming freely over the sky, the mural of royal ceremonies in 12 months which were painted in the reign of King Rama V with the background of the previous reign in order to reflect the prosperity under the rule of King Rama IV. Inside the temple is the famous Buddha image, Phra Sihanga Patimakorn, under which is where the royal ashes of King Mongkut were placed.
There are a large number of His Majesty King Mongkuts relevant edifices and antiquities in Wat Ratchapradit such as the royal temple which illustrates The Great Crown of Victory on the gable, the crowntopped pulpit as Rama IVs sigil.

Psna Cetiya the marble pagoda is a Sri Lankan style pagoda, inspired by the detail in the commentary of Mahparinibbna Sutta that the Emperor Ashoka had built the rockpagoda
Prasat Phra Boromarup and Prasat Phra Trai Pidok are the Khmerstyled buildings, inside of which are the statue of King Rama IV and 150 yearsold palmleaf manuscripts of the Pali Canon in the bookshaped wooden boxes respectively. Originally, these buildings were constructed in the reign of King Rama V with marbles with the fourfaced god, Brahman, on the top, then they were rebuilt in the reign of King Rama VI. THE FIRST CLASSED ROYAL MONASTERY OF RATCHAWORAWIHARN WAS BUILT FROM KING RAMA IV'S BELIEF THAT TRADITIONAL ROYAL CEREMONIES IN THE CITY REQUIRED THREE TEMPLES NAMELY WAT MAHATHAT, WAT RATCHABURANA AND WAT RAJAPRADIT.

AS BANGKOK HAD NIETHER WAT RAJAPRADIT NOR A THAMMAYUTIKA NIKAI TEMPLE CLOSE TO THE GRAND PALACE, WHILE WAT BOWONNIWETWIHARN WAS NOT CONVENIENT FOR THE KING AND ROYAL FAMILIES TO TRAVEL TO AND FRO, HE THEN ORDERED TO BUILD THE TEMPLE.

IN THE REIGN OF KING RAMA V, THE ASHES OF KING RAMA IV WERE KEPT UNDERNEATH THE PRINCIPAL BUDDHA IMAGE IN UBOSOT THE ORDINATION HALL.

THE MURAL PAINTINGS IN UBOSOT DEPICT 12 ROYAL CEREMONIES AND A SOLAR ECLIPSE WHICH IS A MEMORIAL TO KING RAMA IV'S TRIP TO OBSERVE A SOLAR ECLIPSE AT TAMBON WAKO OF PRACHUAP KHIRI KHAN PROVINCE IN 1868. The beautiful temple very close to the grand palace just 2 mins by walk. This temple is pretty quiet, but stunning decoration of Buddhist style.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM

It was designed in Renaissance style, with pure Thai style roof, or the nickname as ""The Westerner with Thai hat"".

Indy Market @Dao Khanong,"Dao Khanong, Chom Thong, Bangkok 10150, Thailand",4.3,13.690955,100.4805646,"I really liked this market which was full of locals. It is smaller but I liked that, it was just enough for a one night out. Half of the market are food stalls many dont have english menu and half of it are mostly clothes. There are also some bars with live music. Prices in markets are really afordable, I think even cheaper that chatchuk market. Adventureous hidden heaven for locals. Not so touristy, a wode selection of local cuisine. Simplicity i actually chanced upon a kid playing with her pet, a yellow real life baby duckling. That was authenticity of this place. Kid roam around on their own safely. Best is the place where there are live band and bar to sit around. Love the fish bowl size mojito. The location is a bit out of the way and not very convenient to get to at night. There is quite a lot of food and a variety of small goods, good for spending the evening, but maybe not the best place if you are looking for food or clothes. Also when we left the place to take a taxi, we encountered a refusal and another one asking for a price, the third driver saw us too poor and offered to pick us up. Very pleasant night Market with a somewhat more local vibe than some of the others I went to in Bangkok. It is quite bog actually and has a variety of food and shopping available. You can even get glasses done for a reasonable price herehowever it takes about 1 day to make . Very interesting mix of food available and food was quite reasonably priced One of Bangkok Night Market to visit. Lots of food and alcohol to go for. Many clothes to buy but not the cheapest thou. Recommend to eat as much as possible to have the best for your night. Packet those you cant already food back to your hotel. Walk as you go naturally, doesnt need to hesitate to buy what you want.

Few vintage shops dotted mostly at the start of market but more for browsing. If u into vintage, better go to train market surburb of Bangkok but worth the trip. Perhaps I've visited on an off day Sunday evening but there doesn't seem to be much going on.  Plenty of deserted sections with just a handful of tshirt and vintage stores and empty bars serving alcohol to teenagers. the place looks like it's waiting for a renaissance. in any case I'd say avoid going on a sunday you might have better luck on a weekend night. p.s. the actual vintage market is on the opposite side of the road, as marked on google maps Nice place to take.
