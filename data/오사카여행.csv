Osaka Castle,"1-1 Ōsakajō, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 540-0002, Japan",4.4,34.6872571,135.5258546,"Today, we visited Osaka Castle... it is  magnificent looking from the outside,  but from the inside, they have changed it into a museum, so I have no idea how it looked like a few hundred years back, other than telling us it used to house their gold and silver, so sounds like a central bank of old? The museum itself was okay. Now the area around it is also nice and very accessible and family friendly. Their main elevator was out of service, so I'm not sure what people with a disability or prams did as the place have at least a million steps you need to climb! The view from all the way at the top is very nice, with a small gift shop up there and another larger one downstairs. I won't spoil the story, but check out the story of the Lord who built the original castle, it has a twist in it that I didn't see coming! But the only hint I'll mention is that he was 57 when it happened. Buy tickets online as the line was huge, at least a 30minute wait, even though at the end of the line, you find 3 ticket vending machines! I think they could have easily doubled the number of those machines! Online tickets have a line of their own, and you get in within a minute. Worth the trip... Very beautiful and relaxing castle to visit. Get there early or make reservations to avoid lines. Either way you get in rather quickly.  Plenty to see and take in amazing views once you are atop the main observation deck. The view around the city is spectacular. The grounds themselves are worth a visit as well. Osaka Castle is a mustsee if youre in the city. The castle itself is stunning, with its towering structure and beautiful grounds. Inside, theres a museum that walks you through the history of the castle and Osaka. The views from the top are amazing, giving you a great look at the city. The surrounding park is a lovely spot for a peaceful walk or a picnic. Its wellmaintained and easy to navigate. Overall, its a fantastic mix of history and nature, worth visiting! Osaka Castle is absolutely mesmerizing at night! I walked around the grounds, and the castle looked stunning with its beautiful illumination against the night sky. The peaceful atmosphere made it a perfect spot to take in the impressive architecture and enjoy a quiet evening stroll. Even though I didnt go inside, exploring the exterior and the surrounding park was well worth it. Highly recommend visiting during the evening for a unique and serene experience! Definitely worth a visit! Incredible architecture and history.

Buy your entrance passes ahead of time. There was a long line when we went, even early in the morning. You can skip the queue. Get the audio guide too.

The elevator wasn't working but the top floor has wonderful views of the city. Worth the climb. There's also golf cart stops at the entrances if you don't want to walk too much around the compound. Especially after the walk from the station.

There's several vending machines about 100m straight out of the exit.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM

The Kaiyukan is beautifully designed, with huge tanks that give you an immersive experience of marine life. The highlight for me was the massive central tank with the whale sharkits breathtaking! The exhibits are wellorganized, taking you on a journey from Japans seas to the Pacific Ocean, with diverse species like jellyfish, penguins, and otters. The layout is easy to navigate, and there are plenty of interactive displays for kids. Its a great place for families, and you can easily spend a few hours here. Worth every penny! A large array of sea creatures with big enclosures for them, which is great. Have accessible access with wheel chair spots to make it easier for them to see things. The whole thing is one big loop down, so it's easy to navigate. No amount of words would, of course, really describe this, got to be there to get the experience. A bonus, you ask? It's close to a shopping mall and the biggest Ferris wheel I've seen, so you can do a few things while there. We took one bus all the way there from close to Osaka station for the flat fee of 210 yen for adults and half that for children even though it was a 34minute trip. It's worth a visit for adults and kids... By far one of the best aquariums I have ever been to. Fully immersive and well done with tons of different sea animals and some land animals. The building feels new and modern, and the aquarium alone takes at least 90120 minutes to complete. Well worth it and this was my second visit here. You should certainly buy tickets online beforehand to beat the crowds waiting at the ticket counter. If you go on a weekend, expect chaos. It's really busy at that time. Nice mall close by as well with some cool souvenirs and restaurants. An amazing aquarium, spent hours just watching and looking.

We did have to book a time slot to enter but well worth the wait.

It was very busy, just take your time and enjoy the place.

Took a good part of the day but would recommend for sure. If you purchase tickets online it might be faster and they sell based on time slots.

We paid for the extra tour to view the whale sharks in person. You cannot bring your phone and belongings into the viewing area free lockers are provided when you view them. The entrance to the viewing is not that far once you entered the aquarium. They let you in even if you're late for your slot I saw some come in after 510 minutes","Monday: 10:30 AM – 8:00 PM

Osaka Castle Main Tower (Osaka Castle Museum),"1-1 Ōsakajō, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 540-0002, Japan",4.5,34.6872962,135.5258605,"This is a stunning building and well worth the wait in the queue to get in. This tower was rebuilt in 1931 based on pictures of the original 1585 tower. Great views from the top.
You can cut out an often long queue by purchasing on the internet in advance. The castle grounds were really pretty and it was cool to see how there were 2 bodies of water surrounding the castle for defensive purposes. The inside of the castle has been transformed into a modern museum which I didnt really like as I wouldve liked to see the old interior. Theres also a photoshoot where you can dress up as a samurai which was really cool. Our first stop in country.
Early May 2024, cool overcast day, still plenty of crowds.
The view from the top was good and the exhibits were informative. 100 score for the beauty of sakura surroundings the place. First time coming and seeing the beautiful flowers is such a lucky moments to our family. Nearby have some street foods smell really good. You should find somewhere hidden to take pictures due to over crowded people there, especially hot season such as Sakura or maple leaf. From the outside it looks very nice, but as soon as you enter the grounds of the castle it looks a bit rundown. The gardens around it also look as if not much attention has been paid to them. I have not been to the castle myself.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM

It just loops around the moat and shows you a special rock with a face you can hardly even see. very nice place with nice view It's said to be a space to hide soldiers in case of an invasion, but from outside the moat, it looks like they were barely able to do it...

As stated in the explanatory version, the family crest of the feudal domain that built it is engraved on the stones of the stone wall. Osaka Castle Honmaru's only band ring ""Hidden Curve""
The enemy sneaked through the defenses of Osaka Castle's iron walls and invaded Gokuraku Bridge, Yamazato Maru, and Honmaru.
A secret castle tower where castle soldiers stand by and attack the enemy's rear by surprise.It's quite spacious.On the south side of the hidden castle tower, there is a tower towering beyond it Visited on April 17, 2022.

A kuruwa built when Osaka Castle was rebuilt during the Edo period. It is said that it was a place to hide soldiers by keeping the entrance inconspicuous.

The inconspicuous entrance means there are fewer tourists.
The stones on the stone wall had the stamps of the clans that carried them there, and you could see the barges floating in the moat below, making the scenery very beautiful.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Umeda Sky Building,"1-chōme-1-88 Ōyodonaka, Kita Ward, Osaka, 531-6023, Japan",4.3,34.7052872,135.4896527,"One of the best panoramic views Ive ever experienced! The Umeda Sky Building offers an incredible view of Osaka from its floating  observatory, and its very accessible. The entrance fee is quite affordable, making it a mustvisit for anyone who loves breathtaking cityscapes. You can see a perfect, uninterrupted view of Osakas skyline, which is absolutely stunning, especially at sunset. The openair deck is an amazing spot to just sit and take it all in.

However, it does get really hot during the summer, and I found myself looking for some shade after a while. Despite the heat, it was worth every moment, and I could stay there for hours just soaking in the view. Im hoping to come back someday during the winter season when its cooler and enjoy the view under different conditions. If youre ever in Osaka, this is definitely a place you dont want to miss! Get klook pass kansai is value for money, you can choose the number of venues you like to visit. If not Umeda sky building admission fee is 2000yen. I would say still worth to go if you are first time visiting Osaka like I do Daylight in Japan is kind of short, so be there around 4pm would be great to do your photography and immersed with the beautiful sunset. I didnt stay for the night lights of buildings. The sunset alone was already super captivating. Getting a good shot may be tough if you go on weekends and peak seasons many tourists and locals as well Oh, if you have bad knees like me, dont worry there are escalators and lifts to take you all the way up to the highest observatory deck!  Beautiful building.

As we have seen many viewing platforms on our trip to Japan also in Osaka, we only went up to the 39th floor. Up to that point it is free and tickets for the platform are also sold there for 2000 yen. We were not convinced by the price for the visit. The escalators can also be used free of charge. This building has an open roof top observation deck, so on a good day this is an added bonus. You'll get a decent 360 view of Osaka here and with Eagle eyes you can spot Osaka airport from the northern view. I'd also recommend adding the museum to your booking if you like a bit of history. Umeda sky deck is an architectural triumph, incorporating a very unique design that allows visitors to soak up the ambiance of viewing Osakas magnificent skyline!
Entry is via level 3 and costs 2000 pp which is very good value to see the city from internally and for the very brave on the sky walk.
Cafebar is available with great selection of craft beers and sensational coffee to sip as the sun sinks into the ocean.
A trip into the gift shop, offers a plethora of unique gifts and souvenirs.
Yay! I did it! Im terrified of heights, and was very challenged by this experience but super thrilled that I did it! Give it a go! Not to be missed when in Osaka!","Monday: 9:30 AM – 10:30 PM

Universal Studios Japan,"2-chōme-1-33 Sakurajima, Konohana Ward, Osaka, 554-0031, Japan",4.5,34.6656768,135.4323185,"Ive never seen so many people in one place. We did go during a major holiday and I cant stress enough how important the express pass is. Without it lines were 120 minutes plus for the major rides. I would consider. It mandatory to pay the express pass unless you are happy to spend a long time waiting. They do charge a lot. If the good news is it seems the restaurants are actually better value than the concessions. Our 3 course sit down in ac Italian lunch was 2700. Yen and a chicken leg from a concession stand was 1200 yen. And you had to stand in line for that and eat it in the street. I know which one I would prefer. And we didnt have a booking. For lunch. Simply walked in at 12pm.  The kids had a blast and many of the rides are really good. But I am glad its one and done for me I love Universal in Florida, and loved Universal Osaka just as much, if not more. First, it was unbelievably easy to get to the park and enter. The train station drops you off directly near the gate no need to navigate a city sized parking lot. I purchased my ticket and express pass via on Klook, and was able to enter with a screen shot of the ticket. Trying to purchase tickets directly on the Universal site can be very difficult, if not impossible.

The staff were all delightful, friendly, and super helpful. The staff here felt more like the cast members at Disney Parks. The rides are also diverse and super fun. Having the express pass helped get quickly onto the most popular rides and I would recommend getting one. I was super excited to get to ride Jaws, as it no longer exists in Orlando.

It was, of course, an all day event. If you want to do things totally unique to Japan, you might want to skip Universal. If you are a big fan of amusement parks and want to ride some of the exclusive rides, I can't recommend visiting here enough! This place is amazing. Weve been to both Universal parks in the US and Japan is as good as Florida. Each area is really well done and has its own Japanese flare and additions compared to the US. The staff are so helpful and wave at people all day.
We experienced Halloween which was so cool with zombies walking the park and scaring people. The Flying Dinosaur ride is the most thrilling ride Ive been on and Ive ridden a lot of thrill rides. If you love theme parks, or Nintendo, Universal Studios is a must!
Firstly, BOOK IN ADVANCE
Check a few months in advance when your planned date will become available to book and be ready to book as soon as they are released. Especially if you want to get express pass tickets. The express passes that we wanted were sold out when we booked but we got the next best ones.
I highly recommend the express pass if you want to go on lots of rides as it saves a lot of time queuing.
Food was good, we ate at the jaws restaurant. We had a shark sandwich and a BBQ shrimp sandwich which were both good.
Nintendo world is very impressive and again you need a special ticket to enter there and Harry potter world so check online to make sure you book that in advance. An Unforgettable Experience!

Universal Studios Osaka was truly unique! Super Nintendo World, especially Mario World, was a highlight  you can actively participate in games, and its something you wont find anywhere else. The Harry Potter area was also fantastic. The park itself is beautiful and very clean, with friendly staff who made the visit even better. Plus, it wasnt too expensive compared to other theme parks. Overall, an unforgettable experience!",no operation time,"tourist_attraction, amusement_park, point_of_interest, establishment"

Osakajo is a recreation of what was once a much larger complex, and home to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of the three great unifiers of Japan. Prior to this area being Osaka Castle, it was the site of the Honganji citadel, a nearly impenetrable fortress built by monks who unwisely went up against Oda Nobunaga. The donjon area you see today dates back to 1931, while the original Osakajo was completed in 1586. It was destroyeddamaged and rebuilt several times between 1615 and the days of WWII.

Line moved pretty quickly. Worth the Wait! This Tower is a Blast! 

The 30minute queue flew by! The elevator ride alone is an experience  it's like being launched into space with a super cool, Japanesestyle video briefing. Think dramatic, animeinspired visuals! Totally unique and definitely worth the wait.  Its Sunday after lunch and the line up to get up to the observation deck is quite long. If you want to go up the tower suggest to come early in weekday. Quite a bit of restaurants and entertainment shops nearby for all ages. The most popular type seems to be shooting targets for prize. Definitely enjoyed catching my own fish which was prepared as we liked! Fun for families and groups. Excellent teambuilding activity! Enjoyed how helpful and funloving the staff were.

Kiyomizuzaka,"5 Reinincho, Tennoji Ward, Osaka, 543-0061, Japan",3.7,34.655841,135.511923,"I passed this road every time I went to school. Didnt know it was a monument.
On some days, you can also see flocks of crows  murder hopping down the stairs.
If youre lucky usually therell be a Golden Retriever named FuChan.
Hes very friendly  definitely made my stay in Japan more memorable  Paved footpath stair, nothing special about it. The area is known for its famous hot springs, and the clear waters of Kinryu, Tosa Arisu, Masui, Yasui, Tamate, Kamei, and Osaka are called Tennoji's Seven Famous Waters.
A slope located on the north side of Mt. Arisu Kiyomizu Temple in Reijincho, Tennoji Ward, between Osaka Seiko Gakuin and Kiyomizu Temple. It forms part of Yokooji and Takeuchi Kaido Japan's oldest national highway. One of the seven slopes of Tennoji. From the north, Shingonzaka, Genshojizaka, Kuchinawazaka, Aizenzaka, Tenjinzaka, and Osaka. There is also a slope called Gakuenzaka, but does it have a new history? Cars can drive eastbound on a oneway street. It is not included in Tennoji Nanazaka. Tennoji Nanazaka is a series of seven slopes that climb from Matsuyamachisuji to the west side of Noboriyamachisuji from Tanimachi 9chome to Tennoji. It has become a temple town for Osaka Castle.

This is Osaka Castle, which stands at the northernmost tip of Kamimachi Plateau. If you go south along this Uemachi Plateau, you will end up at Shitennoji Temple, the head temple of the Japanese sect of Tennoji, and Yasui Shrine, the final resting place of Yukimura Sanada, who was active in the Osaka Summer Campaign. With the exception of Osaka, which is now a main road, the narrow cobblestone pavement and stone steps are impassable to cars, and the combination with the walls and stone walls on both sides is beautiful, making it a great spot for sketching and taking photos.

If you go up the same Kiyomizuzaka slope as Kiyomizudera in Kyoto, you will find Kiyomizudera. It is said that he invited the 11faced Kannon from Kiyomizudera Temple in Kyoto. There are places with spring water, a stage for Kiyomizudera Temple, and a panoramic view of the castle town of Osaka Castle.

Kiyomizudera is a Japanese Buddhist temple located in Reijincho, Tennojiku, Osaka City. The principal image is the elevenfaced thousandarmed Kanzeon Bodhisattva, and it is a branch temple of Shitennoji, the head temple of the Japanese sect. The full name is Mt. Arisu Seikoin Kiyomizudera. It is registered as a religious corporation with Seikoin. It is also known for having Tamade Falls, which is said to be the only natural waterfall in Osaka city.

Access Get off at JRSubway Tennoji Station and walk for about 10 minutes. Tennoji Nanazaka are seven slopes with historical value located on the west side of Uemachi Plateau in the center of Osaka City.
The third slope from the south side is Kiyomizuzaka.
Kiyomizudera, a temple on the south side of the slope, has the Elevenfaced ThousandArmed Kannon Bodhisattva, which was moved from the famous Kiyomizudera Temple in Kyoto, as its principal image. It is said that Kiyomizudera Temple is the origin of the name of this slope.
There are stone stairs and a slope next to them that is wide enough to push a bicycle along, giving me the impression that it is the most wellmaintained of all the Tennoji Nanazaka slopes.
The entrance from the Matsuyamachisuji side is very difficult to find, so if you don't check the map in advance, you may not be able to decide where to enter. As a landmark, go east at a small intersection with a car dealership called ""Nissan Tennoji Store.""
On the other hand, when accessing from the Tanimachisuji side, take the road south of Osaka Seiko Gakuin High School and continue forward while looking at the school's field on your right.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Spanning a vast area around the iconic Osaka Castle, the park offers a peaceful escape with beautiful walking paths, scenic ponds, and wellmaintained gardens. Whether youre a history buff or just looking for a serene spot to relax, the park has something for everyone. The observation platform offers breathtaking views of the city, and the museum inside provides a look into the castles past.
I visited in September, and the waiting time was around 20 minutes, which was quite reasonable. The queue moved quickly, and the staff were efficient and friendly. The surrounding park is beautiful. Frankly, it looks incredibly beautiful from the outside. But the inside has nothing to do with its exterior. It's a museum. If I remember correctly, it's 800 yen per person and taking photos inside is prohibited. They close the doors at 1630. The last people to enter are allowed to stay inside for 3040 minutes. The castle itself didn't mean much to me, but the surroundings and atmosphere are beautiful, you can take beautiful photos. Getting there is quite easy  straight forward. I feel there could be more assistance with tickets since there are two lines one with online ticket  one purchasing onsite. This might be confusing for the first time. Overall the castle is well equipped  you get to learn the history quite well  like the audiovisual part. The views at the top is breathtaking. A very beautiful sight for those that wish to visit later in the day past sunset. The crowd dies down and there is a sense of serenity and mystery about the place. The lights stayed on until about 10PM and provided a stellar view of the castle and its surroundings. The gardens and walks around the moats are gorgeous and provide lots of educational history for those interested.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Views not only provide sights of Osaka, but a birds eye view of Osaka castle. Displays containing pieces of the areas history, and detailed examples of life during each period. Worth a visit. Super awesome way to learn local history. Broken into very specific time periods on each floor. Worth spending a few hours wandering. Some sections make you feel as though youre living in the history structural replicas and scenic walls. Very organized path to follow through, and theres even an exhibit dedicated to archeology! Mainly to teach kiddos but can be fun for all ages! I am amazed by the level of delicacy of every single detail in the museum. Some English content to look at and search up.

How to fully absorb the place Highly recommended to scan the QR code wherever you see one and use translation app to read the information. We learned a lot about the history of Osaka food, art and architecture.

Ticket Please go to the museum the first day you arrive at Osaka. It is ideal to buy a set ticket  of Osaka Museum of History and Osaka Castle Museum.

Time Osaka Museum of History has 4 massive floors and Osaka Castle Museum has 8 also very comprehensive floors  Please make sure you have at least 3 hours for the museum and another 3 hours for the castle. We thought that it only takes 45mins and arrived at noon so it was a rush to enjoy Osaka Castle Museum later before the closing time at 5pm. Interesting museum dedicated to the history of Osaka, from the 6th century to modern times. Although it offers a lot of knowledge, the museum's focus on a single theme may not be suitable for the broadest audience. Nonetheless, the facility is clean, the exhibits are beautifully displayed, and entry is affordable at 600 yen. Its also a good place to escape the heat of a hot day. The view of Osaka Castle from the 10th floor is spectacular, although a designated photo area without window reflections would enhance the experience. Expansive museum that takes up several floors. Lots of exhibits detailing the history of Osaka from ancient times all the way up to the 21st century. I especially enjoyed the miniature dioramas that were extremely detailed and helped to provide a better understanding of the different architecture. Well worth the 45 dollar entry fee and a nice place to visit on a cloudier day. Close to the subway line and Osaka Castle which is an another benefit.","Monday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM

People come here for a breath of fresh air, take a walk, go running or even to barbecue and have a picnic. Tables and benches are already provided.

The name might be a little misleading as it is not a natural forest, but where trees are planted in commemoration of loved ones, hence the name Memorial Forest. There are wide concrete paths with benches along the way and every time I visit the park is very well kept. My favorite time of year to visit is around late November  early December due to the warm tones of gold and red fall foliage. We walked through the park on our way back from visiting Osaka Castle and it was so much more interesting that when we arrived from the other side of the castle.

There was a group of kids on stilts or on unicycles walking around. Nice place for barbecue. Offers a pleasant walk around the castle ","Monday: Open 24 hours

To get away from the huddle and buskers of all the people! Also beautiful people working or volunteering there! Thank you! April 9th, 2023

What a cool Temple within a cozy alley. Convenient for those who come to pray, pay their respects, and then keep it pushing. It's like a pit stop for prayer. A kind reminder that no matter how busy you are in life, you should always have time to stop, take a breather, pray and be grateful.

Located in Hozenji Yokocho Alley. Hozenji Temple is a hidden gem in Osaka! I visited on a weekday and didn't have to wait at all to enter. The atmosphere is serene and peaceful, making it a perfect escape from the busy city. The mosscovered statue is unique and beautiful. It's free to enter, and no advance tickets are needed. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the areait's a wonderful experience! Not a large temple, down a small, quiet street. The unusual thing is the mosscovered deities where people pray and pour water over the three statues. This small shrine is located in the heart of Namba, Hozenji temple is flocked by locals and tourists both day and night.

It is believed to bring good luck if you splash water on the mosscovered statue. I also recommend walking onto the Hozenji yokocho, which I also think, is a sight to behold at night.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Osaka Tenmangu Shrine,"2-chōme-1-8 Tenjinbashi, Kita Ward, Osaka, 530-0041, Japan",4.3,34.69605759999999,135.5126556,"This is a very traditional shrine. I came here for my child's Omiyamairi shrine visit, and I was very satisfied with how quickly we were able to proceed with the ceremony. However, there is little shade, so be cautious if you visit on a hot day. It's particularly important to take care if you have young children or elderly people with you. Despite the lack of shade, the experience was wonderful and the shrine's traditional atmosphere made it a memorable visit. Fantastic place to get away from the crowds of Osaka. Peaceful, quaint and minimal tourists.

There's worship areas and tourist spaces for people who just wish to look around and not take part in any religious ceremonies. Though there is a place to purchase items for offering and wishes.

Unfortunately it was lightly raining during my visit, but even still, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the scenery. The shrine is absolutely stunning with its intricate architecture and serene atmosphere. The peaceful ambiance made it a perfect place for reflection and tranquility. I was fascinated by the rich history and cultural significance of the shrine. The beautifully manicured gardens and the traditional structures added to its charm. Osaka Tenmangu Shrine, established in the 10th century, is a key shrine among many in Japan dedicated to Tenjin, the Shinto God of scholarship, who is associated with Sugawara Michizane, a notable scholar of the Heian Period.

Michizane liked plum trees, which are commonly found at Tenmangu Shrines, and the plum blossom motif serves as the symbol of these shrines.

Although Tenmangu Shrine in Osaka doesn't draw many foreign visitors like its counterparts in Tokyo and Kyoto, it holds significant importance for locals in Osaka.

Osaka Tenmangu is famous for the annual Tenjin Matsuri festival, held on July 24 and 25, which is ranked as one of Japan's top three festivals, along with Kyoto's Gion Matsuri and Tokyo's Kanda Matsuri. The festival features a joyful land and river procession, where the shrine's deity is paraded in a divine palanquin called mikoshi, accompanied by fireworks.

The shrine is conveniently located near the busy shopping street, Tenjinbashisuji.

I've visited the shrine a few times when I was in Osaka. Once, I had a good udon at the small restaurant inside the shrine grounds around lunchtime. It was a memorable meal. A big shrine in town. They have a big main hall for people to pray, one for stamps, charms and fortunes, and several others. The goshuin was nice and costs 500.","Monday: 5:30 AM – 6:30 PM

Site of Naniwanomiya-Daigokuden (Council Hall in the Imperial Palace),"1 Chome-6 Hoenzaka, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 540-0006, Japan",3.8,34.6805928,135.5232842,"Visited on April 17, 2022.
It was a hot day.
It is a spacious park that many families enjoyed.

The remains of Daigokuden have been restored. You can't really tell just by walking around, but if you look at it from the Osaka Museum of History, you can get a sense of the layout of the palace. There is a restored diorama in the museum, so it would be a good idea to compare it.

Naniwa Palace is said to be divided into an early and a late period.
In the first period, after the Itsumi Incident, Emperor Kotoku moved the capital to this area, and it is said that the imperial edict for reforms was issued here. It's very emotional.
After that, the capital was moved many times, and during the reign of Emperor Tenmu it was considered a multiple capital, but it is said to have been destroyed by fire.

In the later period, Emperor Shomu moved the capital from place to place, so it seems to have been the capital for about a year. After that, it is said that he returned to Heijokyo via Shikorakukyo.
However, it was also a suitable location as an entrance to foreign countries, and it seems that it remained as a shrine for some time afterwards. Origin of Osaka The ruins of Naniwa Palace are currently under construction. It can be clearly seen from the elevator hall of the Osaka Museum of History. The event introduction character for this part of the history museum is Prince Naka no Oe. It is related to Naniwa Palace in the first half. The foundations of the palace buildings can be seen on the glass floor of the foundation of the Osaka Museum of History. It is highly praised that Naniwa Palace, which was said to be a phantom, was excavated and the site was preserved on a large scale as a park. However, it would be better not to display the Daigokuden ruins as if they were a large stage made of concrete, which would make it difficult to see the location of the foundation stones, and give the viewer the misunderstanding that there was a stone building like that in China. . There's nothing special about it, but it seems like there was a lot going on in the past, so I'm excited to be here after researching it. In the summer, there are many people who sleep naked to get a tan. It's just a square with almost no structures. Good for a walk. It can also be used as an evacuation site in the event of a disaster. I think it is better not to build large structures in the future.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Tenjinzaka,"Japan, 〒543-0062 大阪府大阪市天王寺区伶人町１丁目５",3.8,34.6548287,135.5109236,"Ordinary paved footpath, nothing special about it. Serene local street. A slope in Reijincho, Tennoji Ward, Osaka City.
Its origin is the nearby Yasui Shrine Tenjinsama. Although it has dried up now, it is said that there was once a spring called Tennojiku Shichimeisui.
It is an impressive place that appears at the end of the animated movie Josee, the Tiger and the Fish, and has become a sacred pilgrimage spot among fans, along with nearby Aizenzaka. It is one of the seven slopes of Tennoji Temple and is so named because it is the path that leads to Yasui Tenjin Shrine from above. Although it is called seven slopes, there are actually eight slopes. These are Shingon, Genshoji, Kuchinawa, Aizen, Shimizu, Osaka, Shimodera, and Tenjinzaka. The spring water has dried up. Vehicles are not allowed on the cobblestone road, but you can pass with permission from the neighborhood association. This is related to residents and home deliverypostal services. This name comes from the west torii gate of Yasui Shrine as you go down Tenjinzaka and go to your left.

Actually, there is the north stone staircase of Yasui Shrine at the end of the slope, so it is a shorter cut from here, but this is the back entrance.
The west torii gate is the main entrance, so if you are going to visit the shrine, it is best to go from there if possible.

Yasui Shrine is famous for being the place where Yukimura Sanada passed away.
There is also a Yukimura statue and stone monument.

There is also a statue halfway up Tenjinzaka that recreates the image of water gushing out from Kamimachi Plateau.
Don't miss this either

Osaka has the image of being completely flat, but it actually has slopes that give it an atmosphere like this.
The area around Yuhigaoka along Tanimachisuji on Kamimachi Plateau has steep slopes continuing to the west, and there are many named slopes.
It is called ""Nanasaka of Tennoji""

from the north
Shingonzaka
Genshojizaka
Kuchinawazaka
Aizenzaka

There are many sights to see around the slope, and I don't think you could cover all of them in one day.
Moreover, there is Ikunitama Shrine at the northern end, and Shitennoji and Isshinji at the southern end.
I think it would be more realistic to visit the area in two parts the northern half and the southern half.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Just make sure to factor time for crowds as you need to wait for lifts and buy tickets also be polite in taking turns to do your photography. I would recommend to be there about late 3pm to 4pm daylight is short in Japan, dont forget! The sunset is so captivating! While some comments mentioned it being expensive, it really depends on what youre comparing it to. We purchased our tickets in advance, but you still need to queue up to scan your QR code and get the physical tickets.

Fortunately, the wait wasnt long, which was a pleasant surprise since we arrived a bit before sunset. We had a great time, and the views were fantastic. It's truly a beautiful place to visit. Beautifully constructed observatory. It was not too crowded during daytime and the openairskywalk offers phenomenal views over Osaka. There is a nice 360 degree indoor area with a caf where you can enjoy the view through huge windows with air condition  its totally worth it! Amazing view from the top. I highly recommend coming before sunset so that you can see the view during the day and at night. I wouldve given 5 stars but the line to go up was quite long we went on a Saturday. The value was very good, the ticket to go up was only 2000 yen. Nice place to visit to get 360 degrees view of the Osaka skyline. The place is well organised and there wasnt much of a queue when we arrived around 0930. Unusually you buy your entrance ticket half way through the ascent process after the elevator journey. Admission is AS15 and is worth it for the views and the experience of the open air views. There are some videos, stills and models of the design and construction process that are interesting too.  Worth a visit.","Monday: 9:30 AM – 10:30 PM

I only passed by while walking towards Osaka Station, but it was the perfect place to rest my body and eyes. I passed by when I was on a business trip.
It felt like an oasis in the city. In spring, cherry blossoms and magnolia flowers bloom, and although the mountain is small, it is gorgeous. However, the cherry blossoms fall quickly, so the period is short. You'll want to stop by for a short stroll.

It would have been great if they allowed two rounds instead of just one, which would make the ride feel more worth the cost. Still, its a fun experience if youre in the area and looking for some scenic views of Osaka. Must go! Forget about the Hep Five Ferris one. This is bigger and taller and of course come with better view!  only 900 yen for adult and you can choose to queue for the normal gondola or the full glass gondola usually longer queue and needs to wait cos there are fewer glass ones If you are in a rush, just go for the normal one and be stunned by the view. Very helpful and friendly staff at the ticket area and boarding lighting area! Thanks for the hardwork We accidentally timed our ride for sunset and it was gorgeous! The night time view is amazing. Ride is about 1520 minutes all around and only slightly scary for those apprehensive of heights. The pod rocks if you switch from one side to the other. The Ferris Wheel is a remarkable attraction offering great views of Osaka and its bay. Each cabin accommodates up to six people and is equipped with air conditioning, making it comfortable and pleasant for families with kids. We also, didnt experience much waiting time. The ticket price at the counter is 900 yen, which I find to be the only questionable aspect, as its not particularly budgetfriendly for families 2 adults, 3 kids for us !. It might be best to look for online discounts if available. The ride itself takes about 15 minutes. Musttry! The ride offers a stunning view of the city, including a great perspective of the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan. The experience is incredibly enjoyable, and the ticket price is quite reasonable.

They had several pieces you could view for free which I actually really liked. They currently have the exhibition of  Yoichi Umetsu Crystal Palace. The placards were also in English which really made a difference for me, it allowed to understand the artist, his intentions and motivations. The entry is only 1200 yen, 1000 yen after 5PM and that's a bargain. Recommended! Bought the amazing pass. Travelled across Osaka and got to the entrance where I learned there is a charge. Oh yes, the free part of the museum has a total of 4 pieces of art. I will include what you will see. My son who is a high school student was able to see the paid exhibition. He was not impressed. Classic bait and switch. This was really disgusting and a terrible way to treat visitors to Osaka.
Really a tremendous waste of time, both the amazing pass and this ""art museum"".

And like other people describe, there are way too many people employed here and they are directed to stand up and shadow you when you approach exhibits. I'm not sure if this is a cultural thing but it really made us very uncomfortable and destroyed any enjoyment of the museum.
I can possibly see their purpose because I saw a family of Chinese tourists and they were told to hold their little girls hand. They refused in the little girl went up to the art. It may help with such minor incidents but if someone had intention of doing harm I don't think they could stop them. Basically it was just creepy and made the place seem uncomfortable and unwelcoming.
And before anyone has something to say about me calling out Chinese tourists, well, in general they are a scourge and are very disrespectful tourists. Just search Chinese tourist reputation. Im a big fan of museums in Japan, whenever I come to Japan my biggest interest is only in art exhibitions. I have visited Osaka for many times and finally got to visit this one since they have closed for a long time

The disappointment is not about art or artist. I felt bad for smelling weird inside the building. And also, the position they put artwork made me feel like just placing it at will. Works are beautiful including the main exhibition that has ticket on sale, but its not a comfortable experience for me to look at art.
I know the lighting usually wont be too strong in museums because they want you to focus on the artwork, but this one I dont know why somehow too dark?

Hope they will improve in the future. They really have nice art but the arrangement inside is not good. Bizarre works of yoichi umetsu, surreal and organic. Seems like he worked with a group of potters and printmakers who support his work. I heard his work is inspired by plastic tree. Hard work put out to create the exhibition! This is a museum located in Nakanoshima, Osaka. As of late April 2024, there was an Aztec exhibition taking place. The exhibits are located in the basement. The restrooms prioritize appearance over functionality and are difficult to use. Additionally, my companion mentioned that there are too few toilets.","Monday: Closed

Aizenzaka,"1 Yuhigaokacho, Tennoji Ward, Osaka, 543-0075, Japan",4.0,34.656883,135.512108,"One of the slopes on the west side of Kamimachi Plateau. It is called this after the Aizendo Shotoji Temple on the slope.
It's a normal slope, not stone steps, and I don't think it's as good as Kuchinawazaka in the north or Shimizuzaka in the south. 2024.04.07
It is one of Tennoji's seven slopes, and on the top of the slope are Aizendo Shotoin and Oe Shrine.
The hill in the movie Jose, the Tiger and the Fish''
The characteristic wavy paving stones that are the model are also depicted.
Especially when the cherry blossoms at Oe Shrine are in full bloom, it becomes an even more nostalgic scene. It is a slope that can be accessed from just south of the east torii gate of Oe Shrine. It is easier to use than the stairs inside Oe Shrine. A fairly elderly woman, who must have had many years of experience using it, waddled down the stairs. I have to learn from you. Google Maps shows that it is faster to walk up the hill than to use public transportation to get to Nihonbashi or Namba from the Tennoji side.
This slope is also one of the eight slopes on the fault cliff wave cliff of Kamimachi Plateau. One area has a short history, so it is called Tennoji Nanazaka''. There are eight slopes Shingonzaka, Kiyomizuzaka, Genshojizaka, Aizenzaka, Tenjinzaka, Osaka, and Shimoderazaka.
Aizenzaka takes its name from Aizenin Temple, and has a deep literary relationship with it. The slope is right next to Oe Shrine and parallel to the stairs leading down from Oe Shrine to the west. This is a staircase called the 100yearold staircase. A slope in Yuhigaokacho, Tennoji Ward, Osaka City. The name comes from the nearby Aizendo.
This is the sacred place in the animated movie Jose, the Tiger and the Fish,'' where Josee and the main character Tsuneo meet for the first time. When you actually see the scene, it's just like the scene in the movie, making it a mustsee for fans. The origin of Aizendo's blessing is marriage, so it's perfect for the romantic movie Josee Tora. Tennoji Nanazaka are seven slopes with historical value located on the west side of Uemachi Plateau in the center of Osaka City.
Aizenzaka is located right in the middle of the seven slopes.
The name comes from Shomanin Temple, which is located at the bottom of the slope, and is said to have the power to pray for good relationships and bring luck in marriage.
The concrete ground with its jagged pattern is impressive, and at first glance it looks like a typical slope.
There are no stairs near the top exit, so bicycles can pass normally, but there was a signboard warning people to get off and pass for safety.
If you are accessing from the Matsuyamachisuji side, the landmark is the torii gate of Oe Shrine that can be seen at the end of the road. On the other hand, from the Tanimachisuji side, the landmark is a brick guidepost and a pillarshaped sign with the word ""Aizensan"" written in large letters.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The Summer Eve Festival was also held during that time in Ebisubashisuji. Boat processions with portable shrines crossed the bridges of Dohtonbori, plus energetic music and dances made the crowds feel the festive atmosphere of the place. April 8th, 2023

The view is outstanding from many of the other bridges vantage points. We just happened to be on this bridge first. You can feel the energy build up in this area as the night progresses.

The vibes are great. It's a mustsee destination while in Osaka. Neonlit structures are vibrant and breathtaking. Awesome place for shopping and getting local foods.

Shinsaibashi-Suji Shopping Street,"2-chōme-2-22 Shinsaibashisuji, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0085, Japan",4.3,34.6710169,135.5013394,"ShinsaibashiSuji Shopping Street  is one of Osakas premier shopping destinations, offering a dynamic blend of modern and traditional retail experiences. This covered arcade stretches for nearly 600 meters, making it a shoppers paradise with a wide range of stores, from luxury boutiques and global brands to local fashion and souvenir shops. Whether youre hunting for highend fashion or affordable finds, the variety here is impressive.

One of the most convenient features is the rooftop walkway that connects directly to Dotonbori, allowing you to easily explore both districts. The arcades lively atmosphere is enhanced by the abundance of cafes and restaurants, making it a perfect spot to pause for a meal or coffee during your shopping spree. Its especially fun to visit in the evening when the area is lit up, creating a vibrant ambiance. Beautiful night view with all lights making it so colorful.

Very crowded with locals and tourists. Better allocate enough time for this area if you want to do something shopping and have meals here apart from just taking some nice pictures. Pretty much have everything here.

The vibe is very touristy and if you enjoy being in the crowd, this is the perfect place . Become very crowded at night and it more lively during the night with all the light from the shoplots.

Most of the shops except for restaurant food closed pretty early,some close even before 9 pm, so plan your time wisely. As crowded as it's, I founded it incredibly fun and entertaining to walk in these streets, they felt infinite and so many nice hidden gems here and there, go early and enjoy exploring. Very busy street filled with popular brand name stores as well as smaller thrift shops. It is a great area to walk down and ""window shop"".
If you do not like crowds or busy bustling streets then this might not be for you as there will be a lot of people even later during the day.
A little shopping advice for my fellow Americans, the prices are slightly cheaper but not that significant of a difference compared to back home. However, great to come and look around. Osaka's extremely busy shopping street. Lots of shops lining the streets, as well as inside department stores like Parco and Daimaru.

You can find everything from high end shops to kitschy souvenirs and the popular pharmacies. Most of the stores do close around 8pm, and the place gets extremely busy past 5 pm with the street full of throngs of tourists.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

There's a bit of a wait but it's worth it. Cash only! They also can take a picture of you before you get on the Ferris wheel so have your phone ready. Great experience with polite and kind staff.

When we were there, there was a drum ""performance""  by some children, adding up to the atmosphere... Namba Yasaka Jinja is a small but beautiful shinto shrine in the heart of Osaka, near various metro stations  specifically the large station Namba. It has a large performance stage which is sculpted to resemble a lion head. This makes for great photos but be sure to come in the late afternoon or early morning since it does attract much foot traffic. Highly recommend coming to see what this shrine has to offer if you're ever planning to come to Osaka or are near the area. Namba Yasaka Shrine is truly a beautiful place, especially when you visit during opening hours. Unfortunately, I arrived a bit late and wasnt able to explore the shrine up close in peace. However, since Im a bit taller, I was able to take a picture over the gate, and as you can see, its a stunning shrine.

If you want to fully appreciate its beauty, I highly recommend arriving early to take your time and enjoy the serene atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit! Nice shrine in Osaka and worth a visit to marvel at the structure. I visited early morning via rental bike making it easy to get around Osaka before the crowds arrive. Its a nice spot to reflect. I recommend stopping by if you are near, renting a bike or enjoy walking around the city. This place is impressive, you really ask yourself how all of this was built, even though you read about it. But it is so impressive. It's a peaceful place, surrounded by an area so crowded.

There are some concetre terraces you can sit on but not much else. A column or obelisk is in the centre of one space. Do notice the nice murals on the wall at the entrance gate. We visited this park in November 2023. It was very nice and quiet. Since it is beside the Osaka Aquarium, nobody really visits the place. Please visit this park if you want to spend some alone time with your partner and enjoy the view of the sea and trees, especially during Autumn! This is also a great place to propose since the trees were beautiful when we were there. It's not a well organized park but also not crowded at all. Could really enjoy the peace of a sunny day Even in the midst of the summer holidays, the park was surprisingly quiet, which can be attributed to the nearby famous Osaka Aquarium and Ferris wheel that attract all the tourists. The park is appealing for those seeking a peaceful stroll among the trees, offering a nice escape from the bustling attractions. However, it's not particularly outstanding. The park is too small for joggers, and the maintenance and gardening work could use some improvement. Very nice Osaka park on the water. It has what I am told the lowest mountain in Japan and if you should want to go on a boat ride there is also the Tempozan Ferry that will take you across the river and back. Very nice way to cross the river. It is a pedestrian ferry for only people and bikes and it is also handicapped accessible  although the ramp on the other side of the river is very steep  certainly not up to code so if anyone is using a wheel chair be sure to have someone with you to provide assistance and if you do not  I would imagine that the ferry operators would be willing to assist you on the ramps.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Has 2 security guards that makes the club appears safe. 1k entrance for both men and women, 2k yen for 4 shots is pretty awesome deal! The DJ is engaging to the crowd. The dancers are pretty good! The space is not too big but you still have space to dance. The problem is people smoke shisha and cigarettes inside the club and if you are Health conscious, this is not for you.  Literally, the club will be filled with smoke and I can't tell if it's from the cigarettes or effects. Honestly.. when it comes to the main area it's like they spent all of their money on the entertainment girls and then there's no budget left for a decent DJ. However staff is friendly and prices are decent. Also the tiny room in the basement, where there's a bar, is pretty fun on the weekends. The only reason I went back. Disappointing Experience

My visit to Pure Osaka was far from satisfactory, and I would not recommend going back there.

Cleanliness and Atmosphere
 Messy and Dirty The venue was incredibly messy and dirty. It was clear that cleanliness was not a priority, with trash and spills everywhere, making it an uncomfortable place to be.
 Unpleasant Environment The overall atmosphere felt neglected and poorly maintained. This lack of care contributed to a rather unpleasant experience.

Safety Concerns
 Questionable Crowd The crowd inside also added to the feeling of insecurity. It didn't seem like a place where one could relax and have a good time without constantly watching their back. One drunk guy walked towards me and says something like someone is gonna steal my sling bag ???

Affordability
 Cheap The only redeeming quality of Pure Osaka is its affordability. Its cheap compared to other venues, but you certainly get what you pay for.
 Value for Money Even though it's inexpensive, the poor conditions and safety concerns make it hard to justify saving a few yen. Found my brother from another mother here. Im half black half Japanese, from America. Bartender is half black half Japanese but from Japan. We barely understood each other, yet the vibes were immaculate . Highly recommend if youre from out of town and looking for a place to go out! The promise was to get a free drink if I do a Google comment.

The team did not disappoint. Everyone from security to bar staff, DJ's and dancers were warm, friendly, professional and made sure you have a great night out.

I did not see any stupid people or behaviour which means security must do a great job screening who is admitted and removing anyone who becomes stupid quickly and discreetly.

Everyone was just having a great time and felt safe the whole evening.

Some reviews say the drinks are expensive, this is true comparing to a basic bar however this is a premium nightclub that needs to cover the cost of running a huge team, venue and equipment to ensure a great night out so in the context, I think the drink prices are very reasonable. They are also much cheaper than at a comparable nightclub in Australia where we come from.

We look forward to visiting again when we return next year. Full of cute Japanese girls!

Sister club with Club Kitsune Kyoto. Has a loft with many VIP tables. Right in the middle of Shinsaibashi nightlife! Easy entrance from the first floor, elevator takes you into the club. If you want to experience Japanese nightlife in Osaka this is the place!



Edited Had an event for InterNations in this club and it was fun fun fun nice club with free welcome drinks for foreigners. music is good.
smoking place inside.
this a nice club, but i want you to be aware of a couple of things
no going out of the club policy
the club is rather small, with no quiet spaces to rest for a bit
music is really loud. though clubs are expected to be loud, sometimes it was too much
toilet is for 3 people at a time maximum
smoking place is right next to the stage, so you might smell tobacco while dancing
a lot of 5star reviews are written just to get a free drink

i dont want say that i didnt enjoy my time there, though i want to be completely honest with my review. enjoy! Its an amazing place to have fun.

Drinks are amazing and just priced right. Not sure if this is a Japanese thing, but me and both of my friends were groped at this club. Literally we would hit the dance floor and the guys would make a circle around us and just stare, then get closer and closer and start touching us. It was SO uncomfortable and weird. We wanted to dance on the main floor but the guys there were way too creepy. Once we got to the ladies onlyvip section it was great. The music was amazing and the confetti was a nice touch. Just wish the guys werent so weird. Ladies, go with a guy if you can otherwise youll probably be groped too. Great music choices. The djs know how to bring the party! Definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Japan So, first time in Japan let alone Osaka, and heard about this place. Decided to check this place out on a friday night with a couple of my friends. Ended up running into a promotermanager there I believe by the name of Michael. Which was crazy, because he ended up being from the same area back in the states I was from! Due to the event going on we were able to get a free drink upon purchase of entrywhich was discounted and the party commenced. The plan was actually to only stay there for a bit, but due to the how lively everything was and to Mike's hospitality of course we ended up getting a VIP Table! Stayed there till the end pretty much. Ended up having a blast!!  Would definitely recommend this place. Locals were friendly and there were a couple of foreigners there as well perfect mix. Shoutout to the big home Mike!! Look, this place has a great vibe, but Saturday night at midnight was impossible to move around and get a drink.

Pretty good variety of drinks but none were super good. The environment was fun and we met some cool people. Go in with low expectations and prepare for a good time.  BE CAREFUL HERE  I GOT SPIKED SOMEONE DRUGGED MY DRINK.

I'm not the only person to report this, read the reviews...

Unsure if it was staff  someone in the crowd, but by 11pm I was completely fine, feeling sober, only a couple of drinks. By 1130 I had lost full awareness of surroundings, was super weak, had to be carried out. Even hospital advised I had been spiked. 3 days later I'm still recovering, and I usually can drink a lot, so I know the difference...

Luckily I had a friend to take care, others please be careful here. I went to this bar for one night.
It was nice, drinks were very fine and the music was good, it was very loud music though.
There is too much cigarette smoke thats difficult. This place is very good and very laidback! Tho it get really crowded on weekends, you'll mee lots of chill and cool people! Awesome spot. Fun and lively atmosphere. Paid a flat reasonable price for all drinks included. Didn't care much for the smoking indoors but it was worth checking out for one night!","Monday: 7:00 PM – 12:00 AM

I'm not much of a drinker or bar hopper, but we wanted to visit an LGBT bar while in Osaka and only had time for one. We spent longer than we should have reading Google reviews, reddit posts, and blogsarticles about all of the bars in Dyamach and the Namba area before we settled on Grand Slam, and we can now echo what everyone else online is saying!

It's a quaint, small bar with maybe 14 seats at the bar and two small tablebooths. I had no problem with my very limited Japanese the bartenders are a delight and the crowd is a great mix of locals and tourists. We made friends from both crowds and got coaxed into singing several songs on the karaoke system.

Super reasonably priced drinks with no attempts at upselling or pouring more than you want. In fact, the one drink I did get was a very generous portion. The owner is super, super kind and even saw us out personally when we were leaving.

I can't recommend Grand Slam enough whenever we visit Osaka again, we're definitely going back! Small but enjoyable karaoke bar. Great atmosphere. Some really awesome regulars.  Cozy, friendly, and nonsmoking bar important to us. We were immediately greeted on entering in Japanese, English, and Spanish. Very helpful and friendly staff that we talked with for a while as the bar filled up and got quite busy. Everyone enjoyed karaoke. Drink prices are very reasonable. We will be going back! Grand Slam is the go to place for hanging out after work on a weeknight or having a great time on the weekend. The bar is small, but once youre in, you dont need to move around except to get to the karaoke machine. The mama is a kind and erotic muscle man who likes to sing too. Ive never had a bad night here. Love this place! Papi and Masa were incredibly kind. The crowd and the atmosphere were friendly. As a tourist and nonJapanese speaker, I felt safe and welcomed. I'll definitely come back here when I visit Japan again.","Monday: Closed

Great sound system, great techno, I absolutely loved how dark the dance floor was. The only two things I'll complain about are the entry fee, which was three thousand yen,ouchie  the that it was a sausage party. That said, the music was great and by the time an hour or 2 had passed, it was so packed you could barely squeeze it in there. If you enjoy great atmosphere, positive energy and good music, this is the spot. If youre looking for a huge glitzy Las Vegas style club with snooty people and fake vibes, this aint it. Really good intimate nightclub. The people who go there are lovely and really bring the right vibe.  The Void soundsystem they have sounds excellent in the space.   It also didn't feel grimy or too hot like most other clubs.  Prices for soft drinks are too high though.  500 for a bottle of water is annoying. Void soundsystem, good techno music, dark, drinks are 700. Cover was 2500 but it can differ from event to event.
Great place if you're into that! ""Disappointing experience. The music felt repetitive, the atmosphere lacked energy, and the crowd seemed disengaged. The lighting was too harsh, and the drinks were overpriced. Overall, not worth the cover charge.""","Monday: Closed

GALA RESORT OSAKA Namba Nightclub,"Japan, 〒542-0084 Osaka, Chuo Ward, Souemonchō, 7−９ 東京都市開発宗右衛門町ビル",3.8,34.669362,135.5021621,"Visited the 4th floor. The music is not bad to hear but it looks like the same song is repeated and kinda dull when I stay more than an hour. I guess it'd be better to chill myselfinstead of finding fun rather than meeting new people as I did.

Not so recommended for introvert people except for music enjoyer.

However, I want to revisit this place when I visit Osaka again, but 3rd floor too. I have been here many times in the last 2 weeks and it was a great experience!

Good music, good vibes, and great service!

I would definitely recommend this place! This building is a onestop party destination! On the first floor, theres a sports bar with billiards, and upstairs, you'll find the nightclub. The club is a blast, featuring great music and a handy locker system for storing your belongings. My friend and I had a fantastic time dancing with some locals, communicating through Google Translate! It's a smokingfriendly club, complete with ashtrays on the tables. The cocktail menu was quite good, offering some excellent juices and teas as well. As one of the many foreign residents here, Gala is such a good place to be in. Its fun but I think some of the staff, including the guards and bouncers are the ones whore making a bit of discouragement to people.

I would suggest you to give them more lectures on how to treat people well, they could use their words and give clearer instructions without touching and pushing the people. Some of the bouncers are rude and thats not cool at all. If someone is getting uncontrollable then thats the time they could be more physical. I think they should be more respectful.

Besides that, Gala is fun and it would be nicer if they could give their staff some proper disciplinary lectures. Anyway, shout out to the Japanese staff at the front desk on the first floor who seems to be more mature. Hes nice and respectful. Youre handling your job well! I recently visited Osaka, a trendy bar located in the heart of Osaka. My experience was nothing short of fantastic, thanks to their excellent amenities and vibrant atmosphere.

The first thing that caught my attention was their wellmaintained billiard tables. Whether you're a novice or a seasoned player, you'll enjoy a thrilling game of billiards with friends while sipping on their delicious drinks.

Additionally, their dartboards provided endless entertainment. It was refreshing to see a bar that not only offers traditional pub games but also ensures they are in topnotch condition for patrons to enjoy.

The music selection was on point, creating a lively ambiance that added to the overall experience. From classic tunes to the latest hits, there was something for everyone to groove to.","Monday: 10:00 PM – 5:00 AM

Amazing cocktails as well since he creates new signature cocktails with every cocktail he makes. We stayed there for quite while because Roy was just amazingly friendly. You should definitely check it out if you are looking for a fun and different bar experience.   No false advertising with the name, goods time are indeed had here.

Nice sound system, excellent selection of drinks, good sized place not too big, not too small with very friendly clientele, and the bartenderowner much like the other customers, is a real pleasure to deal with.   Had such a good time I couldn't leave 'til closing.  Thank you.   Roy is so welcoming and fun to talk to. He took such good care of us. Definitely reccomend coming to this bar at the beginning of the night to get tips on where to head next. Want and awesome place to chill when in downtown Osaka. You won't go wrong drinking here.

Sound system very poor, lights poor, dance floor small. Dont waste your time going there. Good music, good dancers, very nice mood... But definitely not worth it... We had to pay 4800 for the entrance  2 drinks, which was not the price indicated on the website or at the entrance of the club 3500 . No explanation or we didn't understand because we're foreign. A bitter feeling of having been scammed... Even if we had fun, we won't come back !
Visited 191122 Its a a good club, service is good but nothing special about this club. You would find many expats there but that is about it. Dance floor is small and nothing compared to Tokyo clubs. My thought on this club. First the good. Visually its the best club in Osaka I have seen. Nice. Professional staff. Good looking clientele. Easy access to the bar. Overall setup is nice.

The bad. its pricey at 3000 yen for male wirh one drink ticketwhatever. My main problem was the mediocre DJ and sub par sound system. All the sound seems to be coming from 2 speakers. Hip hop was the main genre and not many people dancing. kinda crappy.

I would return to give another shot but was slightly disappointed. 16th of August from 2200500 will be doing Latin Party!! music and is Latin and Brazil Funk!!
for guest discount say Osaka Latin Crew at the entrance 2000 with 1drink  1000 with 1drink. For more info please follow us on Instagram osakalatincrew

The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the music was amazing. If you're visiting from out of town and want to experience a great club, this is a mustvisit spot! The only drawback of the place was the strong smell of smoke. Plays hip hop travisdrake etc and very lively with a good mix of foreigners too. Best club in Osaka in my opinion. Small entry fee 500, and drinks are reasonable. We went on a Thursday around 11 PM
500 yen each for entry.
We were the only customers.
Music 5 stars as I like hip hop and RB.
But difficult to dance to around 11 PM when the place is empty.
It became busier around 1230 PM and atmosphere was great as more people are dancing.
800 yen for a glass of beer and 500 yen for soft drink, 300 yen for mineral water.
I would come back on a weekend around 1AM, if I were younger 
No energy to party after 1 AM 
All clubs in Japan people can smoke so thats one start less . Seems like a good place and reasonable drink prices for a club however we got in at midnight on a Saturday for 500 but it was not busy. Additionally the music was alright very TikTok like if you get what I mean. On the good note the staff was very nice and the bouncers where friendly","Monday: Closed

The drinks were great, and they were all around 1000 yen. I bought about 89 drinks and a round of shots, and the total bill was only 11000 yen. Theres a massive amount of songs to choose from to sing karaoke, and its very easy to cue up as you select them yourself from a portable tablet. Absolutely nobody cares about your talent level here and will applaud at the end of your song, so even if youre not confident in your voice this is a fun experience. If you like to socialize and sing, this is the place to be. Amazing bar, we had a lot of fun singing the karaoke and even the staff was singing with us. Great evening thanks to that bar! Unexpected nice, really recommended! Prices are fine too. Not too cheap but its a bar after all! Quite literally the greatest bar I've ever been to. Was solo travelling from Australia so didn't know anyone at the bar but I really wanted to sing. The vibes and atmosphere were unmatched. The bartenders made me feel at home and the people were great. Soon enough I made some new friends.

The karaoke is was really sets this bar apart. Don't be afraid to sing, you might just meet some people with the same passion and soul for music. Everyone is there to have fun so don't be afraid to let loose and belt out your favourite song.

One of the greatest nights ever. Billy Joel's piano man is always a good song to sing. Too bad I had a flight back to Australia the next day otherwise you might just spend the entire night at your place!

Highly recommended if you're in Osaka. The Drunken Clam is a must visit bar while in Osaka, the staff is top notch and were very kind and welcoming during my time in the area!

If you get a chance to talk with the owner or any of the bartenders there they are wonderful people and will make sure you enjoy yourself in Dotombori

This is a must stop if you like Karaoke, there is no cover charge, or karaoke charge, it is open mic style so other patrons normally join in to the songs making for very fun and friendly nights

International exchange here is also great! Lots of english speakers come here which can help if youre not comfortable with Japanese but still want to learn more about the area and night life

Highly recommend going around 930pm  1000pm on Fridays and Saturdays to meet more locals in the area who go out for the weekend! Tucked away up a tiny stairwell so look for the sign on the street or above the doorway. Small venue that wasn't too busy, BUT, drinks are watered down or very weak and on the pricey side. Good place to say you went to, with great staff and public Karaoke. Not much Family Guy reference other than some pictures on the wall and figurines. Worth a short visit for a laugh.","Monday: 8:00 PM – 2:00 AM

We were waiting for our cab on the street . Security guard  kept pushing us away from our pick up spot . Then choked our female friends neck !! She literally almost passed out ! So Brutal ! And told us they own the block Overall my experience was really bad.
The music was kinda meh, a little bit overpriced and the management of this club is a disaster.
Around 1A.M it gets really crowded and, basically they let anyone in. There were a few times when I thought there would be a man crush! The worst part were the security guards. If you try to take a rest at the side of the dance floor Basically because you can not dance they force you back there! They were completely rude and careless that I would be not surpised is someday something bad happens Probably not the best club, there are better clubs out there. Its mostly full of very young kids trying to mess around. They often lack manners. There are some foreigners and also some creepy and weirdo men, both foreign and Japanese.

However this club seems to be the most crowded these days. Especially at Saturday night which can get too crowded. If you go on the other days, its probably fine unless its a day before holiday. Was discriminated by the club.
First, they took cover charges from girls from our group despite girls were supposed to enter for free for young Japanese girls. I spoke with a local Japanese girl that frequents clubs in Osaka and confirmed that was discrimination.
Second, girls were suppose to drink for free. There was a Girl's All You Can Drink Menu written in Japanese at the bar. Despite not being Japanese, I do understand Japanese. I asked the bartender if I can get the AYCD menu because I am a girl in Japanese. They refuse to honor that and lied to me that it's only for Birthday Girls. Our group happened to have a birthday girl but they also didn't honor that and said her birthday was before midnight.

Foreigners, avoid this club at all costs! They do not welcome foreigners at all... This is not a club for foreigners. Way too crowded, can't really dance freely, good luck trying to reach the smoking zone after 1am its packed as hell... Guys are being treated like trash by the security. Music was good, the dancers and the lights were nice but it was way too crowded to enjoy it for real...","Monday: 10:00 PM – 5:00 AM

Very ""foreigner friendly"",  a good spot if you're just trying to meet and talk to fellow tourists or just jam out!. I enjoyed the Moonshine cocktail a delicious spiced apple cider type but a wide selection of finer whiskeys and liquors for those interested was available. Joshua was super friendly and seemed to be having just as good a time! My absolute favourite bar in Osaka.

This bar is a must visit if you are interested in some casual karaoke and meeting people from all over the world.

It is very foreignerfriendly and the overall vibe is very welcoming.

The bar has around 8 seats and I believe around 2 standing tables out front, which makes it very cozy and easy to talk to people.

The karaoke is free to use for however long you want after ordering a drink and there is a great happy hour with 500 tap beer available from 1900  2100 I believe.

Overall it is a must visit when visiting Osaka and you are guaranteed to have fun and meet great people there. Small little bar that has a cool chill vibe! My karaoke chops are not good though lol. Owner is definitely cool and I hope to come by there again the next time I'm in Osaka. Visiting from the US, and stopped by the Moonshine Karaoke bar to pregame the night. It was a blast! The bar is super small, but creates an intimate  friendly setting. Song selection is both English  Japanese, so there is something for everyone. We ended up making friends with a travel group with ppl visiting from Australia  UK. Its a cute venue, and there is literally no need to be shy! Grab a drink, grab a mic  have a great time! Cheers!!

The host was a dude who gave us great spots to hit while in Osaka  also while in Thailand our next destination on this trip I've been coming to this bar since around 2017 whenever I come to Osaka. I've always had fun. And today has been no different. Maasa and Alyssa are super nice.

I paid 2500 yen for the entrance, but the service is really poor. They let me in for 2000 yen, gave me a tiny lil half shot of jager, and a drink ticket that i used for a vodka redbull.

Very unique tastes and flavors and even an Osaka version of a drink Bisco Sour that highlights a famous local cookie.   There is an extensive offering of whiskies for those that like.  Apparently some very limited bourbon is also available.

Was tricky to find with a dark hidden door next to Cool Beyond thats easy to miss in evening, but it is on the Main Street right next to it.

Highly recommend! One of the few cocktail bars that you MUST visit when in Osaka. Great selections of drink with great knowledgeable staff along with a great vibe. From what I saw on the menu it seems like they do make non alcoholic drinks so even if you dont drink alcohol you can still drink and have a good relaxing time. Very cool Osaka speakeasy bar experience.  Nice place to chill and te try different cocktails. Friendly bartenders that speak English. Highly recommend if you want picture worthy drinks that taste as good as they look. The ambience  drinks was 
It has a rule of 1 drink per hour, so you need to drink quickly. Its perfect for a quick drink, but not suitable for slow drinkers or those wanting to catch up with friends for a long conversation This place is a hidden gem. Unique in atmosphere and impeccable service from staff. Cocktails are sublime, and each stylistically beautiful. Would recommend the Bonnie and Clyde as an elevated espresso martini and the Mr Hendricks was absolutely exquisite.","Monday: 6:00 PM – 1:00 AM

Pita is the best!!! Thank you for the great time
I will definitely come again on my next trip Honestly, it's really fun, and both the people and staff are incredibly welcoming. There's a nice mix of nationalities there. I'd definitely recommend it if you want to dance on afro beats without breaking the bank. Super great bar! It always feels like family when we come through! The drinks are good! The music is great! They play a mix of reggae, hip hop and rap! They have darts and other games. I love this bar. Me and my boyfriend go every week. Visit if you have the chance to in Osaka","Monday: Closed

Very small cover charge but the drink is good and the owner is cool and speak a little bit of english. Definitely a place to check out. A very unique experience. With a very friendly staff behind the bar. It might seem a little sketchy at first but then you're welcomed by room of lights and and tubes that are lit up giving a psychedelic experience while also drinking a very nice cocktail. Such a cool bar, at first its pitch black when you enter do not be intimidated. As you buy some drinks the bartender turns on the neon lights, and the experience begins. The atmosphere was awesome and talking to the bartender was a great experience. Honestly this was one of the biggest highlights of my trip coming here, I highly recommend. First time I stepped in, I was little scared because of darkness. But it's worth it if you are looking for relaxing space. Yes, it's somehow relaxing despite of bar name and darkness. The seat charge is 3bucks, pretty cheap for normal Japanese bar. There's no menu. Drinks are little bit pricy but worth it. It can feel odd walking in if the lights are off, but once youre there the owner is very nice and makes some interesting cocktails. He also makes an effort to make conversation in English and has good recommendations for sightseeing. This is one of the most unique bars in Japan and if youre looking for that Burning Man vibe, youll find it here.","Monday: 12:00 – 6:00 AM, 8:00 PM – 12:00 AM

I cant recommend it enough. Its a place where youll make new friends and by the time you look up four hours have passed by. Truly one of a kind place. Highly recommend for anyone coming to Japan not to OSAKA! Its not even the drinks itself that are good,  which they are! but its the owner deuce that makes it such a chill vibe and really makes an effort to really get to know you! I I can see why its flourishing so much and Im assuming itll be 10 times as big in no time! If theres any reason to come in Japan, it would be this bar. This is a great little funky basement bar right in the Dotonbori area.  There is an excellent selection of specialty cocktails, as well as more conventional drinks, draft beer, etc.  All four specialty cocktails that we tried were really good.  The space itself is fantastic, aesthetically speaking, with interesting art at every turn.  The staff was super friendly and helpful as well.  A DJ was just setting up as we were leaving so we didn't experience that, but the music that was being played the whole time we were there was great. Cool basement bar in Dotonbori. Very reasonable prices, and compared to other bars we had tried the drinks sizes were fair. Some bars in Osaka serve smaller drinks for these prices. Good cocktails and nice positive attitude with the service. The atmosphere is nice and its easy to meet new friends at the bar. No service charge and definitely foreigner friendly. Good cocktail list and some interesting house specials. Definitely worth a visit. Awesome cocktail bar along Dotonburi! Deuce and his team do an incredible job on taste, presentation and vibe. They'll even do an Omakase style drink where you tell them what you like and they'll make up a drink for you. Highly recommend visiting here if you're in Osaka, you will not regret it. My go to bar in Osaka. Known Deuce for nearly a decade. Deuce and his staff make one of the best cocktails including his feature of the old classic old fashion into his own intake of it called the Shinsekaithe new world. The vibe is super chill and this place is really nice. Both for the locals and for tourist. If your ever in the area I highly recommend going here and you will not be disappointed. Not only is he a local expat in Osaka he knows other great spots ShinsaibashiAmemura and other parts of the fun Dotonbori. Ask him about why he's so passionate about his goals and so forth. You will never meet such a kind and open dude ever in Japan. My favorite go to drink was the bye bye birdie, but honestly if he's not too busy ask him for a custom cocktail and it will blow your minds out of your chair!","Monday: 7:00 PM – 1:00 AM

The beauty of this place is that you dont need to study the menujust share your preferences, and let the talented staff craft a drink that suits you perfectly. As someone who doesnt drink alcohol, I was thrilled by the care and creativity they put into their mocktails. Ive never had anything quite as delicate and refined before Really!.

Id recommend this bar to everyone, regardless of whether you drink alcohol or not. The only downside is that it gets quite crowded later in the night, but the service remains impeccable. The waitstaff handled everything with ease, ensuring we were well taken care of. Ill definitely be coming back, though I might aim to arrive a bit earlier next time to enjoy the experience without the crowd. The speakeasy lives up to the reviews! The bartenders were all so welcoming, had one of my favourite cocktails ever! Certainly wont the visit! It does get quite busy, so best to get there early! This speakeasy is on the 5th floor! Just take the elevator up and you should be there. There is a sign outside the door that you should be careful not to break their expensive glass or you would be charged!

It's relatively small and you have to dunk to get through a small door. We sat at the bar and the bartenders knew English. It seems like most of the customers were tourists.

We asked for their signature drinks and tried them. One was coffee flavored and the other is their version of an old fashion. They were both very good and surprisingly strong! 4 of us got 2 drinks each 14,000 yen total, VERY reasonable based only on our personal tastes they made drinks that blew us all away. We struggled to even leave because the ambience and drink were so good. They do nothing fast so don't be in a rush. Also no clinking glassware since it's so delcate and expect someone to be smoking cuz it's not banned here. They speak English, it's mostly foreigners maybe because great cocktails aren't a big thing in Japan?. Would 100 come back repeatedly if I could. This is such a cool place. The bartenders are very welcoming and friendly. You just have to tell them the flavour profile or alcohol base you want and they will create you something based on that. I mentioned I liked the Japanese plum wine and they made a cocktail just like it, maybe better. Another time I said something spicy, with no other restrictions and it was one of the best spicy drinks I've had to date. Will be back if we can!","Monday: 5:00 PM – 3:00 AM

Sound system is absolutely horrible, and the price 2500Y is a complete ripoff. I'm not sure what these other reviewers are talking about, but their sound system is absolutely awful, coming from a soundstage professional working on major projects Coachella, Lightning in a Bottle, Burning Man, etc. for over 20 years.

Couldn't tell you the guygirl ratio at this music bar cause I got too drunk.
Great all you can drink venue tho.  Wrist bands let you go to family Mart for smokes and a famichiki and come back to keep drinking. It's a pretty nice club. Say Ghost for discounted price.

G2 is a good place to keep the party going a bit longer since most clubs close at 45am and G2 is open until 8am. Its not as good as your major clubs like Bambi but you cant expect too too much from a club like this at 58am. Nice place to have an after, open from 5am. The traditional night is you start at the giraffe at 10, then go the G3 until 5 then to the G2 from 5 and you have to pay only 1 time for all of these clubs and you can use your free Fri is in each one of them. Many people, mostly Japanese, 5050 girls and guys. The only bad point is the music. It's the same in all of these 3 clubs EDM.... One security guard in particular by the name of Musashi ruined the night. Very unprofessional and appeared to come to work looking for a fight. He had an altercation with my friend. Instead of appropriately retraining my friend, he pushed him down the stair and held him on the ground and punched him. We took our friend outside and was about 200m away speaking to another guard about retrieving some of stuff from the lockers and being polite and respectful. Musashi decided to walk out and approached us outside again just to fight my friend. Instead of doing his job and protecting the people inside or the club. My prospective is that he was very unprofessional, use of unreasonable force to restrain my friend appropriately, and trying to fight my friend outside even though we left the premise. this club is a good place, super crowed at 4am or 5am. I'm only giving 1 star because this member of security Musashi. I don't like to name and shame but this was my experience in g2. A bit small and confusing layout with little dance space, but great place to head to towards the early morning when everything else is closing down. Mostly a young college crowd.

If you need a good night out then go for it Ryan and Lena is such a great tour guide. They have something going on here. I highly recommend it if your going to Osaka. Drinks are free and the crowd is very sociable  I had the greatest time. So happy I joined. Ryan and Lena were amazing! I love Leva so much!! Highly recommend. Ryan, Tommy and Brandon were absolutely amazing tonight and I have a lot of fun with them. Definitely a bar trip to do if u want to hang out in Osaka !","Monday: Closed

Turns out they have a happy hour before 7PM that all drinks are 100 off. I got myself a pia colada and it was perfect. They have a pool table here and I would like to go visit again A very nice little bar, great food, good people and a really great place to relax, have some good food and drinks. An awesome band plays really good music on the weekends. Staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. The bar food menu choices are great and have a lot to choose from and prepared well. Will visit again for sure. Spent 3.5 hours there, and it felt like an hour. Also if you fancy playing pool, they got that as well, but be prepared to be good at it though Amazing place in Osaka!
If you want to go some where you feel welcome when you miss home a little check this place out! Great cold beer with a good selection and good food !
Staff are awesome and look for Kevin great guy makes you feel like long time friend! And shout to Jesse and Allen! Everyone working in the bar is really nice. Karen is really cool, friendly and fun! She always remembers my favorite drink I love herrrrrr!
Good place to go with friends or even alone. Youll meet many Japanese and international people. The atmosphere is always amazing and sometimes they have live music. Excellent atmosphere, drinks, and food! Even I just like coming here to have dinner. I've tried the fish and chips, pizza, and calamari, and they were all excellent.

I like to get the apple cider. And they have imported drinks on tap at good prices. Owner and staff are all really cool.

I went here many times when I was in Osaka. I will come again when I return to the city!","Monday: 5:00 PM – 1:00 AM

The bar is small but the atmosphere is really nice. The drinks are a bit sweet for my taste but they have really funny names. The person at the bar speaks english and he is really friendly. You can play old videogames while having a drink and chill. Super fun experience Fun bar! Drinks are really cheap 800 yen each and delicious and theres loads of retro games to play. Would 100 recommend. A brilliant fun and foreigner friendly bar with so many retro video games and all for free! All the crew spoke English and were enthusiastic to chat and get people involved with games.

A very long list of unique game based cocktails and draft beer makes it a brilliant late night spot. Not tons of space so on busy nights prepare to hover for a bit, but plenty of multiplayer games to choose from to help break the ice in the city! Fun tiny bar with welcoming staff and a bunch of retro consolesgames.

We planned on passing by for a quick drink but got stuck in there having fun playing games until they closed.

Its a pretty small space so consider the timing of your visit if you prefer sitting down.

Even if you are not able to grab a seat, there is a dedicated space for you to play some consoles standing up which was also fun.

Dont expect premium alcohol. Im a massive retro gamer and this place felt like it would tick all the boxes. However, the guy working behind the bar was the most unhelpful barman ever. Far more interested in flirting with a couple of the single travellers than helping other customers. Games are free and the beer is beer. I wouldnt go back after this which is a real shame.","Monday: 5:00 PM – 2:00 AM

It has been operating since 1933 as the grand cabaret lounge in Minami Namba, Osaka.

A while back, I was at a preview screening of a certain drama on cable TV? I went with something like that.
It seems that this kind of box is also used for events, but the usual business is cabaret  There are no cabarets in Tokyo anymore, so this is a valuable Showa heritage. A veteran hostess will take care of you

You can enjoy it at a reasonable price.
It's like traveling back in time to the Showa bubble era.

Was a very welcoming place reason for me not rating the food is that I basically didn't eat much smoking is only at the entrance, so shouldn't be a big problem for those who dislike cigarettes, and still available for those who smoke so you don't have to go all the way out to the street. I couldnt get the normal enjoyment plan for two shows but the VIP ticket was available so I booked it. When the bill came the extra 2000 per pax table charge applied for each show. I thought its 2000 per pax for both shows. And on top of that there is an additional 25 surcharge for VIP seats. Ended paying 30k plus instead of 20k plus for 2 pax. I went for both shows because I read reviews that each show is different. Yes they are. But its the same girls doing different dance items so they are similar. My advice is go book for one show and then decide if you want to stay for another show. It may be more expensive but at least you know what you are getting before committing. Wow, this place is a party!
The girls are very cool and friendly. They made us Americans feel very welcome too!

The dancing was incredible and so was the music. The singing was seriously awesome! One of the girls was like a rock star, her voice was 1010. I'm definitely coming back next time I'm in Osaka! Before the show I was not sure if the show was worth the money. I don't want to spoil anything, but I was laughing the entire time. It was the ultimate blend of really hot girls and quirky japanese segments. 10 out of 10. I've been to Tokyo Burlesque several times, so I visited Osaka Burlesque wondering what kind of level of business it was in.
There were many attractive dancers and the atmosphere was great, so I had a lot of fun.

Its SO COLORFUL even from the outside! Came in as a group and it was pretty busy Friday night. Flashy and splashes of color everywhere inside. The cute cat boy bartender was awesome! Made us feel so welcome that we ended up staying longer. Definitely worth a visit in your nighttime travels! This is a very nice, tiny, quirky kitschy bar with a very good range of alcohol.  As with with all the other bars in this area, the booze is pricey because the place is small and therefore profit margins are relatively small.
I arrived very early in the evening, so the place was empty I paid Y1000 for a small beer.
Mine Australian Host was friendly  knowledgeable, having lived here for 30 years.
I introduced myself on departure. He informed me that We dont tend to exchange names here or words to that effect. The adorable, resident little rather vociferous dog, however, does allow the use of his name. Unfortunately, I cannot recall what it is Visited twice during a trip to Osaka.  Received a warm welcome from the owner Sully and his assistant bartender Amos the daschund.  Decor is wild with plenty going on to keep you interested, the theme even extends into the toilet!

Wide range of spirits available as well as beers and Saki. No cover charge and prices are reasonable.

Met a number of other tourists there during both visits and Sully was a wonderful host, encouraging conversation between solo travellers, locals and groups visiting.

Music can be whatever you want it to be as they will take requests and Karaoke was a hit with the locals.

Definitely stop by and support this bar during your visit to Osaka. No cover charge though the individual price for the beer we had was a bit steep. Had a really nice conversation with both staff members available on the day! Just a very chill vibe despite both of us not really matching the demographic of the other people there. Great Place to Enjoy in Doyama!

Ive always started my Doyama party nights here and have sometimes ended up back here later on.

Not sure about the few 1star reviews but they seem to be from people who dont understand that people in Japan carry around their own trash until they get home or stumble on a proper place to dispose of it as opposed to walking into a tiny bar and shoving your trash into the owners face so that deserves 1star.

Or people who do NOT drink in tiny Japanese bars with cover charges and more expensive prices because thats the way it is in Japan.  You dont get charged a cover here but the drinks are very similar to other places so those 1star complaints are meaningless.  Probably the 711 tourists who only eat and drink convenience store products.

I have done nighttime bar tours for years in Kyoto and sometimes added a night with cool clients to meet up in Osaka after their time in Kyoto and 100 of them had fun here.

Id say if anything, this bar is cluttered like my moms house with every decoration she has ever bought.  Im a crazy neatfreak and this bar is far, far, far from anything filthy.  Its a bar!?  And guys stand up in the toilet.  If you see some splatter at 1 a.m. its not the owners fault.  Its so dark in there so Im not sure if these complainers are sporting white gloves and running them across the tops of shelves or across countertops because its not filthy.  Its funny that these same people complaining will walk into the most disgusting, disheveled pigsty of a bar in Kyto and think its the most unique and adorable place if a Japanese man who is the same age as the owner of this place and think they have hit this amazing cultural exchange experience and never think twice when there are cockroaches on the walls.  There are MANY cool bars with cockroaches in Japan. I see them on my tours.

It used to get very smoky in this bar but that happens in EVERY tiny bar.

Dont listen to the 1star review people.

I dont even know the owners name.  He recognizes my face but Im usually there months later and not really a regular customer so Im not being asked to say all of this.

I have former clients going to Osaka and two friends from Madrid, Spain heading there this month and wanted to forward the name and location to them and saw the ignorant reviews.

I 100 agree with one of the 1star review people who said Grand Slam is fun and welcoming.  Thats my second stop after this place on an Osaka party night.  Both bars are great.

Is it Denny?  Danny?  Now thats going to bother me.  I should know his name after 9 years in Kyto.  lol","Monday: 7:00 PM – 2:00 AM

It was on my bucket list of todos while in Japan. Music selection was pristine, and the speakers  surrounding atmosphere really entranced us. The bartenderDJ must also maintain the vibe and high quality experience of the sound, and that may mean not allowing certain people in, even if it isnt full. Its a small, but intentional, space. We were very grateful to be permitted entry as obvious tourists. Great cocktails  a wonderful night that we wont forget. By far the most unique experiences Ive had in Japans bar scene. People keep saying its the vinyl records, but actually its the quality of the speakers that takes you back in time. Absolutely must visit while in Osaka. dont be surprised if the Bartender whos also the d.j and the bouncer denies your entrance. I watched him for the entire night trying to figure out why he rejected more than 80 of walkins  couldnt figure it out. I guess its his show. Might be the best bar in Osaka if you want to chill and listen to music. The owner is a real artist in his music selection and skills to make cocktails. Its really small and intimate which makes it even more special. He has a huge collection of vinyls, mainly jazz I would guess. Its giving 90s Japanese Bar and we loved it! Never gonna forget this one Intimate music bar with a fine audio system and huge LP collection, style much like a classic jazz kissa ... but was all about Jack Johnson on our visit! For a actual jazz hit the nearby Bar Nakumara, which is also cheaper and friendlier. This bar is small and very cozy. It had great music, and the prices were reasonable. I recommend going, but for groups of no more than three people.","Monday: 7:00 PM – 1:00 AM

My buddy and I came across this bar while looking online and boy we werent disappointed. We planned to go bar hopping but we ended up going back 3 night in a row and each time we made new friends. It had an amazing atmosphere with Richard hyping up the crowd and Chris providing vocals if you cant hit the notes. Dont be afraid to sing a song because the whole bar will join you! The drinks are cheap and its a good place to chill and also meet new people. Recommend to come here if youre in Osaka alone or in a group. Ill definitely be back when I visit Osaka again thank you Chris and Richard for your hospitality.  Izzy Richards created a special spot here that I will be coming back to every time Im in Osaka. Amazing vibes, great drinks at great prices, always meet great people there I went twice while in Osaka for the week. There is also no charge fee or fee for the karaoke, he really has just made a place you can go to for a guaranteed good time. Cheers Richard  One of my favorite places in Osaka. Amazing little place to wind down the night... or maybe wind it up if you're a night owl. ""Friendly"" doesn't do the staff and owner justice, so do yourself a favor and add it to your must visit list. It was such a special experience. We had a great night at the Kama Sutra Karaoke Bar.

I opted to sit at the counter seat for extra, and it was totally worth it. I was too early for the show, but the casual tricks they were doing were great. Instagramworthy cocktails and they cater to aesthetic, as well as noticing when you are taking pictures of the cocktail theyre making. Theyll move whatever is in the way so you can get a good photo which is super nice and much appreciated, especially since it wasnt even my drink! I wouldve stayed for more drinks, but this was the second cocktail bar I visited and I didnt want to get too drunk by myself. The hostess was so friendly as well, by walking with me out of the bar and calling the elevator and I appreciated her kindness and hospitality. If youre in Osaka you have GOT to come to this place. The staff are just phenomenally friendly, attentive and all round brilliant. Honestly the best display of service Ive ever seen, and we went to universal yesterday . The cocktails were out of this world and, as the name suggests, they have a library of spirits that they make IN HOUSE! At the weekend they even have a cocktail show at the bar. Honestly, just come! AMAZING!! Amazing cocktails made with an entertaining flourish. Sit at the bar if you can to watch the making. Highly recommend the Lemon Tart cocktail. The service was top notch and the drinks were really good too! Everything on the menu was so pretty and delicious! Every drink was really good and its nice place to get away from the hustle and bustle. Must go on Osaka! Cant go wrong with this place!

Also lost my phone that night and I was able to retrieve it the next day when they opened. I felt safe and it was a fun memory . never come to this bar. I have been to many bars and clubs in Osaka but this is the most worst bar ever, all the staff are thieves,  especially when you drop your wallet or something here, they will take it and pretend they don't know.. Should be renamed hell. Rampant with thieves, drink spikers, and bouncers that are completely unaware and sometimes complicit in the nefariousness. Avoid this late night club if you value your dignity and health. Be very careful of this place. Fun bar when you're wasted, however theft is rampant. I lost an item last Friday night after leaving it in a corner for a few minutes.

Owner was not overly helpful when I asked about my stolen items and returned the next day. I'm not sure I would go again. First time having anything stolen in Japan. Be careful is all I will say, do not leave anything out in the open and do not take anything valuable here whatsoever. Open late but dangerous place.  Thieves steal from bags.  Staff will take your full drink from the table if you don't watch carefully.  Many fights so many security staff.  Dirty toilet, vomiting.

I found out about the ROR Comedy Club while searching for things to do in Osaka. We rocked up to the venue a little too early but were greeted with a cool little bar with cheap cocktails, so we were set. The guys eventually welcomed us down stairs to an intimate little setting where the comedy took place. A mixed group of audience members from all around the world sat eagerly wondering what we had in store. We were not disappointed and experienced a great night of comedy that had us all laughing. Definitely recommend this to English speaking travelers who are looking for something more mainstream to do in Osaka at night.
Thanks for a great memorable night. We will be sure to attend again next time we are in Osaka. Fun nighttime activity to do in Osaka if you dont drink. Plan to come early because its at dinner time but afterwards you can explore Dotonburi since its conveniently located next to it. I wish there were more Japanese comedians that were born in Japan. Most of the people have lived in Japan for a significant amount of time. Not as vulgar as New York City, which is nice. Highly recommend. Comedians performed in English. Had an amazing time here during my first night in Osaka. The acts had me laughing so hard I was tearing.

Some things to note
Cost was very fair.
Drinks were great.
The venue was very cozy, allowing a lot of opportunities to engage with the audience. Definitely recommend! Had a great time. Saw 4 comedian and they were all good and friendly, the place is not too big so there's interaction between everyone creating a nice vibe.
Good place to spend your evening if you have no plans in Osaka. Very intimate show, but loved it! Literally and figuratively underground, good fun, great atmosphere, good English, great discovery in Osaka. And food  drinks that taste good and are easy on the budget.","Monday: 7:45 – 10:00 PM

The first time I went it was absolutely amazing! I had so much fun dancing with other people. The music was great as well as the lights. I loved seeing the pole dancers! The second time I went there was hardly anyone a Saturday night so no atmosphere. The drinks here are pretty good. The staff is incredibly friendly. A good place to go if you can speak English and no Japanese. This place is recommended by a lot of folks in Osaka. I hope to comeback again and with any luck on a busy night Over 50's club including the djs, and too many guys and a few burnt out singles. Some nice pole dancing but do not go for the music. Entrance seems a bit pricey for what you're getting. You'd be better off visiting one of the trendy clubs in the vicinity. It's one of the better nightclubs I've been to in Osaka. While the venue isn't huge there's a huge dance floor and decently priced drinks. I recommend that you go here on a Friday or Saturday since it's fairly empty the rest of the week compared to other places. Staff were helpful and gladly assisted in showing me how the lockers near the entrance worked. I would say the experience was just ok... It's a bit of a grimey bar with many foreigners, prawling around trying to hit on girls... Two pole bars with heavily tattooed bikini clad girls twirling around. Not a big club, yet still pretty busy at 23 am. Most drinks 700 yen which i think is reasonable. Music was mainstream pop made electro so usually good to dance to and sing along. Probably would not go again though, from my first impression Osaka has better places to go. Sam and Dave used to be the club where people used to enjoy all different kinds of music on the same night.  And now most of the djs on big nights are playing only dark hip hop.  The management needs to bring back the original Sam and Dave style international party",no operation time,"night_club, point_of_interest, establishment"

When there were two Japanese girls came, the boss moved there and left me there. This place is definitely not friendly for foreigners. Very friendly place, handsome owner and welcoming to foreigners. I ended up singing karaoke with everyone at the bar until 2 am. What a fun night with really nice people. Very nice drinks!! Friendly boss and nice staff I had an amazing experience at this bar. The host is very friendly and handsome, drinks are very good too. I speak no Japanese and had no problems because the host speaks very good English. I would totally recommend this place and will make sure to visit if I happen to be back in Osaka. The staff is super friendly and the owner speaks English and Japanese so that helps!

The owner Roy is also great company, speaks English and Japanese, and was able to give us some insights on our travels around Osaka. My cocktail was also delicious  left it to the expert Roy. Thanks for a great evening in Osaka! Abare is a hidden gem in the middle of hundreds of bars. Great atmosphere and excellent service. Prices that cant be beat. Shisha and chill. Out of all the hookah lounges in Japan this was one of our favorite. Cant wait to go back in a few months. The owner is verify friendly and speaks fluent English. Definitely a must if you are visiting Osaka. Also they have a full bar and gaming console to chill and relax. I wish every hookah place in Japan was like this place.

The drinks and hookah were amazing and service is top notch. Hidden bar is a surprise. Owner was very friendly and very good at doing cocktails. Ask him what you'd like to drink and he'll make it for you. Good selections of shisha as well. Few table games available. We really enjoyed it!","Monday: 10:00 PM – 5:00 AM

The atmosphere was incredibly cozy, with a welcoming vibe that made me feel right at home. The bar keep was very friendly and even allowed me to sample some of the craft beers before making my choice. I ended up ordering a couple of Baird IPAs, which were fantastic  fruity and refreshing.

The pub also offers a comfortable area where you can enjoy your drinks, play billiards, and watch various sports games on wide screens. The nachos I ordered were delicious, generously topped with cheese and very filling.

One unique aspect of Blarney Stone is that it allows smoking inside, which is rare in Osaka and particularly near Dtonbori. This feature might not be for everyone, but it certainly adds to the pub's distinctive character.

The menu is extensive, featuring a wide selection of beers, whiskeys, hard drinks, and even cocktails. Overall, Blarney Stone Irish Pub is a fantastic spot to unwind, enjoy great drinks, and have a good time. Highly recommended! Went here around the end of September on a Friday night. It was a lovely bar with pool table and theres a sport game on the TV. Great services and good drinks! I love their pia colada! A great place for a pint, good food and good times.

Located on the 6th floor elevator is on the 2nd floor

The staff here are super cool  friendly and outgoing. Very knowledgeable about beers 

On weekends they have live music  and English club on Wednesdays.

Fun for everyone. Ill definitely be back here again soon!!

Enjoy  Went there for one drink but ended up staying for more. The drinks, the kindness of the people, and the live band were on point. Cheers I came across this pub in Umeda looked interesting, but was disappointed with the management and some of the male staff. They were rude and passive aggressive the managers also were no help when I asked for help and were extremely rude. It made me think how are these incompetent people running a restaurant. Aside from that I waited a long time for my foodabout 1 hour. Honestly had a horrible experience. For the price you can definitely find better places and I don't recommend this place to anyone. If you are looking to come here I would advice you to go somewhere you will have a HORRIBLE experience.","Monday: 5:00 PM – 1:00 AM

The cocktails don't seem any stronger either. Stick to the beer and you'll be alright. Always know what youre getting at moon walk. An Osaka based chain which also has a couple of branches in Tokyo. Drinks are decent, creative, and good value. Food isnt bad either. Great as somewhere to go as your second or third destination of the night, or later as its open until 5am. Such a scam.

They accept only upfront cash as payment. They have Happy hours before 8pm selected drinks at 400yen, however these selected drinks originally range from 500600, so dont expect too much. The Bar is accessible through an Elevator next to a parking lot where usually some people smoke next to the entrance and look slightly annoyed when you try to pass them.

Dont worry, as soon as they realize that you are trying to enter the bar they ease up.

The bar is a quite big and is buzzing. As the name suggests the bar offers possibilities to play Billard. You can write your name on a whiteboard and enter a challenge. On one of the tables you can play against other players Winner can continue to play at that table loser has to make room for the next contender.

If youre not into Billard there is also many other activities table tennis, table football, darts and many other things.

Food was good and Service and Drinks were great!
Everything was reasonable priced!

If you have an acquaintance that smokes its possible to smoke inside Very bad service, rented a pingpong table for 30 min, after 20 min they were taken by the staff after i went to the toilet. When i came to ask tham back got yelled at to leave somewhere else, 2 bartenders came to me standing very close started pushing me like they wanted to start a fist fight A great stop to watch sports, play darts or pool while having a drink. The music is decent too.
 Although it's a sports bar they don't show football or soccer games Fun place to hangout and have a few drinks.
They have billiards and darts! Also a few games, I think.

Cheers from your German friends! It's difficult to put a so so review because the service is profoundly awesome and the food is good, not the best, but good enough to enjoy solo or with a group. The problem is the atmosphere. Like many bars in Japan, this one allows smoking everywhere in the bar. So many people were smoking cigarettes, even the employees. It made me sick. Smoking is a disgusting habit that shouldn't be encouraged by bar owners. Putting cigarette smoke and emissions into the sky is poisoning the planet and its inhabitants. Bars that enable this horrible behavior should be told that what they are allowing is poisoning others. I will not go back here until they control the smoking issue better. The bar smells like an ashtray. I can't believe so many people gathered there and smoked like that. You might as well burn your money. It's less poisonous to everyone else. Super cool bar. Lots of punk music, great crowd. Good bar food in a great bar atmosphere.  The signs on the decor is incredible, it's from every corner of the world. Definitely recommended. drinks were great, it was amazing, staff was so kind and funny, music was really good and the best people everywhere. didnt try the food but heard its amazing as well!","Monday: 6:00 PM – 5:00 AM

I went there for their Cat Special Exhibition . Interesting exhibition with a great amount of knowledge about Felidae, not only domestic cats, but wild cats as well. I especially enjoy the section which explains how cats look differently when they are angry or feared. Also, the part regarding ways in which genes of cats influence their fur color is another fun part.
The museum itself is not big and it also comes with an outside botanical garden, which now, hosts many sunflowers.
It is a good place to visit, learn, or just chill. An amazing museum filled with incredibly detailed information. There is limited english signage, but if you have a translation app, you can get around this.  There are also many interactive exhibits and is ideal for young children and adults alike. Wonderful place to visit with or without kids. Just so incredible to see so many skeletons of dinosaures and the kids could even touch some of the bones. Many other thing to learn about too. I appreciate the amazing artifacts and knowledge this museum presents. The large scale bones in the center are incredible. However I feel this museum is in need of an interior upgrade. I would still take advantage of seeing this with the Osaka amazing pass and check out the museum and walk around the park nearby it. Nice museum connected to the botanical gardens. I enjoy going when they have special exhibits, just as one about dinosaurs many years ago, or the current cat one. In the information center, there is a cafe and a free section about Osakas nature.

The park is beautifully landscaped with lush greenery, seasonal flowers, and wide open spaces that make it ideal for a leisurely walk or a peaceful afternoon. The paths are wellmaintained and provide lovely views of the river on both sides, with plenty of benches to sit and relax while watching the boats go by.

For those looking to unwind, the park has a calm and tranquil atmosphere, making it a great spot for a quiet stroll or even a picnic. Its especially lovely during spring when the roses are in full bloom at the rose garden. The blend of natural beauty and urban surroundings creates a relaxing environment that is perfect for couples, families, or anyone needing a break. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Osaka and seeking a peaceful retreat in the middle of the city! During my stay at Conrad Osaka, on Nakanoshima, I took pleasure in morning strolls through Nakanoshima Park, a charming public park offering views of the Tosabori and Dojima rivers. The park is affectionately called 'the rose park' by locals for its varied rose collection. This park seems to be popular among families with young children and athletes. Theres a lot of sitting areas and trees to provide shade from the sun. There werent a lot of roses in bloom, but I believe it would be beautiful during roses season.  Nice to look at the sights, buildings, and a calm walk by the river. Amazing collection of rose bushes from all around the world and through at least a century. Nicely landed and perfectly maintained in pretty good blooming even in early October and lots of new vegetation and blossoms. Roses planted by years of invention. Unspoken variety of colors, shapes and sizes. Convenient location close to business part of downtown. 20 min walk to Osaka Castle. Metro station brown line is very close. I'm a flower lover, this place couldn't be left off my list, but was a bit disappointed that we came when all the roses weren't in bloom. But this place is very pretty, we sat for a while to feel the park in the city center, we saw some ducks swimming beside the lake","Monday: Open 24 hours

It is so refreshing for us who does not have parks like this back at home, that is easily accessible. The park offers a lot of activities for the family. It is a few minutes walk from the station. This is the space for teamLAB osaka in the evening. You can come earlier to enjoy the park. We were not able to get inside the botanical garden which closes at 5pm.

A very nice botanical garden. We visited in the evening during a special teamLab event. Very beautiful. I absolutely love botanical gardens, big, small or otherwise, not sure about this one. The gardens themselves appeared to be very well maintained by the people working there. Its seemed very bushy and the botanical plants had long gone, taken over by age or weeds. The ponds and paths were lovely to walk around as with many gardens, but there were many areas that required replanting and new life. Still worth a wander into nature.

There are bathrooms outside the main building, and down a path. The ealking paths were short but pleasant. Very good place to watch birds.  Check though whether the main part is openwas closed today on a Wednesday.  There is part you can get into though which is further N, and that had Narcissus, Blueandwhite and Asian Brown Flycatchers today April 17. Came back here after visiting last year too and it was equally charming this time!! I got to see a lot of different ducks and a blueandwhite flycatcher, which was definetly the highlight!! There are plenty of seats in the observatory where you can look out the windows. A treasure in the city. We wanted to get a bit closer to the birds, but the facilities are very comfortable, and the staff super kind. A good place to watch birds. The number of species is good with several rarities visiting and there is an enclosed viewing area which is frequently open early. Vending machines are available for drinks only.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM

There's a restroom, playground equipment and nice plants. Also some interesting statues from Washington, United States.
It's a rainy day today, so few people were around. This is a great place for Sakura sightseeing. People usually gather around the trees and have picnics all day long during summer. There is a convenience store nearby and plenty of toilets so, you cant go wrong. Beautiful, stunning place. A great place for a walk, a jog, a picnic, or to just look at some flowers.

Many people on public holiday with their children. Restaurants available. The park is definitely big, a star was lost because a lot of areas were either closed zoo or under construction museum when I visited, so I didn't get to experience everything to the fullest.

It was nice to walk around and had a lot of picnic areas where people were enjoying themselves and having fun. Hoping to see the park to its fullest whenever I visit next time! Peaceful, calm and serene park that accommodates an array of flora and fauna within Tennoji. Walking around here while breathing in the fresh air and enjoying the environment is very refreshing for the mind and body. There is a lake nearby where you csn do some birdwatching as there were a few species around when we were there. To think that such a beautiful location exists in the heart of Osaka... Expect to see some breathtaking sceneries here, especially at dusk like when I was there.  You can really feel from this area how much love and care they placed to make it as beautiful as it is.  For anyone visiting Osaka, this is one place that I would recommend to everyone.  A stroll through this park will bring a smile to anyone's face. The entrance ticket is only 500 yen per person. However the animal's variety is quite diverse and complete. The zoo it self is in a good and clean conditions. I think this zoo is very worth it to visit","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Everything was maintained well and we could get good views of the animals. They seemed to be taken good care of, which was important. I'm sure there are fancier zoos but this scratched the itch to see animals and it was a great experience. 500 yen per adult to enter.

The zoo is nice if you want to see animals and it's not crowded with ""loud tourists"" just make sure you don't throw foods into the cage's animals can't eat and digest what we humans consider food....

Nice little half day trip away from all the crowded tourist areas. Some animals appear to be suffering from the heat, but the zoo is wellmaintained with excellent facilities and cleanliness. The food options are good, and the food vending machines are easy to use. There are food trucks throughout the park.
Very affordable price! Only 500 The animals looked depressed and sad, a lot of them clawing at the doors desperate to get out pictures attached. One of the animals' underbelly was covered in sores picture attached. The enclosures are too small. I was quite sad after watching them desperate to escape. They shouldn't be in there. It was clean with clear paths and lots of toilets throughout that park. Staff were nice. The matcha dipping dots were nice. We really enjoyed this zoo. Our toddler was able to see a lot of different animals. The food options were good and it is close to tsutenaku tower and the surrounding shops and restaurants.","Monday: Closed

However, there is a fence so you cannot go inside, and you can only fish or walk on the outer embankment.
There are many raccoon dogs inside the fence.
They also appear outside the fence.
Since it is a reclaimed land, it can be accessed from land, but there is a gate in the middle so the general public cannot enter.
It's a landfill that I don't know what to do with. We have been holding a treeplanting festival every year for over 10 years.
The trees have not taken root at all. Even if you plant trees, they will just wither! Is it a waste of tax money? You can enjoy fishing that is different from the new wharf on the offshore embankment, such as dropin fishing, shark fishing, shrimp fishing, and octopus fishing, all year round. It is especially famous as a sacred place for dropin fishing. Although it is connected to the land, the area along the way is a nogo area,'' so you can only get there by ferry.There are many regulars, and it is a fishing spot that is cherished by everyone, such as cleaning up the surrounding garbage.

However, I occasionally see people coming by bicycle, but it is clearly trespassing'' so I would like them to stop. It is nothing but a nuisance for those who come by the official method.
And since the area where these people come is littered with garbage compared to the surrounding area, it is easy to understand why the number of places where fishing is prohibited is increasing due to the garbage problem caused by illmannered anglers, which is often heard recently. .

""No Trespassing"" signs are posted everywhere, and you should be aware that you are doing something illegal when you have to climb over a high fence.

If we see it, we will take appropriate measures. We do a variety of things such as tree planting, vegetation management, surveys, and reporting.
Participation is currently limited to one person in a passenger car to avoid crowding due to the coronavirus pandemic, such as thinning bamboo forests, mowing grass at tree planting sites, and thinning trees. General public is prohibited from entering.
Occasionally it is brought in for maintenance such as mowing grass.",no operation time,"park, point_of_interest, establishment"

The park is expansive and beautifully maintained, offering plenty of green space to relax and enjoy nature. In the summer, there's a fantastic pool where kids can play and cool off, making it a perfect spot for hot days. Weekends are especially lively with a variety of food carts offering delicious treats, adding to the fun and festive atmosphere.

The park also features a big exhibition space, hosting various events and activities throughout the year, which is a great bonus. While it's a fantastic spot for families, it can get quite crowded on weekends. Nonetheless, Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park is a delightful destination for a day of fun and relaxation. Highly recommend for families looking to spend quality time outdoors! The rose gardens are pretty with lots of flowers and the area at the windmill has nemophilas in bloom.  Its a very big park with lots of resting areas. However the park could be better kept. Over grown grasses in much of the areas. Now Hydrangea is at their best in Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park Flower Valley. Better visit here before the temperature becomes higher. Osaka Metro to KadomaMinami direction, one station prior, is the most convenient traffic. In addition to the greenhouse ""Sakuya KonohanaKan"",  visitors would enjoy here all day long. No gate of the park is formed, so shooting photo early in the morning is available. About food and drink, Lawson at the Western end of the station would be helpful. Went there last Friday. Only few sakura trees scattered near the entrance. But the usual sakura tree range near the mountain area were not growing buds yet. Plum flowers were still there but a week or two passed the peak. Most places look deserted and under renovation as its not the season for flowers. Botanical House is a cafe with a very nice view. A bit cold when we went there. Fairly nice and peaceful. I went during summer so there were not any flowers blooming then. Check my photo to see how it looks like. I am not sure of the best season to go as this is my first time.","Monday: Open 24 hours

They are gigantic and so beautiful  you dont see too many of these if you come from Europe as we have. Theres delicious fried chicken along the way, we were very interested in some roasted chestnuts  but unfortunately nobody was doing them. We only saw one lady selling them raw. Dont go too early, now many shops are open. Exceeded all expectations, the trail from station to Minoh Falls is not just spectacular but also therapeutic as you fallow the path past streams, gorges, temples and beautiful landscapes. Path is sealed and easy to follow. Amazing park that's very accessible from the city. The walk to the falls takes about 30 minutes and is pretty easy. The scenery is beautiful and it's a great way to take a break from the city. a really beautiful walk! if youre starting from minoo station, be careful to take the route with a smaller incline we chose the route with a shrine, and it was quite bad . once your in the park, its an easy walk, lot of families with kids and older folks! lots to see on your way to the waterfall, plenty of shops too but fancy riverside restaurants will require sufficient funds and probably a reservation as well.

id recommend holding out on buying anything till you reach the falls, so you can munch and admire the view.

even in summer it was pretty cooling, especially near the falls! but still, bring a UV umbrella and an electric fan to beat the heat in the unshaded parts of the trail. If youre staying in Osaka, Minoh is the perfect day trip to go connect with nature! Beautiful views, hiking options of varying levels, and fresh stream water. The nearby Minookoen village is a great place to support the locals by purchasing fried maple leaves and souvenirs. This place will live in my heart!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM

Beautiful peach garden with sakura trees. In 2024, I went in late March and midApril.
There was also a peach tree with white, pink, and red flowers blooming on a single tree, giving it a different beauty than plums or cherry blossoms.

Beautiful cherry blossom along the Okawa river . Not crowded with tourists.  Easily catch nice shots of pictures.  Bring your picnic mat to have a picnic and relax here. This charming, spacious park in a quiet, nontouristy part of Osaka is a hidden gem. I loved hearing the gentle sounds of trains passing, crows cawing, and the calming ambiance of nature. Its perfect for morning jogs and offers a peaceful escape from the citys hustle and bustle. The neighborhood is equally nontouristy, adding to the parks serene vibe. I can only imagine how beautiful it must look during Sakura season! Beautiful with sakuras during spring!  Was there today on a thursday at 1pm and was not crowded. It is almost fully bloomed as you can see from my photos.

It was raining almost all day yesterday till night at an area several kilometres from the park so I didn't go and am glad today it still looked lovely! 

There is also a river view and there were food stands. There is also a convenience store right by the station.
The toilets are near the entrance if you're coming from the nearest station.

You can bring a picnic matportable chair if you'd like to sit there for a long time! 

Went there again at 7pm to see what its like at night, several night stands were still open with people around.

God's creation is so beautiful


04.04.24 I visited the place during Tenjin Matsuri, the place is beside Okawa river and line with cherry blossom trees although it wasnt season at that time but must be good to visit during its season.  It was teeming with streetfood and beers along the path. I will revisit during the day and less crowd. Spring is here! The sakura tree blooms around 95. There are people on picnic mats doing hanami flower watching. The river, boats and bridges really elevate the experience surrounded by beautiful blooms. I believe April 6 onwards would be the best viewing dates but starting last April 5, 2024 you could definitely enjoy hanami here. Depending on the weather if it continues to be sunny and not windy this could last a week until the blooms start to fall.

I saw a god damn OWL!

Vibes were good. Overall, it's a nice place to walk around during an event. However, summer months are extremely hot and there is not much shade. A few of the German events like Christmas Market formerly in Umeda before the pandemic and Octoberfest are quite lackluster when compared with similar events in Tokyo.

Large items are still easy to collect, but there are a lot of straws and product packaging films, and it takes a lot of effort to collect them all. I was embarrassed to finally understand the importance of switching to materials that decompose naturally.
This beach is said to have a terrain where a large amount of garbage washes up from the neighboring river after heavy rain.

On April 18, 2023, I went to see an exhibit called ""Poison."" The period is until May 28th. Even though it was a weekday, it was so popular that it took us a while to tour. But it was interesting. You need to buy a ticket at the entrance, and the sameday ticket costs 1,800 yen for adults, which is not cheap. A special museum shop is being held, and the location and contents are different from the regular shops.

Although it is a separate building from the City Museum of Natural History, it is considered to be part of the Natural History Museum. Facilities include a nature hall, exhibition rooms 1 to 5, an atrium, a coffee corner, and a museum shop. Tickets for the Natural History Museum can be purchased at the reception. You can also enter the botanical garden.

There are many events going on especially on holidays, so you can enjoy them if you target them on their website. Intense exhibitions are sometimes held in collaboration with private companies or other local governments, and may incur an admission fee. The MAKINO Exhibition, which introduces the life and achievements of botanist Dr. Tomitaro Makino, is currently being held at Hifumi Hall on the 1st floor. As you all know, Dr. Tomitaro Makino is the model for the main character of the currently airing morning drama Ranman.'' As this is a visiting room for Kochi Prefecture, the exhibits are not that large, but in addition to the local area of Kochi that is associated with Dr. Makino, there are also plant specimens and historical materials associated with Osaka. Even so, when I look at the photographs and historical materials, I get the strong feeling that Dr. Makino was literally an innocent person. I'm looking forward to the future development of the drama.
Also, in the entrance area, there are plants related to Dr. Makino, such as Baika's orensis and Musinamo, so don't miss them. Adjacent to Nagai Botanical Garden and Natural History Museum in Nagai Park
The Flower, Green, and Nature Information Center has information exhibits about Osaka's nature,
There are restaurants such as Forest'' where you can enjoy light meals.
Admission to the information center is free.

Hattori Ryokuchi Park,"1-chōme-1 Hattoriryokuchi, Toyonaka, Osaka 561-0873, Japan",4.2,34.7759539,135.4881946,"Nice park with a lot of different spots to chill, walk, relax and enjoy a nature break. Amazing colors during the Fall, I specially liked the lights in the Gingko and Bamboo trees.
Pay a visit to the open air Farm Museum nearby, really good experience there aswell. Wide open area of greenery in the middle of Osaka. Lots of people and family in the weekend but you will not find it is packed since the area is so wide. Fun activities can be found here such as street bazaar, gardens, campings, barbeque, children playground, and many more. Very recommended place to have a healing. The Japanese Folk Houses Museum in Hattori Ryokuchi Park is an architectural and cultural museum that relocates and exhibits typical 'minka' houses from the northeast to the south of Japan. Minka refers to the houses of the common people. Most of the houses on display here are farmhouses. Due to the long length of the Japanese archipelago, the climate differs greatly between the southern and northern parts of the country. As a result, the shapes of minka and the construction methods used vary greatly from region to region. In this minka garden, visitors can compare and learn about these regional differences.
Minka is not very decorative, but you can feel the Japanese view of nature in the primitive and elegant appearance of the wooden structure. Pretty large and good park for most things... But, the recent remake of an open play field into a rental sports field is really unfortunate. Now there is no real good place to play and throw balls and such, meaning people play on the walk ways, making it more crowded and with a slight chance of getting a ball or such in your head mostly on weekends.
There is also a large bamboo area that could be really beautiful, but unfortunately it is mostly blocked off. It was different before. a lovely place! Clean, safe, and relaxing, with a park for children to play. Having a Starbucks inside adds to the convenience, and the beauty of the sakura and flowers during their season must make it even more wonderful.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Shirokita Park,"3 Chome-29 Ikue, Asahi-ku, Osaka, 535-0004, Japan",3.9,34.7288459,135.5380206,"I've really been enjoying this park. Especially for the lake but also for the cherry blossoms.
It's in a great location next to the Yodogawa River too. Stunning display of irises and only 200 entry fee. We loved it. They had also set up some smaller areas and had some plants set up purely for photographs. We think they could raise the entry fee to 300 and it would still be good value. Most of our photos are on the SLR camera, but here are a few phone shots for reference. This is a pretty park with a large pond. You can walk over a low rise to the Yodogawa River which is also nice to walk along. Very peaceful. This is an amazing local park. Its situated between Asahiku and Awaji area. Theres plenty of bike trails and places to sit and chill. Theres an expansive pond where people come and fish. The Shirokita bridge leads over to the Awaji area. There are plenty areas for children to come and play. Great Pokemon Go stops. The Osaka
Institute of Technology is within walking distance, so many college student frequent the park.
Amazing neighbor park. The cherry blossoms are preparing to bloom soon, so many people will be venturing into the park. READ not enough places to sit, food takes HELLA long, they dont even fill the drinks Rj the top. Tour like 15 minutes MAX. I mean you get what you pay for I guess.","Monday: Open 24 hours

"Kurondo Park, Forest of Osaka","3192-1 Kisabe, Katano, Osaka 576-0002, Japan",4.0,34.7654322,135.7048192,"Good hiking place, has BBQ spot. A little less ""managed"" than other hiking trails in Japan. Easy hiking in peaceful surroundings. Pay parking in all seasons except winter. I went to see the skunk cabbage, but I couldn't see it blooming probably because the time was not right. I was able to see Rakusho. Katakuri flowers were blooming again. There is a free parking lot, and it is close to Osaka city, so it seems easy to go there. Gates open from 9am It is a large garden with a Kurondo pond.
There are camping facilities at Kurondo Pond, and many people also fish there.
The course along the river that connects Kurondo Pond to Hoshidaenchi is soothing.
It's also fun to stroll around the park, including the daffodil pond, Yatsuhashi Bridge where skunk cabbage grows, and the observation deck with a great view.
There is also a free parking lot, so I think it is perfect for families. First and foremost, set Google Maps to the parking lot!
You'll be guided to the edge of a residential area that has nothing to do with you lol
The parking lot fee is a bit high at 800 yen, but if you are going to play for a day, there is no problem at all 
There are many shops and restaurants inside, you can take a boat ride around the pond, and you can also enjoy fishing, so I think it's a fulfilling place for those who like it 
The hiking courses are also quite difficult to understand, but they are divided into different courses, such as 15minute courses and 30minute courses, with some ups and downs that are easy for beginners to enjoy.
The course runs around the perimeter of the park so that even beginners can feel at ease, so it feels like you can deviate from the course and return to the park at any time.
Fully stocked with vending machines, ice cream, and snacks, as well as camping and a daytrip BBQ area, it feels like a comprehensive facility that is very safe for outdoor beginners  
I think each price is a good deal if you can play this much.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM

Very greenish and I can see maple leaves, maybe should go during fa season will be a great idea! If you change the water...Is it cleaner in the winter than in the summer? The autumn leaves on the path in front of Murasakitei are progressing and I think it's almost time to see them.
There aren't that many people on weekdays,
The people who come here are all nature lovers and people who want to spend some quiet time, so there aren't too many intangible people. It is not very noticeable in Hanahaku Memorial Park.
It's quiet and feels like a world of wabisabi.
I personally like the path leading from the back of the Japanese garden to Murasakitei and the Shiki no Pond.
I don't see many people. It is well maintained.
It doesn't have a minimini feel, but it does give off an atmosphere.
It is also a photo spot with models.",no operation time,"park, point_of_interest, establishment"

There are places for field sports and stadium very close by Perhaps not the kind of garden you'd expect within a Japanese castles walls. A pretty wide place with a great view towards the castle. There's a lot of open space and benches below trees. A great place to calm down after visiting the crowded castle. More like a park. Great views of the castle and city with none of the crowds.  200 yen for entry. Its an amazing place to enjoy the hanami season and welcome in Spring. The crowds can get large, but it is a beautiful walk to share in the experience with others who wish to enjoy their day! It is a a great public space that I will make time to take a stroll when I find the time. A garden beside the castle which I highly recommend that you visit as well.

Daisen Park is vast and has plenty of spots worth taking photos of. I love the Japanese Garden and the pond area. Given the chance, I would bring my parents here in the future. Very big sitting space with benches here and there. Theres a pond that gives the park such a beautiful view.

I ended up doing a bit late this year but got a really beautiful shot of the sunset seeping through the cherry blossom trees!

You can walk from mikunigaoka station for about 1215 minutes or if youre coming by Nankai line, but the closest station is JR Mozu station. Beautiful garden. We spent around 1 hour walking around and relaxing from the busy city. Perfect for a short timeout. Love this park be it Sakura or autumn foliage season. Not a popular tourist spot, you can enjoy the scenery without seeing many tourists.
httpsyoutu.be1dFvhv4wpPQ?siJoq9l6cCGmnrvbuN The park itself was pretty boring.
Not much happening.
I guess it might have looked more beautiful in spring or summer.

The only redeeming place in this park was the Japanese garden. You'll need 200 Yen to enter the garden.

Expo '70 Commemorative Park,"Senribanpakukoen, Suita, Osaka 565-0826, Japan",4.3,34.8060148,135.5287848,"Visited the park area which around 260 each for adult and could be purchased on the main entrance.

Came around 2PM during sunny day with a clear sky. The park literally spacious, I am just thrilled and enough to see the Tower of the Sun The park itself is huge, runs many seasonal and special events and can host a huge amount of people.
However, the train area is usually always far too busy for any of these events and getting to event locations takes a long time so you must arrive much earlier than you think and you'll probably get home later than you think too.
It's clean and well equipped with toilets and shops however you won't find a Lawson for Loppi tickets, staff are not the most friendly and fireworks events will have next to no extra food stalls available. However, you can usually take in your own items too. Though no umbrellas, mats and chairs. The park is enormous with lots of facilities for people especially kids. Its a very good place for family picnic especially when its cherry blossom season. The other side of the park is a huge shopping mall with a wide variety of shops and restaurants. I surely come again when visiting Osaka. Magnificent tower of the sun!
Theres an entrance fee to get inside the park and you have to buy tickets to the exhibition inside the structure!
Be aware you need to reserve the tickets for exhibition way in advance through their website! Thats the only downside
Theres a park is huge park pleasant for walking!
There are also a lot of bbq spots so absolutely recommended for a picnic day This park is quiet big actually. There is a big mall accross and also the biggest ferris wheel in Japan is also here. The ride will be 1000 per head. The entrance for the expo70 park is just 260. You can also try to see the museum within the Tower of the sun which strangely look like a penguin for me hahha.

Apparently there used to be a shrine here, but it seems to have disappeared after being enshrined with Kaguhasi Shrine. Thanks to the neighbors who always keep the house clean, we are able to use it comfortably. Despite this, some people go out of their way to leave behind cigarette butts and food waste when they return home. The park is not a garbage dump, so please take your garbage home with you. I use it all the time with my kids.
Today, my daughter asked me to use it even though I was suffering from a cold.

My second daughter became friends with her brother who came with her mom.

Even though I'm brazenly borrowing the boy's bicycle, I enjoy riding it around as if it were my own.

Eventually, my eldest daughter also joined in and started playing in the mud! !
Everyone was having fun while getting muddy.

The older brother who lent me his bicycle also
My mom also kindly agreed.
Thank you very much.

If we meet again, let's play together! !  It's a small park where families, children, and sometimes office workers take a break.It's surrounded by residential areas and apartments, and there are many people living nearby. You can feel free to respond even if you call out to us. It's nice to have a swing that even small children can ride on, but there is water to wash their hands.
It's a little inconvenient because there's no toilet, but there's a Family Mart right after you pass through the railroad tracks, which is nice.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Despite being a festive day  sports day  yesterday,there was not many people and not noisy.
Try to book ahead and be respectful of others by not speaking loudly,in order to absorb the lovely psychedelic music effects and the combination with nature.
The pond and waterlilies, with those glowing floating marshmallows shapes was hypnotic.
There was no caf open, nowhere to enjoy a drink or small food around, what a real shame.
We were really hungry and tired as it's quite a long walk from Nagai station,at the end of an excursion day.
Please be more aware of visitors need! Inspiring and Beautiful!

TeamLab Garden in Osaka was an inspiring and unique experience! The blend of art, nature, and technology was beautifully done, with creative and exciting installations. The organization was smooth, making the experience even more enjoyable. A mustsee for anyone seeking something truly special! I love it. So far the best attraction Ive been to in Japan. Def recommend for anyone who love interacting with artworks, or anyone who enjoys nature.

We spent around 1 and a half hour to finish all the zone. But it was raining so we were in a bit of a rush. Buy ticket in advance and come a bit early if you want to be one of the first to enter. Very nice garden and the lighting makes it a very special place in the evening. It spreads out well with the visitors and is not too crowded. I would buy tickets online in advance to be on the safe side, I don't know if they refuse further admission once a certain number of visitors have entered in order to maintain the pleasant atmosphere. Always a fan of teamLabs, but this was a special experience. Most are inside, and taking this outdoors made it a bit magical. I was kind of sad the whole day, and this just brightened it up.

They had about four exhibits to see, all with their own meaning. They included Japanese and English narration, so no one gets confused. You can walk through this beautiful park with family, friends, or a loved one. I saw a lot of couples and families with kids, all with smiles and wonder in their eyes.

Would definitely recommend this lovely experience, especially for such a reasonable price!","Monday: 6:30 – 9:30 PM

The trail to the waterfall was quite the walk 45mins to and fro, total 2hrs, but definitely worth it. Highly recommend if you're one for mother nature. Be sure to get the fried maple leaves when you're there! This waterfalls is so nice. The view is really relaxing. Though you just need to take like a 30mins to 40 mins walk on a public trail from the bus and train station. But its worth it after all. So nice!! Easy walk to the waterfalls. There are some nice side hikes if you want to extend your journey. It will look spectacular when the leaves change but I'm sure it will be mobbed. Perfect quick hike, there a direct train to the trailhead the hankyu line. If you want to escape the city and be with nature, this is the perfect spot. Easy river trail although I havent tried the mountain trail.  Its paved all the way to the waterfalls and you can sit there infront of the falls, you cant swim. There are stores selling beers, ice cream and meals but there are machines also if they are closed already. You will pass along temple and houses going up. Theres no fee to hike up also.

Best part is the whole floor is all glass totally unblocked great view at Harukas 300 observatory!  I literally said out loud WOW! the moment the lift door opened at 60th level. Stunning overview of Osaka and the buildings looked like Lego from this height and cars like toy cars I spent a few hours here. There is a cafeteria and a souvenir shop at level 5958. Amazing place to see the city. Every place I go zone or my favorite things to do is view points! This one was not an exception with fantastic 360 views! Absolutely worth coming and paying to go. Great views, quite high up, highest view in Osaka. Has some food options at the top as well, but they looked very busy and long lines. Some seating available on the dining floor, but most were taken for a long time. Sunset view was quite nice, but not facing the busy sides of Osaka.

Queue to leave at 8pm was very long. Harukas 300 offers an impressive view of Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe. The ride to the 60th floor is thrilling, and the modern glass architecture lets in plenty of light. Once at the top, you can quietly take in the vastness of Japan. It's a place that invites reflection and leaves unforgettable impressions. Buy your tickets ahead of time online and make sure to go at sunset to watch the city lights come on! You will check in on the 16th floor and be led into an elevator that will take you to the 60th floor where the observation deck is. We went around 8pm on a Monday and had no wait time at all to enter. The view up there is amazing. The massive windows allow for 360 degree non disruptive views of Osaka. The city spans for miles towards the mountains. We had some food at the cafe on the top floors and enjoyed the night time views at a window table. Food was delicious and not too expensive. A must do experience in Osaka that is super cheap. Entrance fee is only about 12 USD and 500 worth the money for the views. Youre not allowed to bring any outside food or drinks inside so make sure to throw it out on the 16th floor before checking in.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM

They are paddy fields'', wetlands'', near waterways'', wildflower plazas'', fields'', Hasuda reservoirs'', and coppice and seedling forests''.
Open all year round, free admission
April to October 900 a.m. to 530 p.m.
November to March 900 a.m. to 430 p.m.
Regarding the animals that live there, we divide them into foreign animals and ancient Japanese animals.
We do not exterminate aquatic alien species, but we do raise them in separate aquariums. Insects and mammals are quite difficult to understand. Plants may be exterminated depending on the purpose of the location, even if they are not invasive species.
It's bad to have miscellaneous trees growing in wildflower fields, fields, and walkways. We exterminate them from fall to spring, when the work efficiency is relatively good, but it is a work that has to be done and requires effort, but it is tiring and not fun. To be honest, when the observation garden was set up, I had no idea how difficult it would be to get rid of miscellaneous trees.
If the wildflower field is left alone without much thought, the invasive goldenrod will definitely flourish. Since Senboku New Town is a developed area, goldenrod flourished, but Japanese kuzu'' kuzu overcame it. Kudzu is a more troublesome plant than goldenrod, and it is said to be impossible to get rid of because its roots are deep and it stores starch. To prevent this from happening, I mow the grass well and make sure that I can see things that bloom cute flowers a member of the Japanese lizard family...I don't know if this is also an invasive species, but it's difficult to get rid of it, but it blooms beautiful flowers this time of year. , intensively mowing tall weeds to make rare plants stand out. Although it is not Urasenke or Omotesenke, it does produce a certain kind of beauty with sensitivity. Yes.

2024.5.4 The wetland was filled with water, and a pair of hybrid ducks had arrived. I was there last year too. They are very accustomed to people and will not try to run away even if you approach them. It seems like they are asking for food. But but. I can't ask the pair of ducks that have come to visit me to leave and go somewhere else, so I would be very happy if they could make a small living there and raise their young. I felt a strange emotion. However, last year's egg ended up in the digestive system of a raccoonlike mammal. In June, the lotus leaves are so thick that you can't see the water surface.

In February 2024, I dug lotus roots. Normally, I don't want to dig lotus roots in the cold winter. The event was scheduled to be held in November, but due to prolonged rain, nearly 50 people were unable to attend. Wearing raincoats and rain boots was too unfortunate for ordinary people. So, a small group of people tried to dig with ecomullets, but they were unable to dig all the way with the tongwa. On this day, a woman was very active, and when she used a hoe, a white lotus root appeared. A truly lucky girl. Girl? We hope that many members of the public will come to dig lotus roots next year. I found out about this place in Tsurumi Ryokuchi before this summer. It's already been 29 years since the Flower Expo was opened in 1990, and I've been here many times since it's in my neighborhood, so I wonder why I never knew about such a relaxing place. About 40 years ago, rice fields, fields, and lotus fields could be seen everywhere in this area. I was able to see a variety of aquatic creatures, insects, and other creatures for the first time in a while. I think I will come here every year to take pictures of the flora and fauna. From the entrance on Hanahaku Street, go up a slight slope and turn left and then right until you reach the large flower bed in front of the windmill. The lotus flowers were blooming beautifully. It feels like you've come to a peaceful countryside.
Walking through the footpaths will make you feel like you are in the Japanese countryside.
I'm sure anyone will feel healed.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 4:30 PM

This area is part of an environmental restoration effort, designed to bring nature back into the urban landscape. With its lush greenery, native plants, and revitalized natural habitats, its a serene spot for nature lovers to enjoy a walk or relax by the water.

The zones walking paths wind through areas that are teeming with wildlife, providing a rare chance to observe birds and other animals in their natural environment, right in the middle of the city. Its a wonderful spot for anyone looking to escape the urban hustle and reconnect with nature, making it perfect for families, birdwatchers, or those just looking to enjoy some peace and quiet. Unlike the sandy beach zone, it is full of water, but if the water quality were to improve, I wonder if more aquatic creatures would settle there.
You can see waterfowl. And did someone let it go? Or is it a descendant that is said to have been brought over during the Great War? You can also see nutria. ",no operation time,"park, point_of_interest, establishment"

A must see if you are in Osaka in late Marchearly April. Visited last year. It was wider than I expected and there were many different types of hydrangeas blooming.
It's also the rainy season and there is a lot of soil, so it's damp and there are insects like mosquitoes, so I think it's a good idea to take precautions before going. Although the scale is small, flowers such as hydrangeas are blooming quietly.
The NHK broadcast said that the seventiered flower Shichidanka is a rare flower. There are hydrangeas on the slope of the waterside space at the southern end of the row of cherry blossom trees.
Although there were not many plants, we were able to enjoy many different types of hydrangeas.
It seems easier to walk around if you enter the south end passage from the outside road. Did you know this place?

I went to the park at midnight to see the Perseid meteor shower and saw some very beautiful meteors.
Halfway through, a group of older people came to the same spot, and as if to disturb us, whose eyes were getting used to the darkness, they lit up the area with flashlights and smartphones, making their way to the depths of the mountain to avoid light and catch meteors. Are you an idiot for coming here to have fun?
Yeah, I'm getting older...I should act with a little more consideration for the inconvenience to those around me!
I think the location is a very good place for astronomical observation in Osaka Prefecture.

Both my daughters and I grew up playing with calico critters which is what they are called in the US and it was so cool to go into the life size houses. To be a kid again.

There were other things for small children to enjoy as well if you have little ones. Entrance fee. And then all activities and feeding at additional fees. Dun come on weekdays.... low crowds so most activity is limited in operations.
Flowers... none in June. This is surely a kids place as there are many attractions for them to indulge.

The animal attractions will definitely bring delight to the kids.

Plentiful of eye catching floral for photo memory for the family too.

Last of all the attraction friendly staff is another bonus to the already overwhelming attraction.

Will definitely revisit this wonderful place again in my next Japan trip.

Parent this is a definite visit with your lovely kids , so do not give it a miss. Nice park but too expensive for a day visit. The entrance price is 1,000 yen for adults and 600 yen up to JH school students but that's just to enter, you have to pay extra for everything else it can become  very expensive very quickly if you are a family of 4 or 5.

definitely worth Small park with seasonal flowers. We went during the Nemophila Festival and the walk on the grounds took us about 30 minutes, including the time it took to stop and take pictures. It's best to come on a sunny day. It was overcast when I was there and the experience wasn't as good because the sky was gray. Bring a jacket even if it's warm, the area is extremely windy. The flowers called""Baby blue eyes"" . It was quite hot and sunny in Apr. You may need to prepare for an umbrella or a hat. 1,500 yen for entrance fee. Very pretty, if overpriced little park to see tons of nemophila by the sea. Good luck getting here, though, as there aren't many busses and traffic can be insane. It took me two hours to get here from less than 3km during golden week. It was so bad I'm seriously reconsidering going to the Osaka Expo next year, which will be held nearby.

Imaike exists, but a library building is built floating in the pond.

There is a Sakura Coffee shop nearby, and Matsubara Central Park has a plaza within the park with plenty of play equipment and is crowded with many local residents and families with their children.

It was very well maintained and quite nice for a walk. Aside from the pavilion there weren't a lot of places to have a rest especially those shielded from the sun, but it is still absolutely worth visiting. Quite a peaceful and well maintained garden, you can stroll around the pond, trees and small structures to enjoy the landscaped natural beauty.  There's also seating in a couple of places to relax and enjoy the serenity.

Note that there's plenty of mosquitoes in this garden, especially in the late afternoon when we went so if you are prone to bites you should be prepared and spray yourself.

Its not just about science, but also about daily life and world culture. The WHO's FOODS FES. executive committee, which operates ""Kitchen Car Koshien,"" started this event in September 2022 with the desire to provide a place where students who want to start their own businesses after graduation and students who want to challenge themselves to realize what they want to do can do so. The event was launched in September 2022. Although students play a leading role in this event, many of them have experience in opening stores at events or have already established their own stores, and the quality of the food is as good as that of professionals.

The winner of ""Kitchen Car Koshien,"" held on September 28 and 29, was decided fairly by sales, which were determined by purchases from visitors. This year's event, the 3rd edition of the Kitchen Car Koshien, will feature a record number of student exhibitors 13, and is expected to be a very exciting event for everyone. We hope you will come and enjoy the event with your family and friends. Just arrived early in the morning. Relaxing and a nice place. There are benches to sit down and a playground and kid place.

Beautiful sunshine in Xmas, and cozy stuff to see and buy.

It's highly recommended
there's some port town events in it. This is a great park for a picnic or for the kids to play, or even just a stroll. A very big grassy area, lots of trees and shade, and seasonal flower gardens. Or you could climb to the top or the hill, which is actually the stadiumgymnasium. This was created from all the soil that was removed to create the the Chuo train line tunnel out to Nanko Island. This park has two play areas and is a hit with the kids. There are also often markets and food stalls events here. Great place to spend a quiet day on your own under the trees in the park, but it can be just the opposite, if you have children that are energetic the park has plenty of space. The facilities are pretty good although I would choose the ones inside they are much cleaner

If you're into sports etc it's a great place to go.

If you want to eat lunch at the park best take your own from home or the local convenience store first . There are some restaurants around but can be a bit of a hike to get to them. I went there at night 
So only had night views.
A beautiful place. Greeneries as far as you can see. The park is located in front of the west exit of Asashiobashi subway station Chuo line. It's the favorite place for the elders to spend their Sunday. In the morning, you can join taichi session with an instructor.","Monday: Open 24 hours

It was a holiday so there were loads of kids and families. We had to stop by for some exercise. Lots of climbing apparatuses for the kids. Great little spot. My son like this playground a lot although it really is geared towards older kids but I saw a lot of young kids using it it can be a bit physically challenging for young children to walk inside but it is a really fun playground and it's a nice stop to have before going to see the castle I've traveled to numerous places around the world, and I must say, this playground is truly amazing. It's impeccably maintained, and it features a gigantic slide. Located less den 200m away from morinomiya subway station, we brought our 3 year old there around 3plus on a weekday afternoon before walking the castle grounds. It was a windy day and climbing up the steps to take the giant roller slide was cold after a few rounds. However it was worth it as we have never tried this kind of slide in our lives, not to mention its free! There are vending machines on site, as well as a water cooler and some benches.

There is also a paid facility enclosed for younger kids just beside it. Convenience store and a Starbucks is also visible. If you live nearby.  You can go for a walk or jog. There are coffee shops and restaurants inside.
In spring it's the best place to go for cherry blossom viewing.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Seems like a popular spot for locals and tourist alike to hangout and get a quick restrelaxation. A good spot to also have a few bites to eat with the surrounding restaurants and dish outs in the area.

Lots of action happens here. At night the vibes are different. The drunk students are out and about. But, the vibes are still good. Definitely had a moment to remind myself, ""Oh yeah, I'm in Japan"". Good little place for a sit down and restrelax.
Partner and I shared some Takoyaki from a shop across the road Kougaryu Takoyaki.....couldn't have had a better chill.
And brought young lad with us backgroundbob for the trip. The heart of shopping for clothes. New and old. In fact something for everyone. Lots of small eateries so dont forget to try out the local delicious offerings. One of my favourite places in Japan, it is so different from everything else there is to offer, in terms of lifestyle, fashion, local culture, this place stands out.
Met lots of new people, who showed me around town and taught me how to have a good time in Osaka.
Definitely worth looking at if you feel like a change of pace in Japan. Great spot to hang out and meet locals and international friends! Centrally located for shopping and snacks during the day and a fun hangout spot surrounded by nightlife after the sun sets.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Very nice grounds to stroll around and take in the views. The exterior of the castle is impressive. But since it has all been rebuilt, the inside is like a modern museum I was hoping they would try to recreate the original interior design.
Be careful about which day you go  it can get very crowded. Beautiful park, you could have a casual walk there and go to the Osaka castle They modernized the place with restaurants and shops. Lot of events held here, like the Gyoza Festival. Yatai festival here.
It was very crowded around noon, so youd better come here from the beginning or avoid lunch or dinner time.

Perfect spot . Goes on and on and on.  But avoid mid day time when it s hot , the tarmac makes it even worst . The night seems amazing with a view of Umera skyline ! Not many trees so theres not much shade. And there isnt a view of the river, its obstructed by overgrown weeds. March, 2023

Yodogawa River Park is a beautiful urban park located in the heart of Osaka, Japan. It's a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, offering a scenic escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.

One of the highlights of the park is the Yodogawa River itself, which winds its way through the heart of the park. Visitors can stroll along the riverbanks, taking in the picturesque scenery and enjoying the peaceful sound of flowing water.

In addition to the river, the park offers a range of other attractions and amenities. There are several large bridges that cross the river, providing excellent views of the surrounding area. The Umeda Sky Building, a towering skyscraper that's one of the most recognizable landmarks in Osaka, can also be seen from the park.

The Nakatsu Reed Beds, located near the park's western edge, are another popular attraction. These wetlands provide a unique ecosystem for a variety of plants and animals, making them a fascinating destination for nature lovers.

For those who want to get even closer to nature, the park offers several urban campsites. These sites provide a unique opportunity to experience the great outdoors in the heart of the city.

One thing to keep in mind when visiting Yodogawa River Park is that the terrain can be a bit uneven in places. This can make walking or cycling a bit challenging at times, but it's all part of the park's charm. nicest palce to spend some quality time in peace and calmness beautiful view and spacy place to ride you bicycle and do some jogging and excercise and spend the leisure time.

So peaceful and relaxing. Also there is a food place nearby which is good. didn't plan to go there yesterday but we did visit. the flower fields are not as big as I think, but it's free tho. A Delightful Winter Escape with Golden Leaves and Family Fun

I recently visited Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park in early December and was enchanted by its beauty even in the winter season. The park still showcased a stunning display of golden and red leaves, creating a picturesque and serene atmosphere.

What impressed me the most was how kidfriendly the park is. They offer trolleys for little ones, making it convenient for families to explore the park together. There are ample spaces with tables where families can relax and enjoy a peaceful picnic amidst nature's charm.

One of the highlights of my visit was the rose garden. Despite the time of year, the roses were in bloom, and their vibrant colors added a touch of elegance to the surroundings. It was a delightful sight that left me in awe.

If you visit Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park on the weekend, don't miss the food market. I highly recommend trying the delicious pizza available there. It's the perfect treat to satisfy your taste buds while enjoying the park's ambiance.

Moreover, Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park is a delightful winter escape that offers a mesmerizing display of golden and red leaves. it's worth noting that the park's pathways are flat and suitable for trolleys. Families with young children can bring their own trolleys or strollers to navigate the park comfortably.

Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park's proximity to the subway station, the availability of a convenience store, and the accessibility for trolleys make it a convenient and familyfriendly destination. Enjoy a seamless visit to the park and make the most of your time surrounded by nature's beauty.

. The rose garden is a mustvisit, and the weekend food market, particularly the pizza, is a delectable treat. Don't miss the chance to experience the park's beauty and enjoy a memorable outing with your loved ones. The Windmill is fake, it is powered by electricity not wind. The tulips and other flowers planted near the windmill along with the adjacent rose garden are great though Large park.

Aside from that, this area is quite good to sit around and read book or just chilling if the weather is clear and sunny. Was staying nearby at the Hotel Gracery.  No fitness center facilities at the hotel.  Naniwa park was a few blocks away.  Review is mostly for the calisthenics area and jogging track.  Some people working out in the morning, locals jogging around the rubberized track, families using the two separate playground areas and a local youth baseball team about to start a game.  Great place to get some exercise while visiting Osaka. It's a mix of enjoyable corners and litter covered spots.
If it wasn't for the families with children using the play areas I wouldn't have stopped. Its just an ok park. 350m running track around a baseball pitch. Climbing areaslides for kids. Wide area with benches and some tree cover around it. Used to be full of homeless but now its pretty clean. No toilets Nice place to run. The loop is pretty small so it might get boring after a while, still perfect to keep exercising while on holidays.

ThereS a fishing area too. There's softball and rugby field, where you can watch them practice. There's a big field for runing too. Very interesting venue with great sports ground and playground for kids! A bit far from downtown unfortunately but no shortage of tourists there. The play ground is very well organized and also safe. From 3years old to 9 years old kids love to play 3hours. Three Parking lots are bit small comparing size of facilities Visited for rugby worl cup game.  20 minute walk from station.  As an outdoor stadium, it was hot.   Locals had towels on heads or hats to keep themselves cool.   I liked the stadium though Went with a small group of children to see the show in the planetarium, it was really good although for the younger aged children 5year olds a little bit long so they got bored quickly.
Outside there is a great big play area that is just perfect for children to spend so much time enjoying the freedom to run, climb and just be silly. The only downside is there are no toilets close by you need to go to the main building.
Inside the main building on the 3rd floor is a play area where the children can play on a number of indoor equipment such as mats, rope climbing, and more.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Its a perfect place for hanami flower viewing picnics, drawing both locals and tourists.

Aside from cherry blossom season, Sakuranomiya Beach offers a relaxing environment yearround, with plenty of open space to walk, jog, or simply sit by the river and take in the scenery. The waterfront area has a serene ambiance, ideal for unwinding or spending time with family and friends. Its location along the riverbank also provides excellent views of the surrounding bridges and parks, making it a great spot for photography. The beach was really fun, but unfortunately, tourists had thrown a lot of trash around in the garden areas. We saw beautiful koi under lily pads so big that they made the koi seem small, many different species of birds, and even a family of muskrats. The flowers were in bloom, and several species of butterfly were there, but I could not get a picture of those. You can join kayak tour and see deep Osaka .

You can enjoy the traditional Japanese summer festival very well! There is one night market surrounding the park. Many people buy the foods and kids play around. Nice quiet park near Osaka Castle with cherry trees and a playground for kids.

However, there is Osaka Castle Park nearby and people tend to go there, so I think it's a littleknown spot for cherry blossom viewing. Since the area is large, there is no need to reserve a spot for cherry blossom viewing, and even if you go on the same day, you can easily find a good spot. a small, rather neglected, poorly maintained park The park is visited by many people even outside of the cherry blossom season. Most of the people are taking walks early in the morning. This is a spot where you can clearly see the fireworks of the Tenjin Festival. It's beautiful during cherry blossom season.
Also, the cherry blossoms along the river from Miyakojima Bridge to here are beautiful.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The rose garden in Osaka was one of the best experiences we've had. There's a beauty in the serenity that this place provides. We went during lunchtime and saw many people quietly enjoying their lunches while admiring the beauty around them. There are many different roses here with cards explaining their origins and planting dates. The area is free to enter and provides a better view than some of the locations we've paid for. If you want to see some beautiful flowers while enjoying a peaceful stroll, I highly recommend that you find the opportunity to spend some time here. Visited last June 26 with my senior mom. A few roses were already in bloom.

The park is big enough for walks and runs, even for strolling around with friends and family. They also have benches around the park for those that prefer to pass some time. Great place to relax and was one of my last spots! The fountains and overall vibe is great. Feel free to stop here and sip on a refreshment and take it all in! A fantastic rose garden. Went during Golden Week so there were lots of families and even some sunbathers 

Edit August 4, not much to see at the moment. Garden is mostly overrun with with weeds and grass You won't believe riees like these even possibly exist. Very nicely planned rose garden with a waterfall and a creek running through. Great variety of tea rose hybrids from all the world. In October little poor blooming, however every bush has some flowers. Nice fountain at the entrance. Popular place to photograph kinds and microscopic dogs. Seems August is ghr best time to visit, but still very enjoyable in Early October as well. Punlic access free, toilets at the entrance.","Monday: Open 24 hours

There are two sections to the play area, a large structure with several slides and a smaller area for younger kids. Lots of parents with school kids here after school hours. As a tourist who lives in a country without a lot of shared, public play spaces I found this place amazing. My kids really loved it here. Great park, easily accessible from the metro. Visiting families will find this a nice break from tourist itineraries. Nice park for kids to run around and get some exercise and fun  Large park with various play equipment. Just a short 510 minute walk from Esaka Station. There were a few  food trucks there as well offering different food such as french fries and sweets.

Unlike the sports corner in the west garden, the east garden is a calm space with welltended flowers.

However, please don't wake up Heihachiro Oshio, whose dream came to an end in this place, once again in order to correct modern political corruption.

Politicians, please straighten up and stop drowning in your own interests! Utsubo Park is famous for its rose garden, and the Higashien garden near Yotsubashisuji Street has many benches and is a place where you can relax.
On weekdays, many people from nearby offices take their lunch break here, and on weekends, it's crowded with families.
There are many restaurants in Yotsubashisuji, and there are many types of takeout options, so it's best when it's nice outside

Each is marked with the name of the rose, which helps to find them should the display encourage ideas for gardening at home. The area also has subway station access, as well as a cafe, vending machine and restrooms. There is also seating to enjoy the flowers. I visited in mid October and was surprised but the lushness of this park. The flowers are beautiful and wellcared for.
It's free, so if you have time, you should check it out! My wife and I have come to Japan quite a few times for the fall colours but this year, the trees were still green. So I was looking for alternative outdoor sightseeing places and chanced on this Rose garden. The latest review was just a day ago the weekend and said the roses were in bloom.

Pleasant half hour walk from our hotel with a detour to buy umbrellas as it started raining. Nevertheless, the garden was lovely and the drops of water on the petals and leaves look really nice in the photos. Lots of variety and I think the name of the varietals were one tags under each plant.

The Rose garden is on an island and the views of the water is also great, as was walking on the bridges. It's really a nice park and it's good to retrace your steps as they're are new views of the roses from a different direction.

It was raining half way through our visit there but it was enjoyable nevertheless. We did take the subway back instead of walking though . A large rose garden in the middle of a major urban area. Whats there not to like? The different varieties are tagged with a little info like species, year developed and general type e.g. hybrid tea etc. but not much information beyond that. One section of the garden has roses developed by each decade 1900s, 1910s up to the 1950s. Other parts of the garden of course include roses developed after that. There are lots of benches and places to sit. This appears to be a nonorganic garden. Roses show signs of spraying so dont eat the roses This is a free public garden opened to all, right in the middle of the Tosahori river. As the weather was warm, the roses were still in bloom. There was a light shower when we arrived, and the rain drops on the roses created fantastic photography opportunities. The riverside landscape also has many interesting characters to provide plenty of photo ops.","Monday: Open 24 hours

I normally can't find it at all in tokyo, this really made my day today, kudos to him! The staff are very rude. Often get mad if we request more than one size or more than one model to try on, because i was planning to give a present for my family. None of them really helped the costumers.

The Japanese style is painful after overusing your knees. I am grateful that the air conditioning has been turned on since May. From now on, I would like to turn on the air conditioning so that I don't skimp on my electricity bill as we head into summer. It is now a vaccination site.
Some measures have been taken, such as restricting entry, but since the elevator is shared with the library and sports facilities on different floors of the building, staff should be placed near the elevator to limit the number of people, or other facilities should be closed. I thought.
I don't know if it's from Osaka City or Osaka Prefecture, but I can't deny that the filling is sweet.

After all, those who have been vaccinated will have priority now, right? I went to get the vaccine injection with my eldest son who is a student taking the exam. I arrived earlier than my scheduled appointment time, but the injection was only given at my scheduled appointment time.
I think it would be a good idea to arrive a little before your appointment time for the vaccine injection. The venue is on the 5th floor, and there is an elevator that takes you up to the elevator, but since there are only four people riding each, we had to wait in line for a while. I accompanied a child high school student to get vaccinated.
By the way, I was vaccinated at the SelfDefense Forces venue, so I can't help but compare it to the swift and smooth SDF venue, but overall the flow was poor.
I arrived 10 minutes before my reservation time, and it took about 50 minutes, including waiting time after vaccination.
Each person was kind and helpful, but it was still relatively new as a vaccination site, so even though there were a lot of staff, it felt a bit sluggish.
At the SelfDefense Force venue, if you knew in advance that it would be inconvenient to make a second reservation, you could change it on the spot, but in this case, you will have to call.
As a side note, those who had only brought their preexamination ticket and forgot their vaccination ticket were asked to reschedule their appointment. Please be careful not to forget anything. Visit a vaccination site.
Vaccinations will go directly to the 5th floor.
The 4th and 5th floors of Osaka Central Hall Community Center were the sports center, the 3rd floor was the library, and the 1st and 2nd floors were the Otoshiyori Health Center.
For those who don't use it regularly, it was a little difficult to understand the flow.","Monday: Closed

Fooddrinks when I say this was one of the best coffees I have ever had yall.. The way it feels in your mouth was just I dont even know how to explain but so smooth.

Atmosphere I came around 4pm and the place was not crowded at all. They only seem to have outside seating and have a little retail shop inside.
Service the staff was very nice with answering all of our questions and took care of us quite well.

Super convenient location close to Namba Station. There's an ice rink downstairs, a pool upstairs and sports gyms in the middle. Pretty much all sports are available to play from futsal to volleyball to badminton, etc. Would highly recommend this sports facility to anyone. Really great gym for 600 yen. If you don't bring a separate pair of shoes for the gym you will need to rent a pair from the 6F reception, of which the largest size was 29cm US 11.

Mainly machines  there's one set of barbells and one free weight bench press that can also be used for squats. 20 minute sessions can be reserved but you have to write your name on the queue sheet. Great small gym for a relatively cheap entrance fee. If you dont need a lot of special machines and heavy dumbbells, I can definitely recommend this place A bit more expensive than other swimming pools in Japan.  Seems that you can also use the gym with the entrance fee though. Very nice though that you can go swimming in the city center.  Great local experience with walking lanes  and different types of swimming lanes depending on your speed.
Opening hours do not always correspond with what is mentioned by google.  Better to check on their website if you understand Japanese or come before 5 pm. I went here for the small gym. Buy ticket on the 5th floor for 600 yen and hand it to the front desk on the same door for a plastic card and give it to the 6th floor staff thats where the gym is at. Besides some weight and cardio machines, they also have 1 squat rack and 1 smith machine with a 20 minutes timer and a waitlistqueue board to write your name down to use the rack.

While I was standing and leaned to the counter a little bit, waiting my family do the shopping upstairs, the arrogant and rude SA asked impolitely not to even I am not blocking or affecting anyone in this empty shop. This metal cashier counter is the noblest that cannot accept a pregnant womans slightly leanon and I would suggest Osaka shop put a sign beside to address its fragility. And the tanned SA is the worst person I have ever met in my three times visit to Japan. Great stuff and product but worse staff. They didnt allow you to buy the same size for same shirt at once, even you are coming to buy this with your friend. The worse part is, Im coming to this store twice a day to buy DIFFERENT THINGS, but they not allowed you to buy another reusable bag, she said one customer only eligible for buying this things once. What a weird rules The staff in this store are extremely terrifying. They are racist, have terrible attitudes, and their twofaced behavior is disgusting. I don't understand why this brand would hire such people to manage their store.There's no need to act this way and discriminate against nonJapanese people. Sales personal on the mens 2nd floor are very rude, my wife was waiting me on a couch they have on the mens area with a short she wanted , she put the short on the table they have in this area and this guy told her VERY RUDE to do not put the short there, we were about to buy several stuff for our kids and ourselves qnd because of this we decided not to do it, we have been in Japan traveling for 20 days and its the first time some we find someone rude like this guy. It was a very bad experience.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

There was a queue in front of the store and we thought it was the line to enter the shop. Suddenly, this rude staff tapped my husband's back and told us to leave! He said the store opens at 11. I told him, ok we will come back later, and ask whether this Atmos sells On Running shoes. He looked very upset and spoke to us loudly and in a very rude manner. He insisted for us to leave the premises, and this happened in front of everyone who was queuing. I even showed him google Translate so he understands what I meant!  It was clear that this staff didn't want our business at all. We left, went to Hankyu, found On Running, and bought 3 pairs worth around 60,000 JPY. All  the staff in Hankyu were very accommodating, polite, and very helpful! So, I am telling everyone reading this review, believe us and everyone giving this store a 1 star that it's all true about their rudeness, unhelpful, not polite manner, etc. Just go to another store where you will be treated the way you deserve. Don't let our experience happen to you and ruin your day. I think Atmos just hates foreigners. Otherwise, there is no way the owner will let employees like this still be employed. It's really funny how different this situation was to a department store like Hankyu, Hanshin, Daimaru, etc, where tourists will receive great service, a 5 discount, and a taxfree discount. Honestly, I am still confused if people still want to come to the store. Don't buy here. I get a pair of New balance and when I tried in the atore was okay, next day I used it and they felt really uncomfortable in the right side, it have like a rock, obviously from factory defect. The store didnt help me and they dont do changes. Just lost 150 usd because right side is impossible to use. Better buy it directly from the brand store If i can give zero  for reviews you will got that. Some of you doing like you dont want to sell any shoe. Never get any service like this. Bad place to looking for a good shoe.  Much easier to find sizes and rare kicks compared to their other locations. Dedicated staff especially with the store manager, Joseph who speaks fluent English. Nevertheless, the rest of the staff are friendly and helped me find a pair of nice Asics Japan only editions since it is tough for me to find a good fit with my flat feet. No doubt I would recommend any sneaker heads to come to this spot, all day! Good price, have my shoes size. Thank you","Monday: 10:30 AM – 8:30 PM

! A great shop to visit if you are looking for bouldering equipments, they have climbing shoes, clothes, and top rope equip. They import their equipments from spain definitely worth a trip down.

When I went to the store to exchange it for a better size they refused to exchange the merchandise because the price tag had been ripped. The item had never been used and I had a valid receipt. The staff were unapologetic and seemed indifferent even when I told them that I would never shop at their store again. You'd be much better off shopping elsewhere. Trekking goods of great quality. If you ever wanted to start hikingtrekking around Kansai without any previous experience or knowledge, this is the place to go. The staff here will help you choose your shoes, outfit, gear, and the best place to begin hiking. And it's so close to Umeda station. Just take a few minutes to stop by, and you'll definitely have a good start. Very well equipped shop and extremely prepared and available sales team. I guess it depends on the clerk, but I guess I didn't listen well or she seemed angry and it was hard to talk to her. I didn't end up making a purchase because I wanted to discuss various things. I thought other mountaineering equipment stores were more friendly. Exquisitely exciting mountaineering goods shop
There are core items as well as products from core manufacturers.
There's also the store staff's evaluation, but I'm sure if you ask, they'll give you a lot of advice, and if you don't ask, they'll leave you alone lol.
The shoe display looks like all the sizes that are out of stock are lined up, so I wonder how many of these shoes are in stock! I was surprised lol
It has a big impact and gets you excited.
North has a wide variety of apparel, including down jackets from Bartolo!
I have never seen a store with so many winter gear such as ice axes, crampons, waders, snowshoes, and shoes on display!
It was a truly core store.
I wish there was one in Kanto too.
They have created a store that you want to visit and see even if you don't have anything to do.

Ishii Sports came through with a really good range of outdoor shoes including larger sizes.  Very friendly and helpful staff as well! Among many bad reviews about staff here, I got the best service from a woman staff short hair woman staff. I went to find a pair of hiking shoes, she came and asked me if I have would like to try just let her know, she didn't even speak a word of english but trying to communicate with me by google translate. She was very polite and funny. I wish every staff could be like her. The employee at this store is the worst I have ever encountered in Japan, he is extremely rude! I asked him if I could try the jacket on and he ignored me. After being reminded by others, he finally unlocked the clothes. Yes, the clothes in this store are locked! The lock must be opened before you can try it on.

After trying it on, I found that the size was a bit small. I tried to ask the staff if they had a larger one, but he didnt even look at me. He rudely took the clothes away and said there were no more!Yes, he understands English, but he just doesnt want to service foreign guests! Then lock up the clothes again! To be honest, the first time I saw North Faces clothes were locked! Is this a luxury product?

The quality of the man was so poor, I saw other customers being turned away by his quality. I really had no interest in staying in this store anymore, so I had to leave! Its hard to understand why North Face would hire such unqualified employees!

If you do not want to service people who comes from overseas, please write a notice clearly at the door of your store and we will not enter your store!

This store doesnt even deserve any star The products in this store are satisfactory, and the female shopping guide who helps to try on shoes is also very polite. However, the man at the checkout mr.was extremely unprofessional and rude. His attitude was cold, he didn't use any polite words, and he deliberately glanced at foreign customers with hostile eyes. It was inexplicable. It was something we encountered during our tour in Osaka The only one with such poor service. Does the store intend to treat tourists from other countries differently? Bought a pair of shoes that did not fit well which I sadly only realized after a short walk. Came back to the store to change the pair but the staff refused to change them with another one since it was visible that I had tried them. However, it is worth noting that the shoes were still in perfect condition for selling.

This is not good customer service if you cannot try the items you bought and switch them if necessary. Will not go again.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

After signing up for membership, I was given a shoe bag and I also received a sports towel as a gift. The prices aren't much different from Korea, but there are a lot of different types of shoes, so it was nice to try on a lot of different things.

MONTURA Osaka,"Japan, 〒532-0011 Osaka, Yodogawa Ward, Nishinakajima, 1-chōme−12−４ クリヤマビルディング 1F",4.4,34.72535099999999,135.499568,"2023.11.1412.07
Sale has started again this year

2021.11.12 sale has started! o

Moved from Shinsaibashi to the 1st floor of the Nishinakajima headquarters building in October last year.
The store is spacious and spacious, with a wide selection of products, making it easier for customers to shop around. 

My personal recommendation is that the Yaru Techno GTX approach shoesIt's light and has good grip, so you can climb anywhere for 3 seasons with just one.

The newly released base layer is also quite good. I think it was made to imitate Millet and Fine Track, but this season's version is closer to Fine Track
However, when it feels soft and dry, I wonder, Oh, are you sweating?  and then it returns to a pleasant texture.

The pants are great too
Not only are they durable and water repellent, but they are also 3Dcut to suit your movements, and each pair of pants uses multiple fabrics with the right material in the right place.
And what I like about it is that the design and slim pants are cool

Other great items include merino shirts and fleece. Having the right material in the right place is a given, and for winter mountain climbing, focus on wind protection during the peak season and breathability during the peak season.

The drawback is the price, but cheaper versions and late models are often cheaper, so if you aim for those, it will be easier to experience highquality mountaineering wear!

This month 2021.10, there are several events in collaboration with JTB, and there is also a base layer gift  that is about the same as the participation fee o

I have to go buy everything for winter mountain climbing ov The store staff had great customer service and I was able to shop comfortably.
Although it is a little expensive, it is extremely comfortable to wear! We especially recommend pants.
Due to its location, you won't be able to stop by while shopping, but if you are interested in the outdoors, please give it a try. The shoes were carefully fitted. This is a valuable shop where you can try Montura and Fitwell. It was especially nice that they had Fitwell winter shoes.
Old model sales are also worth a look. I was able to actually try it on and the Montular was really nice. I heard that it's more expensive, but it's more durable and lasts a long time.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Great store with an incredible selection of sporting goods at very reasonable prices. Past seasons gear is almost always steeply discounted by at least 20!

Location is decent because its just a stones throw away from Abeno Harukas which is well connected by metro and bus services.

A real sports enthusiasts dream. Can easily spend one or two hours just browsing and hunting for bargains. Had my tennis racquet strung here.  A mistake was made in the string pattern  not enough cross strings were used.  The department head was extremely apologetic and refunded me my total bill plus an additional 2000 yen.  Amazing sense of accountability.  I will definitely continue to shop here.  Excellent customer service! This place is well stocked but otherwise the same as most Sports Depot. It's a little tricky to approach by car from the west or north because the entrance is on a road with a central divider. Check Google maps before driving there ! Good place to find your sporting goods, so many choice from different brands.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

I bought some hats, sweater, and merino wool baselayers which were quite lovely. Staff is okay and foreignerfriendly. Store clerk here is fantastic. I asked for a shoe size but he wasnt convinced and wanted to make proper measurements. Unfortunately, there was no more availability on the size I needed. I managed to purchase other hiking gear and merino wool products instead. No taxfree is fine but the when I didn't notice that, I think I can have time to think about it .But the clerk's attitude was so bad that almost yelling at ma and that made me feel angry and offended.  This is the worst shopping experience for me in Japan .
If you'd like to shopping in Montbell ,here may not be your best choice This Montbell location was the first and one of the largest locations Ive been to, huge selection including cycling gear. It does close earlier than other locations.

This is the only location out of 4 locations in Osaka that we visited that carried their cool rope sandals. Wonder if that was out of season as we were there in the winter. The staff is friendly. Also, my order arrived earlier than expected.","Monday: 10:30 AM – 8:30 PM

You can also buy cleats or other equipment. I bought two cushions and a clock from there We from Taiwan, we very happy to come youre shop but staff not friendly with us.
Every customer had have a staff  to serve, only we havent.
We want to brought football shoes for leather, we need to try and check size, all of staff say they are busy,  we came early than others Japanese customers.
No one can serve us, so we left.
That is a racism store. The whole store chain sucks! Both the Tokyo and Osaka stores have some random European club and national team jerseys but not Japanese! No matter which club, either they are out of stock or do not have enough sizes. One of the best places I found in Osaka, also nice to see the classic football shoes on the walls worn by famous football players , and the staff are amazing very friendly  helpful, and big thanks to KOKORO , amazing person , patient and polite, helped me to get 4 pairs of shoes , will go there definitely again whenever I visit Japan.  They only sell current and new models, you wont be able to find any past models.  Staff are nice and informative.

FJALLRAVEN STORE OSAKA ALBi,"Japan, 〒530-0001 Osaka, Kita Ward, Umeda, 3-chōme−1−３ ルクアイーレ 6F",4.3,34.7028363,135.494877,"Enough collection, excellent service for foreigner, and good simple english for communication I am here on May 19, 2024 at 300 p.m. I left the store at 300 p.m. The male clerk inside the store hair curly hair had a very unfriendly attitude toward foreigners, was extremely arrogant, and completely understood my own thoughts, slanderous questions, etc. Written by Rin and Tadashi, the Japanese customers in the store are completely unsuitable for the foreign staff in the meeting, and how the previous study is compared to the work done by the people who come back!

We went to the store at 3pm on May 19, 2024. The male clerk at the store curly hair had a very unfriendly attitude towards foreigners and was not willing to pay any attention to us. I think the right thing to do for these employees who are discriminatory against foreigners and only care about chatting with Japanese customers in the store is to learn some manners before coming to work. I have shopped at this store twice so far.
The male clerk serves customers very kindly and politely. When I purchased the backpack, I was given detailed product explanations and care instructions.
I met the female store clerk maybe the store manager? both times when I went to make purchases, and both times she made me feel bad about something. It's only handled by one or two staff members, so I can understand why people get annoyed when they're being rushed around, but I think they should stop talking to customers in a condescending way... This is my personal feelingopinion... When the person who was with me heard the way the female store clerk spoke, she said, I felt disgusted and angry.I don't want to shop at a store like that.'' It was located at the ""LUCUA OUTDOOR from ALBi"" corner on the 6th floor of LUCUA. We have a full lineup of classic Kanken bags. They also do original processing.First of all, when you look at the product selection, the customer service filled with hospitality will make you decide. This store has a lot of styles, and I happily bought two bags to give away. As a result, the clerk used the wrong card and charged more than 200,000 yen. She also apologized. I understand that this was accidental, but the subsequent purchases were It was so small that she didnt remind her... nor did she put it in the bag... only to find it was gone when she got in the car... it was later confirmed that the clerk had placed it in the bag

The above has been confirmed by a friend who told me that it has been found on the ground floor. Thank you to the store for your considerate and patient reply. I would like to apologize to the store! There may be misunderstandings due to language barriers. I am sorry and thank you.","Monday: 10:30 AM – 8:30 PM

Snow board shop Lead Osaka,"2-chōme-1-4 Shikitsuhigashi, Naniwa Ward, Osaka, 556-0012, Japan",3.4,34.657281,135.5021226,"Not sure what is up with all the disgruntled japanese reviews here but I guess if you are a foriegner you don't get the same issue as they can't talk much. I bought the warmest most pimpin jacket here that saved my holiday and kept me toasty warm and dry for my week. It was pure joy getting such a warm jacket after being so cold and finding only pissy little options around osaka. The clerk and me had a language barrier but he knew a few words and was friendly and smiley enough. I would give 5 stars but the issue I had was although they have 2 prices on the tags taxno tax I still paid full price. There was no receipt given for a 300 dollar jacket. Just a card payment slip. I didn't realise until I got home that I was not able to claim a considerabe amount of tax as they gace no reciept or assistance in the matter. That was my only issue This is the second time contact. I bought Burton snowboard step on shoes Ritual black color on Oct 223 and never use it. I just found out that the left size is 245 while right size is 240. I would like to change to 240 size. Can we exchange this. I will be in Tokyo in Jan202123. Really cool store amazing set up and immaculate vibe the music was great and I didn't mind the trains passing overhead to top it off great products but staff were so unfriendly I kept waiting for some kind of greeting or service I wanted to buy something but I just felt so unwelcome Not much choices and variety to buy.

Location is far from Shinsaibashi. Found an outdoor store near Namba, Osaka
Mainly skiingsurfing. The store is very large and has a wide range of varieties 
As soon as I entered the door, I saw neatly arranged snowboards of different lengths and patterns.
The pattern is super nice! Snow suits, armor, helmets, goggles, bindings, ski boots and various accessories, ski warm gloves, masks, there are several cabinets full of them. You can really get it all in one step. It is more comprehensive than the outdoor products store I went to before.

The store clerks are also very professional. You can try on snow clothes and snowshoes. It doesnt matter if you are a novice. The store clerks will help you get it done. However, it may be because of the location that there are almost no tourists. In terms of language, it should only be in Japanese

Japanese people really like outdoor sports. Skiing, surfing and golf are their daily sports. The equipment is also very complete. You can try it out and choose the one that suits you Party R","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

There are only a few outlet products at the end of the store, and the rest are regular products.

The idea is to investigate for yourself. There seemed to be no attachment to the product, which made me even more disappointed.

Not a fan that smoking is permitted in the small bar but the owner, Yogi, is super friendly, social and willing to accommodate most requests! Dropped into this bar late, and the owner was very friendly.  Made sure I tried Fiji beer, something you cannot get in the states.  A once in a lifetime chance unless you fly to Fuji.  Great bar to pass the time, and especially great bar to watch Rugby! A family run sports bar in Osaka with a huge drink selection and amazing homemade food! We popped in to watch the RWC semifinal and the atmosphere was amazing. It is a great place to meet people from different nationalities and very welcoming. 5 stars! Beautiful owner who takes care of his customers.  This place is often filled with both regulars and newcomers.
The bar offers a vast selection of Fijian beer, rum, and the like, as well as cocktails and Japanese selections.   The food menu compliments to drinks well.
Though I am not a big rugby fan, this place isn't very intimidating being that this is a rugby themed place.  Both the owner and his patrons are very welcoming. Came here during the 2019 world cup and had to come back in 2023 when visiting Osaka with my family. Really friendly place with a great atmosphere. Also the place to go if you want to catch a rugby game.",no operation time,"bar, point_of_interest, liquor_store, store, establishment"

Long day, walking back to the hotel, happens to be Tuesday. What's this a Taco place? And what a Taco place. I live amongst a large Mexican American population at home so I have no shortage of good tacos and love to try the local fair when traveling. These do not disappoint, amazing, home made Salsa was great to boot. If you are craving a Taco in Osaka I doubt you are going to find better you might not find better back home either. Really great place, amazing friendly staff, and a great bar to just wind down and enjoy a drink and a cigarette. The nachos are decently good , but the tacos are pretty amazing. They're essentially tacos dorrados, combine with the salsa and cholula sauce, and this pairs great with the alcohol.  Got my hispanic Texan approval. Excellent tacos! Slightly small, as it's only one taco for 800yen, I had 2 and they were really good. The bar has a good atmosphere and friendly local regulars.

The seats are benches with storage for your bags and jackets to not get the smoky smell. The workers make the okonomiyaki in front of you and thoroughly warn you not to touch it until its ready. We got the B set, the butter soy sauce scallops, and takoyaki for 3 ppl and was quite filling. Highly recommend the set and the takoyaki. This place is the real deal Holyfield!. We arrived around 445 pm, and waited for an hour. I usually wouldnt wait on a queue, but I have to say it was worth it. This was the best meal we had in Japan.We ordered the fried noodle , and the Ajinoyas mix okonimiyaki. Do yourself a favor and order both. Wowwwwww Showed up on a Saturday around lunch time and was seated in less then 30min. Google doesnt show the precise location but if you see a line heading to 2nd floor you arrived. Staff takes order while you wait in line. Food is prep fresh in front of you. I tried the yakisoba and it was delicious and the regular portion was very generous. They serve you water in case you dont want a drink. Highly recommended!! Cash only! We made reservations, but there was no way to differentiate walk ins from reservations so make sure you walk up too regardless of the line if you have reservation. We almost missed ours waiting in the line.
The okonomiyaki is pretty filling. We ordered two to share and couldn't finish it all. We prefered the seafood to the bacon. Place opened at 11am. Got there at 1030am on a Tuesday morning and was third in line. Got the mixed okonomiyaji with beef octopus and corn with every sauce offered. This was so damn good. We also ordered the negiyaki and the beef and octopus yakisoba which were both equally delicious. Pro tip if you let it sit on the grill for a bit, you get some nice crispy caramelized noodle pieces which are awesome. Definitely recommended but try to get there early to cut the wait cuz you'll still have to wait. There's a sign at the end of the queue that says 90minutes so heads up on that.","Monday: Closed

I am a Muslim revert and had tried nonhalal Japanese food before. This restaurant is authentically Japanese. We had the waygu set, and it was scrumptious! Muslim or not, everyone should come here. The staff were extremely friendly and spoke good English! We will definitely be back in the future! Absolutely amazing food, the wagyu cubes are one of the best meats iv ever tried in my life. Staff are so nice and accommodating and the pricing is very reasonable for the exceptional quality. Highly highly recommend this place oh and it's halal! Hands down the best Wagyu I've had! This is one of the few halal Wagyu restaurants in Japan, and it's better if you book in advance. At the time we went, there was already a crowd waiting outside, thankfully we've made our reservations earlier.

We ordered the biggest cut of the A5 Wagyu set. The beef melts in my mouth! The saucemarinade they prepared was also delicious, which went well with the beef. Even though the food is halal, they also serve alcohol here.

The staff was efficient and served us promptly. This was probably one of the food highlights of my trip in Osaka. Honestly, this place was for sure 1010. The meat was really tender and super tasty. They give everything hot and they bring everything to super fast. The customer service was amazing, they were super kind and also was super interactive with us. Only issue you might have when visiting here is the place is always packed so make sure to make reservations, if ur lucky you might able to come in if theres an empty spot. This was the most incredible experience we had. Nothing compares to how good this meat is! It has ruined all other food for us! The service was wonderful too. Such lovely friendly staff.

Every dish ordered was fresh and delicious. Hummus with pita was incredible and the schwarma plate was out of this world. Combining both dishes with pita and hummus was a winning combination. Reasonably priced and the owner, Ali is an amazing person. His restaurant is professionally run and he has taken the time to understand Japanese culture and accommodates all patrons. I recommend anyone visiting Osaka to try out the food here if they want a change of pace from the food normally served in larger Japanese cities. It was truly an experience. Had lunch today, set meal chicken biriyani came with a free drink, I chose hot coffee. Food was good, place is a bit cramped but this is expected in Japan. Good food, great value for money. Server girls were very polite
Stairs are very steep, but can take lift Ali's Kitchen in Osaka was a bit disappointing, to be honest. The food was okay, nothing really stood out, and considering the prices, I expected more. If you're in the mood for a memorable meal, you might want to explore other places in Osaka instead. The food wasn't so bad but the spices were too much more than the rice, also they used too much oil in all dishes no dry tissues on any of the tables the place was cozy and warm they are good welcoming with a good smile Promoting HalalFriendly, Kyoto, Osaka

Ali's Kitchen

On my third day in the area, I finally had the chance to visit the renowned Ali's Kitchen, and I'm so glad I did. From the moment I stepped through the doors, I was enveloped in a warm, inviting atmosphere that set the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.

This establishment's accolades are welldeserved, as evidenced by its Trip Advisor Excellence award for several consecutive years and the prestigious Michelin star it has been awarded. These distinctions prove the uncompromising commitment to quality and the extraordinary culinary talent permeating every aspect of Ali's Kitchen.

The show's true stars were the dishes I enjoyed sampling. The mixed beef and mutton Tikka was an absolute delight, earning a welldeserved 4star rating from me. The expertly seasoned and grilled meats were a flavour revelation, accompanied by perfectly paired sauces that enhanced the experience.

However, the true standout was the Mutton Biryani, which I would unhesitatingly rate a full five stars. This dish's depth of flavour was astounding, with the tender, aromatic meat complemented by a perfectly spiced and fragrant rice blend. It was a culinary masterpiece that left me utterly captivated.

While the milk tea didn't quite reach the same lofty heights, with a 3star rating from me, it was still a refreshing and enjoyable accompaniment to the meal.

If you find yourself in the area, visiting Ali's Kitchen should be on your list!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Halal Ramen Naniwaya,"2-chōme-7-22 Nishishinsaibashi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0086, Japan",4.4,34.6696639,135.4981661,"I was recommended to come here by a friend from Australia,  as she knew I was vegetarian.  Trying thr vegetarian spicy ramen and the vegetarian spring rolls, they were amazing and was very well priced for what I ordered.  I also got the matcha ice cream desert. Definitely need to buy this item after your meal. If your in Osaka and vegetarian,  please try this place out. One of the better halal options in Japan. A few of the other places I have been are overated but this was spot on. It's a shame I only found this place on my last day here but definitely worth a try.
Service was prompt, nice calm environment and we weren't rushed.

Food was a little pricier than other options but in line with other halal places we have been, so overall not bad for what you get.

I felt the portions sizes were good and it was easy to find. Customer service needs much improvement, it's missing the usual Japanese warmth and hospitality my experience as follows  One staff assigned me one table, in a min another staff came and requested me to move to another table My ordered Wagyu Steak was being served on another table before I drew attention of the staff Requested drink was served with ice whereas I clearly mentioned not to put ice in it due to cold Had to wait at the counter a min before someone came to settle the bills completely confused about my table number...
Food was decent, nothing exceptional though. However, I don't recommend the Gyoza, it was deep fried and too dry.
The restaurant was spacious enough for a group.
The wait time was short too even during the busy lunch hour. The rice bowl was amazing. Wagyu bowl rice and chicken curry rice was delicious.
Opt for set with karaage and drinks ice cream.
Clean place and quite spacious.
However need sometime to take the waiter attention for ordering.
Maybe during that time short of manpower.
But this is one of the halal food recommended for those who come to Osaka Impressed with the halal ramen taste here. Especially cos the chicken is like charcoal grilled so its really tasty. Wagyu ramen is good too just that cos the meat is shredded you cant really tell its wagyu, or just tender meat. Then we got wagyu steak slices which are amazing. It literally jiggles. However restaurant aircon is not good and it was summer and we were just sweating while eating. Toilet had some issues too.","Monday: 12:00 – 9:30 PM

Hanadako,"Japan, 〒530-0017 Osaka, Kita Ward, Kakudachō, 9−２６ 大阪新梅田食道街 １階",4.3,34.7031557,135.497981,"Hanadako is a popular takoyaki shop located in the Osaka New Umeda Shokudogai, conveniently situated next to the train station. The shop constantly attracts crowds of people eager to enjoy their delicious takoyaki.

You have the option to dine in or take out, with takeout typically being faster. For dinein, youll have to wait until seats are available. The seating is limited to a small standing counter that accommodates 89 people. After placing your order, you can enjoy your takoyaki while watching the chef skillfully prepare them, creating a lively atmosphere.

We ordered 10 takoyaki for just 1050 yen, which is very affordable. The takoyaki comes topped with a generous amount of green onions and mayonnaise, forming a literal mountain of toppings. The takoyaki themselves are delicious  crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside, with tender, chewy octopus pieces. You can also add chili powder which isnt too spicy for an extra kick, transforming the flavor in a delightful way.

Overall, this is a highly recommended spot, and its clear why its so popular! A famous Takoyaki shop in this area. There are quite a few people, but the wait is not too long. There is a counter bar in front of the shop where you can eat. The price is not expensive, but to be honest, the taste is not much different from other shops. This place has queue all the time. Nice and big tokoyakis. I enjoyed until the last bite. They have only 4 places for dine in and its standing only. You can also takeaway. We came around lunch time, and there was a queue. We waited around 1520 minutes and it was our turn to order. Dine in space was limited, with only standing space available.

BUT IT WAS WORTH IT! We ordered 6 pieces of the takoyaki loaded with chives and mayo, and it was delicious. Its definitely worth queueing and eating! Would highly recommend it! Really good takoyaki  the line went fast, if you do take out.
You can really feel and taste the octopus
Super good value for money!
The only thing to know is that you need to walk a bit around to eat it, as you cannot stay there","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The fish was so fresh that it melted in your mouth and the wagyu beef was unbelievable. We didnt speak any Japanese but we managed to communicate with the lovely staff through a fun game of charades. Also the sale was delicious. Great value for such a beautiful meal. Excellent izakaya. Hard to reserve as they dont speak English, but well worth the effort, excellent sashimi, mushroom tempura, sardines and other fish dishes. Super helpful service, despite the language barrier. He who dares, wins! If you dare go in here as a foreigner, bring your love for the cuisine and some understanding of the language and the patrons will make sure you have a great meal. Everything in this place is well thought out, from the pottery to the dishes. Well balanced, very high quality and great ambiance. A true, somewhat fancy, izakaya experience. This review is strictly for their customer service that I received over the phone. I haven't tried this restaurant because they refused to take a reservation. They were very rude to us over the phone. We were willing to take any time available but we got a simple no. I got the impression that they are picky with selecting their customers. I would assume that this is due to their popularity.  very good food

Hes a poet. Hes very skilled in his profession. The personalized touches he adds to the restaurant like artwork makes this place so much more appreciated. The food was gastronomical, tasty, creative and so perfect! We loved our experience here. Sake pairing was amazing! If you have the chance, this is 100 worth it. We were SO full at the end we could barely breathe! Hajime is one of the top restaurants my partner and I have been to. We travel the world and always make it a point to go to 3 Michelinstarred restaurants, and to say this was, by far, our favorite, would be an understatement. The atmosphere is moody and romantic. The service staff is absolutely exceptional. Each individual goes above and beyond to make sure you're enjoying your stay. The menu was so delicious and intentional. Each menu title corresponded perfectly with its meal. My husband and I are celebrating our honeymoon with 3 weeks in Japan and to say the staff went out of their way to show us love would be an understatement. We will 100 be coming back, and will recommend to any and every person to make a trip to Osaka just to come to Hajime.

Thank you, Hajime, and Etsu our server extraordinaire for making this my favorite dining experience!!! And thank you for getting us out quickly and safely, when we almost missed our train back to Kyoto. Just a year and a half after opening in 2008, Hajime achieved 3 Michelin stars for excellence in French cuisine  the fastest rise in recorded history. After they transitioned to creative cuisine in 2012, Hajime was awarded 3 Michelin stars again in 2017.

The restaurant has a tasting menu with 3 price levels 60,500 minimalist version, 67,100 with vegan ingredients, and 71,500 as their standard menu. My mom and I chose the Tasting Menu Standard at 71,500 price excludes 15 service charge per person.

The restaurant is founded and run by Chef Hajime Yoneda. There are those who follow the crowd, and there are those who take the road less traveled and find their own success. Like Mr. Hajime Yoneda, he dared to do something different  choosing to quit his highpaying job as a design engineer at the age of 26 to become a chef. His years of hard work paid off when he was awarded 3 Michelin stars in 2009  all in just 17 months  a feat that no other restaurant in the world has achieved so quickly.

The dining experience at Hajime is like a culinary art. Having eaten at many Michelinstarred restaurants before, I always had high expectations, but the food here really overwhelmed me. The moment you step into the minimalist room, the darkness makes everything very mysterious. Chef Hajimes creations are not only well conceived but also well executed, truly worthy of 3 Michelin stars. The art based cuisine is very sophisticated and the featured dish Planet Earth has a range of ingredients that I never imagined coming together but wow  its incredible. Definitely a worthwhile experience and one that you will remember. I had the pleasure of experiencing Hajime dining with my mother.

82,225  1 person  13 million VND US510 Hajime artistically executes an innovative dining experience that takes people on a journey across the earth, exploring the abundance of oceans, rivers, skies and fields.

This is a mustvisit destination for anyone visiting Japan. My husband and I were treated to a wonderful evening for our 10th anniversary.

Thank you Chef Hajime Yoneda, Etsu, and the entire team for the privilege of dining here. We will remember this experience of a lifetime! Arigatou gozaimasu. Worldclass restaurant. It is deserving of its three Michelin stars. Service was impeccable.

Id let the pictures and videos speak for this exquisite gastronomic experience. Be prepared to be blown away by the flavours and the philosophy all at the same time.

The entire course runs for over three hours, and there is so much to consume, so come prepared with an empty stomach. Id recommend the short pairing option, which covers the starters to the main course. It was just the right amount of alcohol and liquids in general to help you get through the course. I imagine youd be bloated if you took the half or standard pairing 

Last but not least, this was the New Years
menu, so it was extra pricey. Was it worth it? Yes, it is genuinely an allrounded dining experience.","Monday: 5:00 – 11:00 PM

We just happened to find this because we are staying in Royal Park Iconic Osaka hotel. Its light jazzy type music, low lighting and friendly greeting as you arrive is so warm and cozy. But the food is out of this world. Weve only been to two other Teppanyaki restaurants in Japan so far but this is the best by far! Food is so fresh and delicious. Personnel is professional, and quick and helpful! Even though we do not speak Japanese. They were understanding and accommodating. English menu and made sure the ingredients were okaywhat we wanted for each course. The food is high quality and filling. Go there hungry and you wont be disappointed. P.s. steak was so good we forgot to take a photo of that. Exquisite dining and lunching. Best steak we ever had. Also amazing starters and Japanese curry.
We tried both Kobe beef and a tenderloin stake, and I honestly cannot say which one was better they were very different, but were both of the highest quality and cooked to perfection.
If I am ever back to Osaka, Rio will be on my absolute mustvisit list.
Not to mention the great service and beauty of the place, but of course the standards are already high on Japan.
And last important point to mention you can go for the most expensive option on the menu like we did for one person, but cheaper versions are are also amazingly delicious and of highest quality. So value for money in RIO is also above charts  Had an amazing culinary experience on my wife's birthday, chef Ishikawa was an absolute delight as both a host and our personal chef, not a single dish was anything but great if I had the space I'd do the whole meal again! Kobe Teppanyaki Rio is amazing. Located in the foyer of the Royal Park hotel, my partner and I went for lunch on our last day in Osaka.
We were greeted by lovely staff with great English and an English menu.
The chef introduced themself, greeted us and then cooked us one of the best steaks we have eaten. They even told us when to get the camera ready for the flame to sear the steaks. We had the set lunch steak, salad, rice and soup and washed it down with a nice glass of Red.

Definitely recommend trying out this restaurant. The price was very reasonable as well.
Thank you team. Visited in November 2023, and it was really an amazing place to try kobe beef for the first time! The chef knew what he was doing and gave us a little performance. So far a superb experience. Will be back if I go to Osaka!","Monday: 11:30 AM – 3:00 PM, 5:30 – 10:00 PM

I cannot sound my amazement of the process since this is my first Kaiseki experience. The chefs are making food in front of you yes we're by the counter by choice.

Got the dishes, tasted our first Fugu, desserts were great, the food were pretty, tasted good, we're full because it has proper main dish, all of it are really amazing.

We reserved from our hotel concierge a day before so you can try that too. Really good. Went because of the raving reviews. Did not reserve so went at 5.15pm. Place starts getting busy at about 6.15pm. Husband does not eat sashimi but the chefs were accommodating. Fabulous end with the jelly in black sugar syrup and soy flour.

Experience legitimised and affirmed by the constant flow of elders aged 45 and above, and you would agree this is a strong sign of the authencity of traditional cuisine. The restaurant usually full and recommend make reservation. An open kitchen concept and able to watch crews working. We order the second highest price omakase set. Sake taste good. The set was amazing and cooked with care and good presentation. Fabulous meal end with wonderful dessert. Server was friendly and explained each dish while serving. Ownerchef came and said hello to us. Considering the quality of food, services and the ambiance, it was a value for money. 2023 Still, without a doubt, my favorite dining experience in Osaka.

2020 This is my happy place in Osaka. Carefully prepared food, phenomenal service. The staff really takes care of you.

I sometimes get the courses, love love the maguro, tempura, lotus root dumpling and scallops. Don't be afraid to ask for recommendations even if your Japanese is embarrassingly basic like mine. Have Dassai sake with fish, if you can.

Sit at the counter, order a yuzu liqueur with soda and watch the welloiled machine at work. I couldnt make a reservation so went at 500 pm. Had the shortest Omakaze but still 7 dishes, 8800 yen and it was very fresh and delicious. The staff explained the cuisine very kindly in English. A lot of seafood menu interpreted into Osaka style. It was open kitchen, very interesting to watch the cooks including the owner chef working to make the best dishes.","Monday: 5:00 – 11:00 PM

We had to wait a bit, as they were short staffed due to illness, but it was absolutely worth the wait. We ordered the smashed avocado with bacon, that was cooked to perfection with a slightly runny yolk. The almond chai latte and flat white were excellent, and the atmosphere was fun and trendy, with relaxedchill music.
Colin, the owner, was super lovely and even gave us lots of tips for bars in Osaka and for our next stop in Kyoto. Highly recommend giving it a try! A great little breakfastbrunch place. Relaxed atmosphere and really great service. The chai latte is fantastic, be careful with that first sip though, nearly competed in the cinnamon challenge when I accidentally breathed in . The bread is great here, got the full rugby and the portions are indeed for a rugby player.  If you are looking for great portions for your dollar that's an excellent choice. Tons of fresh veg. Can't recommend it enough, worth a stop. Visited from Georgia, USA and found this place on a whim near our hotel since we wanted coffee and a healthy snack. This place does not disappoint! Amazing food and a more amazing staff! Im beyond grateful for their hospitality and recommend this place! Vibe was cozy and chill nice playlist and the staff were super friendly. My coffee was nice and strong yet super smooth. My wife and kids had smoothies and they were delicious too. A little thinner than what we are use to but rest assured nothing went to waste.
My kids have food allergies and they took the time to make sure what we ordered was safe for them to eat. We went with scrambled eggs over toasted gluten free toast with smoked salmon, sauted veggies with smashed avocado for the kids and egg, cheese and tomato toasties for my wife and I.
All the food was delicious and we are already planning to come back tomorrow for breakfast.
 Very relaxed place with a lighthearted fun ambience, incredibly friendly service, and the food is incredible. I love ham and sausage, so I went with ""The Full Rugby"", and it far surpassed expectations.

Okonomiyaki Mizuno,"1-chōme-4-15 Dōtonbori, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0071, Japan",3.8,34.6683548,135.5032226,"Absolutely delicious and worth the wait.

I lined up for about 35 minutes at lunch time, which I think is typical for this restaurant. As other reviewers have noted, you make your order in the queue and can't add more once you're inside. But if you know these things ahead of time, it's definitely worth a visit. I got a mini sized okonomoyaki and it was enough to fill me up, but if you're not sure, I'd suggest ordering any of the full size dishes.

They are very efficient and start cooking your meal before you get to your seat, but they will finish it off in front of you. Nice to find an oknomiyaki place that offer vegetarian option. You can even add noodle to your oknomiyaki. Queue is decent when we visit. You will have to place your order while in the queue. Once you are seated, you cant add order. Level 1 is counter seating. Level 2 has tables and suit for 36 persons. Service at level 1 seems to be better than level 2. Level 2 staff is just trying to rush to cook your food and serve it to you. Maybe the heat of cooking plus serving isnt something they enjoy. Food wise, pretty tasty food. Only thing I dont understand, they cook raw food with fully cooked food on the same hot plate and close together. OSAKA! A michelin recommended Okonomiyaki Osaka pancake. They have a lot of options!! But! We need to order everything while waiting, cant order anything more after we get in. So we ordered a lot,  but we just wanted to try.

We chose 3 signature pancakes, and one fried noodles. These I recommend. They make it in front of you. The atmosphere is hard to say because its a street food kind.

For 2 people, I think 2 pancakes are totally enough. Because takeout doesnt taste good. Luckily, we were able to get the table right away around 3pm. We have high expectation given the restaurant has got Michellin guide for so many years! Unfortunately, it was not as exceptional as many reviews said. The Okonomiyaki itself is decent freshlycooked right in front of us and ingredients used are fresh, but personally I think the taste is not that rich. I firstly know this restaurant from Drama Kodoku no Gurume Solitary Gourmet, on Netflix. Now, this restaurant has won Michelin recommendations on consecutive years and thus becomes super popular. It always has a line outside.
I waited for 30 mins around. Staff will give you a menu and take your order when you are in the line. Note that you cannot order more food once inside, so you need to decide and order everything you want while in line you can still order drink once being seated.
I tried two mini size okonomiyaki.
Yamaimo Okonomiyaki, which is completely flourless since it made of yamaimo mountain yam. You can have to ur own protein option and I chose pork belly. I see they roasted pork belly on both side, and add batter onto it. Once done, its served with their special sauce, mustard, and mayonnaise. It was so delicious! Chewy, savory, sweet, every single bite is packed with flavor and texture.
Mizuno okonomiyaki, which is their signature dish, consists of various protein that cooked together with batter and served with their special sauce, mustard, and mayonnaise. Its still good but I would say yamaimo okonomiyaki definitely wins.
For yamaimo okonomiyaki, a 30min wait is fine, but anything longer than 45 mins would be a disaster under summer weather.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Deliciously spicy Sri Lankan food. Great staff. Well worth a visit. I would give a 5 stars for this restaurant. I wasn't much educated of Sri Lankan cuisine so I always asked for recommendations from them. They always find out my liking of meat and recommended me the dish. Not only that they also educated me how to actually eat it to get the best flavors of their dishes. The good is very good and totally blew me out. Maybe a little spicy for a lot of people but trust me it's worth a try. The service is impeccable here, the hospitality and the friendliness is really something that's really worth it. I will go back for more. I have been to this place of and on for the past couple of years.
The food has been consistently great.
To his time though due to the rise in popularity in Sri Lankan cuisine I think the owners are getting carried aware a bit.
I ordered the 1500 lunch and treated myself to an additional chicken curry.
My fault I did not ask the price of the additional curry but 1200 for two pieces of chicken drumsticks!!! Then I expect the curry to blow my mind or at least have white table cloths when you serve a small curry for that price.!!! It feels like daylight robbery I could have paid 200 more and had a second plate of whole lunch.
I guess Ceylon curry beats them anytime. The meal was a little on the expensive side, however it was completely worth it for the massive amount of flavour in every bite. Highly recommend the boar or mutton and a Sri Lankan ginger beer. The food is very spicy which is AWESOME. This my first time eating Sri Lankan cuisine and has given me an excellent first impression! The most authentic Srilankan meal Ive had. Everything was fresh, the quality was incredible, and The staff are the friendliest people.

The service ended with coffee and tea, a delightful meal indeed The dinner dishes are really good. My friend and I ordered the dinner course with red wine. The price is reasonable with the food quality. All staff are friendly and really nice to explain all the plates that we ordered. The restaurant environment is cozy. English menu is not available but staff are kindly help to order the food The food was as expected but not exceptional. The price of the set menu was also amenable and not too pricey.
The service, though, was not as i expected for a french bistro. Servers were not as attentive as I'd like them to be. Since it was our anniversary dinner, picked out the oldest and most trusted bistro in Osaka. Unfortunate, but nonetheless we had a good time. Good place for light eating, the food has fine dining vibe but I think the place is more interesting for people who would enjoy drinking In Osaka for 2 weeks and sampling the French restaurants in the area. So far, the Bistrot dAnjou is the winner. Add the duck for lunch with a carafe of red. This just hit the spot. Loved it. Glad to see the restaurant busy at noon.","Monday: Closed

Love it and will definitely return!!

Couple things to note
1 Standing only
2 Have to queue
3 All Japanese menu so do take note.. translate app DOES NOT do the menu justice!!! Just bring a friend that can read Japanese!  We went here during the rush hour on our second day in Osaka. So calculate to wait a bit when u came arround 800 pm. The waiter was kind, the atmosphere as I expected, great! This feeling, you go in the Metro station and there is a whole street of restaurants and bars and people drink, eat, smoke and enjoy life is great. The food was damn good. I went here because of a youtuber Lukas and I really need to say he made a good job! It was the best fresh made fry chicken I had in Japan so far still some days left. Also the raw beef was great. I can really recommand that place. And you should order a Saporo  good beer in Japan  This spot is a legend. Standing izakaya with outrageously delicious food for great prices. It is clearly loved by locals. Good for a quick hangout , roast beef , katsuo tataki and tofu  recommend, Came here on the recommendation of one of my japanese friends, and had absolutely no regrets. It is slightly difficult to order because there is no english menu, and the patrons are mostly local. But we managed fine with google translate. Kind of want to gatekeep this, because the quality of the food is far beyond what they are charging. My favourites are the beef tataki, fried shrimp, and the fried oysters. However, everything on the menu is good. Will definitely be revisting next time im in osaka.","Monday: 2:00 – 10:30 PM

But honestly,  as a Michelin 2 starred restaurant, I do expect more variety on their wine list....
Understand nothingno one can gain everyone's heart, not even GOD, but the Japanese white wine i'd order is really really NOT my favour.... like drinking perfume...

Not sure if i am too picky p , the lady serving my table seems urging me to order wine even when I am still discussing with my hubby whether to order a bottle,  by glass or wine pairing set,  this part can improve.

Overall, I do recommend to give a try q A place truly worthy of Michelin stars! The dishes are wonderful, a course menu with Spanish and Japanese influence using the best ingredients from parts of Japan. The staffs are also attentive and informative, and the chef is very friendly and is willing to send everyone back home safely after finishing the meal. Had high expectations for this restaurant because of its Michelin rating. Upon our arrival, we were welcomed into a small dimly lit waiting area with 2 other parties. The seats were an awkward height to the table, and the space was not all that comfortable of the tight quarters. We noticed the party next to us had a guest wearing casual jeans and a hoodie, but the restaurant didnt seem to mind. The hostess brought out welcome drinks for the party next to us, and ours didnt arrive until 5 minutes later, even though we all arrived at the same time. We werent actually seated in the restaurant until 10 mins later, when we were led up the stairs, passing the chefs who welcomed us on the way in. The restaurant is a renovated apartment building, beautifully designed with 45 tables per floor. We sat at our table for another 10 min before we were finally served water, and the first part of dinner seemed like the staff was playing catch up because they seated too many tables at the same time. Service was polite,  but not particularly personable, and everyone spoke English well. Food was actually quite delicious, although Im not sure I saw any Spanish influence in particular. The Chef had trained in Modena, Italy and a wasabi pasta in particular was excellent. The menu was very fallinspired we loved the airy pumpkin bread, the toasted brown rice risotto, and the roasted chestnuts that really invited all senses into the Japanese countryside. There was also a few seafood presentations from Hokkaido such as an Amberjack that was beautifully plated, just lightly seared. At the end of the night, one of the chefs walked us out and gave us a very warm send off. For a 2 star restaurant it used to have 3, Fujiya is very reasonable priced, and the food is simple and delicious. It is unfortunate that the night did not start off the same way it ended. For a 2 michelin starred restaurant the price you're paying is considered reasonable per say. I made my reservation 2 months in advance. Reservations are a must as the restaurant has really limited seats. I requested for a more private table and they gave me what I asked for. The staff were really friendly and service was excellent. The dining experience itself was exceptional and the chef himself Fujiwarasan came and served us the main course. Nestled between two buildings with a discrete entrance, Fujiya 1935 is a Three Star Michelin restaurant serving contemporary European influenced dishes prepared with seasonal Japanese ingredients. The interior of the restaurant is elegant and understated with a minimalist decor accentuated by natural lighting. Dishes are expertly cooked and presented beautifully. Service was flawless, with staff taking the time to explain each course in detail. Most surprising of all was the fact that Chef Fujiwara personally came by to talk to us at the end of the service to ask us about our experience. For us, Fujiwara 1935 represents a musttry for those in the Osaka area. Unlike many establishments of this calibre, we found the experience to be warm and inviting offering a personal connection between the food and the establishment.","Monday: 12:00 – 1:00 PM, 6:00 – 8:00 PM

Prices were reasonable with unlimited cold tea available to help beat the heat. The unagi was incredibly tasty  get it! Dont be deterred by the long line. It moves fairly quickly. Not many options on the menu but you don't need it. Get what they're known for. This is paradise for seafood enjoyers. You will wait in line but its worth it. They manage the line well. You will also share a table with someone and be standing up. Also worth it. Toyo does a cool thing with a torch, ice water, and tuna chunks. We've all seen the tiktok. Luckily its not just for the show, the food is killer. Although the wait was about an hour long in hot and humid weather, the wait was worth it since the fatty tuna very delicious. The lean tuna and the tuna cheek stirfry were also delicious but not as good as the fatty tuna. The grilled eel roll was also yummy and full of flavor. Beware that the tuna cheeks take a while to cook but it's worth trying at least once. It was my dream to get to meet him and not only did I get to do that and get a selfie and see his performance, but the food is truly remarkable. He is so hospitable and does a performance regularly for all of the diners. Honestly worth the wait, but I didnt more than 10 minutes. I arrived at 1230 and got a table quickly. The fresh tuna sushi and sashimi were delicious, and the creamy sea urchin was a highlight. I recommend the broiled tuna cheek meat too.","Monday: Closed

Gyozaoh!

The staff was incredibly welcoming and made us feel right at home. We tried a variety of gyozas, salads, chicken, and even some unique dishes like ostrich balls.

The menu had a wide range of Japanese dishes to choose from. One of the highlights was the Umeshu plum wine tastingwe got to sample all the different varieties they offered, and each one was excellent.

Overall, it was a fantastic dining experience, and I highly recommend it if youre in the area! A very popular among tourists restaurant serving traditional Japanese food and a rare find in Osaka! offering a variety of vegetarian and vegan options! The staff speaks good English, the service is quick, the prices are very reasonable and the food is tasty. My wife and I had heard great things about this place, so we decided to check it out. It's close to Dotonbori but still far enough away to not draw a huge crowd like other places. We waited about 30 minutes to get inside. The restaurant is small and there seems to be only one cook, which is why the service is a little slow. However, the wait is completely worth it. Their service is exceptional and this was some of the most delicious food that we ate during our stay in Japan.

We ordered the panfried gyozas, Japanese fried chicken, and another dish whose name I've forgotten. Everything was perfect. We also tried the brandy plum wine, which we loved so much that we decided to buy a bottle to take home. If you're in the area, make sure  that you eat at this restaurant. The wait for the delicious food will be worth it. Great food, very uncomplicated. They have gyoza, but also regional specialities such as skewers and classics like Karage chicken. We took a bit of everything and never regretted that decision. Service was kinda quick and the whole experience was very nice. We came here for dinner in the evening, be prepared to wait, we waited for an hour. The cucumber and fried tofu were good, nice and refreshing. We tried the vegetarian ramen and gyoza also the normal ramen and gyoza too. The food was great, lived up to its reputation. Would recommend coming here to eat.","Monday: Closed

KURA is located on the 40th floor of the Conrad Hotel. It serves grilled meat and sushi. My lunch menu was varied and very tasty. I was impressed by the choice of meat. The team was extremely courteous and friendly. The prices were fair. I can highly recommend a visit. Delicious teppanyaki with spectacular view! Conveniently located near metro. This teppanyaki uses a lot of fresh ingredient, but nothing special to offer special sauce,plating, etc. Id prefer something more creative at this price point almost 200 USD. Plus, there are manyyyyy good wagyu in Osaka. Prob wont come back again. An unforgettable dining experience at KURA  Teppanyaki  Sushi in Conrad Osaka! The ingredients were fresh, the presentation was exquisite, and every dish was perfectly prepared. The teppanyaki was a true highlight, cooked with precision right in front of us. The ambiance and city views made it even more special. Highly recommended for sushi and teppanyaki lovers! Best teppantaki in Osaka!
The food was so delicious, and very high quality. The cooking and show were a highlight! The chef shows incredible knife skills when he cut a Kuruma ebi. Our visit to Japan will forever hold a special place in our hearts, and one of the most unforgettable experiences was dining at this incredible restaurant. From the moment we stepped in, we were welcomed with the warmth, grace, and precision that symbolize Japanese culture. The food was not only delicious but presented with such care and artistry that it felt like an extension of the countrys deeprooted traditions. This was more than just a mealit was an experience that captured the beauty and honor Japan has to offer. A true lifetime memory for our family!","Monday: 11:30 AM – 2:00 PM, 5:30 – 8:30 PM

Normally a main chef is here cooking which is more entertaining yet chefs here collectively cook different dishes in same teppan. However its still a nice teppanyaki recommended. The food, service and ambiance were all great. The only setback is that the restaurant was a little small. There were only bar seats and two tables of four seaters. There were 5 of us and we had to squeeze in a table for four pax. Nevertheless, we still enjoy the food and services.  Excellent place. We loved it and even visited twice. Only meat is a bit expensive but i believe is what you expect fron a5 kobewagyu meat. Staff and menu English speaking, very friendly and cooking in front of you, so very clean place also. Many options besides meat and would come back again if we can. This place is amazing!  We loved the Wagyu beef and sides.

Highly recommended! The Village Osaka was wonderful! The chef and staff are so very friendly. They make a show out of the meal and are very attentive and really care about the food and the experience. Even the other customers were very friendly! We were greeted outside the restaurant by name when we arrived and had the best steak weve had in Japan so far. Highly highly recommended! Awesome experience with great food in Osaka.

Been here on Friday and they served buffet of biryani rice, mutton curry, chicken curry, salad, and lassi for only 1500 yen per person. The taste was good, coming around 11.30 and it was already full of people. We ate more than two plates as it was really tasty. Not only Muslims, many Japanese also come to have lunch here. I was skeptic before going because some of the reviews here says their behavior is not nice. Well there behavior is not up to the standards of Japanese waiters for sure but if you are from south east Asia youll find there behavior just okay. Thats how they behave in the local restaurants.

I tried their set A. According to me food cant taste any better with in the price they are offering. The nan was freshly baked. It was soft enough to take bites easily. The dal curry was best.

Highly recommended if you visit the area. I was visiting Osaka from out of town, and since theres a mosque nearby my Airbnb, I thought Id try some halal food with my boyfriend. We visited right at 5 and were the first customers for dinner. The reviews mentioning rude staff must be outdated, because the service we got from the two gentlemen were nothing but nice. They greeted us energetically upon our arrival and checked in on us throughout our meal. I know theres a few places around the area that serve the same cuisine for similar prices, but this one is IT! I seriously cant describe how good my meal was. Absolutely incredible. The best food Ive had in Japan. Ill be thinking about my meal for weeks to come! Second time I've been there. The staff is always very nice, the food is good and portions, depending on what you order, big.
Today we had a special meal! Maklube. So delicious, nice looking and a lot.
Try Maklube but don't forget to make a reservation ahead as it's not on the regular menu. Homefood hungerpangs led us to this restaurant, which we found through google.  The food was awesome, just the right spices. The service was even better. The server was kind and attentive. They also gave us complimentary sweets and chai lassi.

Live music on Friday Saturdays.  The fried tilapia with some kind of coconut milk sauce was crazy good . Take the stairs up to the second floor then the elevator up to the 4th floor from there. Great Filipino food at reasonable prices!  Owners are super friendly and helpful!  Food is traditional but not greasy as other places may be.  Had the adobo, whole fried chicken, fried rice, lechn kawali and bangus milkfish belly.  All super delicious! As a fellow Bisaya, the experience was great! Ate and kuya was really hospitable. The food was great. Which one would you pick? The Lechon Kawali? Chicharon Bulaklak or the fried rice. Omg! ofc, ALL!!!!!! Got my cravings covered! Try other filipino dishes here in Bamboo Restaurant that would probably satisfy your cravings. Had Dinner last night here at Bamboo and the service was incredible. The Owners made me feel right at home and chatted with us throughout the night. My friend and I ordered Lumpia Shanghai, Lechon Kawali, Chicken Adobo, Pancit Canton. All the food tasted amazing, my favourite was the Lechon Kawali. 1010 for the food and service.

The chef was friendly as well. I came without expectation because its a hotel restaurant. I was blown away at how good it was. My dinner was excellent. I had a set menu with the Wagyu A5 option. It was perfectly prepared and cooked by an awesome chef who even spoke some French. Visited during my visit last November when I was staying at W Osaka. Good food but not too standout, loved the service though. Also they will give you a pair of chopsticks as souvenir after the visit. A most beautiful experience that we had tonight! It's our first time in Japan and we wanted to try out the wagyuu beef at least once. Many restaurants were already fully booked, but this one, despite needing to book way in advance, welcomed us! We had to wait for 30 minutes but it was our bad so having to wait ONLY for 30 minutes was perfect! I would like to thank Ruka and the manager Nami who didn't hesitate to accomodate us.
The service was absolutely top notch, as Ruka, Nami and Kyohana were here to serve us with a lot of professionalism and good vibes. They never hesitated to assist us in any way possible and were always there may we require anything. They even do some conversations and smalltalk, which is greatly appreciated.
Of course, the diner wouldn't have been this beautiful without the chef Tsuminoe. Who introduced us to each meal and did his best despite the language barrier.

We ordered the Soup with bamboo shoot, absolutely delicious and not too heavy as to have space left. And then the Miyazaki and Wagyuu meat that they shared in two for my partner and I, so well cooked and seasoned. This experience of wagyuu was a wonderful first time for us.

The cost of the dinner was completely worth it, it's a must do if you want to have a good first experience of wagyuu.

Thank you again, Nami, Ruka, Kyohana and Tsuminoe for everything, you made our first time in Japan even more wonderful and you saved our evening, we will come back for sure! And this time with a reservation! My man Shoki had me and my wife in amazement by his culinary precision. For someone who looked quite young, he was skilled and experienced.
The Midou course was deliciousOishiii and offered a variety of different courses. We went on a weekday night around 6pm, and didn't need a booking! Our waiter was honestly very accommodating too and took a photo of us for the memories.

It was right by our hotel and after going on two nights and not finding a seat, we finally made it! It was so worth it. Get the fatty tuna sushi roll with green onions. You won't regret it. Awesome sushi at a reasonable price.  Ingredients make the food and the Wasabi, soysause and rice were special and complemented the excellent fish.
There are English menues. Service was excellent.
Lunch set was great and looking forward to dinner. Great atmosphere , amazing sushi , interactions with the staff chefs and other guests were unforgettable! Make sure to get a seat at the bar to see and interact with the chefs! Family run business! Fresh fish which you can taste! Best sushi in Osaka! Spoiler alert! We had the best time in Sushi Hayata!

I'm sad I didn't get the chef's name and everyone else. Their team consisted of four chefs at the sushi station, 3 gorgeous women at receiving.

We came in just slightly hungry because of all the vending mac drinks we consumed, so we decided to walk aro oir hotel neighborhood and along the way we pictured to eat some light meal with sushi to end our evening.

We tried to express to the chef and receptionist that we are entrust them to feed their recommendations. They could not get it at first, but in the end they seemed to enjoy feeding us.

We had sushi assortment, I'm not sure what they were exa but I will try my best to provide caption the sushi names what I remember.

My boyfriend ordered a nice sweet fruity plum wine with soda and I made a mistake of ordering a strong potato shochu on the rocks ""kurokirishima"" and they were all laughing at my reaction after taking a small sip. In the end my boyfriend and I exchanged. Aside from that, he ordered oolong tea and unexpectedly it was iced.

For the main events!!! The special sushi selections. I want to think they made it very special only for us.

We ordered chef recommended sushi assortment, and the others were just ""omakase""!!!  He told us which one to dip and not dip in the soy sauce. Mostly the ones he made separately from the sushi assortment don't need soy sauce dipping.

We both love sushi and we didn't know that fresh Japanese sushi should be tasting this good!!! Every bite and texture contributes to the flavor and whole experience.

We were recommended to eat white fish or the ones with ""lighter flavor"" first and the rest is fine to eat next, eat the fatty tuna and grilled mackerel last as they had ""heavier flavor"". We ate the tamago at the very last part.

TO SUMMARIZE EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD, PERFECT EXPERIENCE FOR US, BEST PLOT TWIST AND SURPRISE DINNER.

Squid ""ika"" sushi was a combination of crunchy and chewy texture that has bland but tasty flavor at the same time.

Sweet shrimp ""ama ebi"" sushi is so fresh and naturally sweet. An easy favorite!

All of tuna ""maguro"" sushi were excellent. It's our first time to try legitimate very fatty ""otoro"" sushi and my gosh they were melting in the mouth but without the ""oily"" feel of other fatty foods.

Grilled mackerel ""saba shioyaki"" was exceptional for my boyfriend and I found it the same too. Unlike other grilled fish sushi I've had before.

Sea urchin ""uni"" sushi is something I was unsure of because I'm not a big fan of sea urchin, which some friends and family are and I never understood why but after this one I'm converted! It has a mushy texture as expected but the flavor was very fresh, rich and creamy!

ALL OF THEM had balanced flavor, SUPER FRESH, no need for extra wasabi because it's already just perfectly incorporated in the sushi. The pickled ginger was also just right, strong but not overpowering and not chemicallike taste.

The setting is elegantly palatial, making you feel as if youre inside a European castle. The Michelinlevel feast was exquisite, with every dish meticulously prepared and delicious. As we left, the French head chef personally came out to thank us, bowing as he saw us off  a gesture that showed the utmost courtesy and attentiveness.

I would love to come back and try the other menus here if I get the chance.
Highly recommended. Nestled within The RitzCarlton, La Baie is a sanctuary of French gastronomy.  Experience unparalleled luxury with sophisticated ambiance featuring rich wood paneling, classic chandeliers, and elegant artwork.  Visually stunning plates and impeccable service create a truly exclusive and unforgettable dining experience. Celebrated birthday here went for the most expensive menu, good execution on all dishes, lobster outstanding. Wine pairing is good, but mostly white, we liked more red.
The whole dinner is about 130,000yen for 2 with wine pairing. Ordered the Elegant course with Wine paring tonight.
Food is delicious, and service is amazing.     Only fish dish is kind of too salty to me so will ask for light salt next time. The best fine dining in the Kansai area by far. La Baie, located in the Ritz Carlton is a great French restaurant with Japanese influences. The menu changes with the seasons and is always fantastic. I have been coming here with my wife for many years, and with fine Michelin star  experiences, the service is on another level. They know my food likes and dislikes, allergies, and know I am left handed. Most of this comes from observation rather than request. We will be back. Many more times.","Monday: Closed

Went bc we thought it might be funny, but it was pretty depressing. We were largely ignored, lots of additional charges, and a ton of period blood in the bathroom. It was also super empty in there. Left awkwardly cry laughing. Parfait was good though, just really expensive. Maid cafe was a fun experience, MOE MOE KAWAIIII. I am a baka gaijin, but the staff were very kind to us  recommended to come and experience Wouldnt go back again. Ordinary food but you pay more than any other restaurants. They charged you 880 yen for admission fee at the start and charge more for taking pictures with those maids. And you need to pay more for entertainment such as dancing.
Th place is just like an office in an old building. Its not what I expected when I go to a restaurant.
Wont recommend to any friends. Very cute maid cafe. It was the first Id been to, so I didnt know what to expect.
The cafe is located on the third floor and you have to take an elevator.
The menu is streamlined in that you scan a QR and the whole menu comes up.
I will note that you will not be having many conversations if you cant speak any Japanese, however, the experience was still very cute nonetheless.
Most people come to cafes like this for the novelty, so dont expect 4 food.
All the maids here are very cute Amazing experience with sweet ladies and good vibes. We may have had to use a translator a few times since we speak English but they were so sweet about it and helpful! The dessert is delicious overall and very cute! A little pricey but worth it for all the things that come in a set! We got the dessert set, which included one dessert, one drink, one picture, and the choice of a gift a folder or animal headband. Would love to come back one day!","Monday: 11:30 AM – 11:00 PM

Tonkatsu Daiki,"1-chōme-6-2 Higashishinsaibashi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0083, Japan",4.5,34.672592,135.50524,"It has a great reputation and it delivers! Really solid food, tasty homecooked style. The frying is soft and flavoursome, the cuts of pork are spot on. Its about as good as youd expect from a place like this. Does it exceed my expectations? No. But its definitely worth coming to. They do a fullhouse style service where the new group of clients all sit together and they dont let new people in until the place is cleared. This can mean an hour wait for every 1012 people in the queue. I waited for an hour and it was worth it. If theres a queue, each sitting takes about an hour to clear. There are tables that seat 4144 and counter seats that seat 4. But its great that they dont squeeze folks in. If there might be just a couple sitting in the table for 4. Be the first 10 in the queue when it opens saves the hour wait. We ordered a 250g loin set and an mos set with white fish and prawn and loin. I think the fish was the yummiest. So good we lined up twice!

Food was utterly delicious. Bib Gourmand 3 years running. On our first visit we had the pork fillet and the pork shoulder the fattier cut both were absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked, juicy, flavoursome, crisp outer layer and so tender. Meals are accompanied by rice, pickles and a cabbage salad with 2 sauces for dipping which were amazing for cutting through the rich meat. On our second visit we again had the pork fillet, but also wanted to try the curry which was delicious with a perfect amount of heat.

Service was also very good. Husband and wife team work seamlessly together. The chef making sure to visit each table and have small interactions which I observed the tables around me to enjoy. We were the last ones in the restaurant last night and both were happy to have a chat and talk to us about their business and life in Osaka. Very pleasant indeed.

We arrived on the first occasion right on 530 and had a short wait around 30 minutes, but arrived much later into service the second visit around 1920 so was waiting a little over an hour in the line. Again the owner came out to check on the line and update on waiting times regularly. 1000 worth the wait. This was my second time at Daiki and it was even better than the last. The commitment to quality is unparalleled. Yes, you will likely have to wait because the restaurant has few tables and the owner does not want to overcrowd or reduce quality. He was even honest and helpful to people who were in line about the length of time and directed them to other restaurants when they balked at the time. But once youre in, youll soon have one of the best meals in Osaka. The meat is perfectly prepared the breading is crisp and welltextured. The drinks are ice cold and available in stylish glass bottles.

Finally, I appreciate the personal touch the owner put in with every customer, coming and speaking with them between meal preps and offering advice and answering questions. What a pro! I will definitely be back. Although we had to wait a quite a long time to be seated, it was totally worth it. My boyfriend absolutely loved it and is still talking about it. We had tonkatsu many times on our trip my bf doesnt like seafood and this was easily the best we had.
There are two people working there, the chef also doubles as a server. He spoke in English which we were grateful for. Thanks again","Monday: 11:00 AM – 2:15 PM, 5:30 – 9:15 PM

Osaka Nadaman,"Japan, 〒530-0042 Osaka, Kita Ward, Tenmabashi, 1-chōme−8−５０ 帝国ホテル大阪",4.2,34.7009278,135.5194583,"Wonderful food and ever so flexible with customer's needs The night view was amazing.
The presentation was so beautiful that you could taste it with your eyes. Visited on the night of my stay.
Located on the 24th floor of the Imperial Hotel, the view was great. It was also the harvest moon of midautumn, so I was able to eat while watching the moon rising from Mt. Ikoma.

Although it was a course meal, there were several options to choose from.

The food was delicious, but it wasn't a particularly elaborate menu. My teenager was also eating with me, but I guess the taste was bland I can't help it since it's Japanese food, but I left some of the food behind.

Drinks were expensive since it was a hotel.
Beer is around 1,100 yen, and juices are around 800 yen.

I had made a reservation for 6 people, but even though I had not specified a private room, I was given a private room and charged a 5,000 yen private room fee. When I was paying, my mother grumbled, I thought you said you didn't need a private room.'' I wish I could have told you a few words when I entered the store.

Although it was a private room, the lights were in the wrong direction and my mother's seat was dark, so I pointed this out, but they didn't fix it. I think there were probably 4 people who were using the private room before, and the lighting was still adjusted for 4 people. Since I'm paying a lot of money, I wish they had adjusted the lighting in the room in advance. Throughout the meal, I kept saying that I was disappointed that the food looked so dark.

The payment was about 20,000 yen per person. I was looking forward to eating at a highend restaurant in Nadaman, but other restaurants in Kitashinchi have better service and more elaborate dishes. I don't think I will visit just for this store. We recommend eating outside the hotel even if you are staying overnight. First visit to Nadaman on the 24th floor of the Imperial Hotel in Osaka!
This is my second time with Nadaman 

The first time I went to Nadaman at Rihga Royal Hotel.
This time we went to the Imperial Hotel!

I went to lunch at my mom's request!

Lunch while looking at the view from the 24th floor is the best!
The window seat is definitely popular!
I went with a reservation for just a seat, but there happened to be an empty window seat.
I was given a tour! happy

For the first meal, you can choose between grilled fish or tempura.
For the second set, you can choose between beef or pork dishes.

This time we both ordered different things and shared them 

After all, Japanese food is the most delicious! I will reconfirm when I go to Tonadaman.
Too delicious...
The taste of this soup is indescribable, neither thin nor thick.
The sashimi is plump and the tempura is crispy.
There is nothing to complain about with all the dishes.

I want to eat Japanese food! If so, I definitely recommend Nadaman!
There are also multiple stores.

The restaurant in the hotel has great customer service! Something like that
It's amazing how thoughtful you were about what you were about to say.
A space where you can relax and enjoy your meal with hospitality.
I felt it was really nice.

I think I'll try it for dinner next time!
Thank you for the meal! It was so delicious! ! In December 2023, I ordered a 35,000 yen gift certificate course per person.
Everything was delicious, but the prices were high, including service charges and private room charges.
The sashimi was delicious.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 9:00 PM

The restaurant did not disappoint. We had the villa course and every dish that came out tasted amazing. The portion sizes were also perfect for us and we both left perfectly satisfied. I also proposed to my girlfriend and the restaurant even got us a nice cake and champagne for free after our meal was over. Both my fiance and I want to come back some day and eat the delicious food again! Indulging in breakfast at St. Regis Osaka's La Veduta is an experience worth savoring. From the moment you step into the opulent dining space, you're enveloped in an atmosphere of luxury and refinement. The Japanese set menu offers a tantalizing array of culinary delights, each dish meticulously prepared to perfection. Whether it's the delicate flavors of freshly made sushi or the comforting warmth of traditional miso soup, every bite is a journey through the rich tapestry of Japanese cuisine.During my stay at the hotel, I found myself drawn to La Veduta each morning, eager to start my day with a memorable dining experience. The attentive service and elegant ambiance only enhanced the enjoyment of the meal. As I lingered over breakfast, soaking in the serene surroundings, I couldn't help but appreciate the attention to detail that went into every aspect of the dining experience. It was a moment of tranquility amidst the bustling energy of Osaka, setting the tone for a day of exploration and discovery in this vibrant city. Good ambience though lights are a bit bright.  Amazing and attentive staff and good food Tall ceilings, spacious surrounds, professional servers. Went there with 8 adults and one child 1.5yrs. They placed us in a separate area but still connected. Food was served at the right quantity and frequency. Wine list that I saw was heavy on Bordeaux and Burgundy, some good Italian wines better value and a smaller selection of others.  For a group, the setting worked. Bonus was the 1.5 year old was very well behaved. They prepared a simple meal for him. We went there for breakfast and lunch. The breakfast was great. There are quite many dishes that can be chosen from, and there is also a a la carte menu. But something was burnt and the smells was strong in whole restaurant. The lunch was also good, but the we both think the entrees are better than main dishes. The tiramisu was so delicious.","Monday: 6:30 – 10:00 AM, 12:00 – 2:00 PM, 5:30 – 10:00 PM

Eventually we felt we should eat more so we proceed to order their Ala carte whole eel to enjoy again. Total cost spent for 2 whole eels was about SGD 130. Which is worth the experience.

Shop was easy to locate, just use your google map and can find it. 55! What an experience! The food was amazing and the workers were unbelievably friendly and sweet. You can choose between a table and chair or tatami. I recommend tatami for the full experience! After eating you go back downstairs to pay. Run by the 15th generation and opened in the 1700s, love the Kansai way of cooking unagi. Went there during off hours after 2pm, much quieter. Make sure not to wear perfumes, you may get refused to enter. We went there around 1130am on Tuesday and there was no wait at all. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor and seems like it is in a residential building rather than a commercial building. We have to remove our coat and place them in a plastic bag and carry it up with you but didnt really understand the logic even though they explained that is because the place was small. There are a total of 6 tables with 4 seats each. Food and service were good but prices are  on the high side. When we finished our lunch at around 1230 there wasnt any crowd at all which was not what i expected. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. We went around 1pm and was greeted by the most amazing ladies who paid full attention to us from the start despite their limited but just enough english. They had an English menu and we ordered with no problems.
The food was absolutely delicious and had no complaints. It was definitely a highlight for a visit to Osaka.
The room is very small but we are given tatmu mats to sit on but the option for chairs was available. There were 3 tables in the whole room so there wasn't much space. The price was a bit steep as expected of proper unagi but everything we experienced justified the price.
Overall, it was an amazing experience that I would do again. Please give it a try and meet the amazing ladies who gave the best service I've seen combined with unforgettable food.","Monday: Closed

He will make you feel like home while serving up your meal. It's a barrestaurant with limited seating, so, be prepared to wait a little. We order his delicious whole rotisserie chicken which was enough for 3 people. He does run out of chicken. But, the other items taste great, especially his roll with pic de gallo. He is from Per and knows how to cook. A super cosy and intimate atmosphere. The owner was very kind and accommodating to foreign customers. The food was delicious!! The chicken was so moist and all of the food was so fresh. There is only one person cooking the food, so if youre okay with hanging out and having a few drinks while waiting for the food, this is the place to be!

 Have english menu Tomato seafoods okonomiyaki was delicious. The cabbage are chopped finely. Big prawns n cuttlefish. Normal pork okonomiyaki was good and delicious too. Sauce and mayonnaise are perfect combination. Sausages are yummy. Omelette roll was soft and delicious. We even reordered it. Kimchi pork was delicious but not spicy and sour. Chicken yakitori are tender and juicy. Recommend. Food is great! We ordered cheese lotus, garlic rice, dashi egg rolls and two okonomiyaki. I personally love the garlic rice, though it sound like a simple dish but they are cooked to perfection. Kyoto locations offer much better Okonomiyaki and has other options.. I had to try Okonomiyaki while in Osaka, and this place was within 5 minutes walking distance from my hotel. I opted for a seafood okonomiyaki with soba noodle option, and I had them make one. Shrimps tasted very fresh with nice texture. I went there alone for a late lunch about 2 pm, and it wasnt clouded yet. I also had their specialty drink made with tomato juice golden tomato juice that is not red, and it hot the right spot for me!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Couldn't help but smile. The service was phenomenal the atmosphere was intimate. They cook right across the counter from. It felt like a dinner with friends. The food was amazing I had the tendon with prawns. Best meal I've had in osaka. Loved it. 5
stars hands down. Easily the best tempura Ive tasted in Japan. The ebi, fish, and yasai tempura were cooked to perfection, complemented by the sauce. They have an English menu, and the owners are very friendly. Will definitely comeback to try the dinner course. We knew we were in the right place when we stepped in and the entire counter was occupied by Japanese customers. There were three ladies in their kimonos! We had the tempura course. The batter was light and crispy. Each piece was nicely fried. One of the best tempura courses that we have had. We had a hint that we will be in for a treat when we were served curry powder salt as one of the condiments. True enough. We had the staple tempura pieces but some of the most memorable ones for me were the more unusual items. I have had tempura mochi or cheese before, and I plan to come back again soon to have these again. They were really good. I also liked their fried prawn wrapped in shiso leaf. The scent of the shiso gives a welcomed lift. We capped off our meal with the tencha, which was again a first for us. Really enjoyed the broth. It was a great way to cap the meal. Went in for dinner. They had a course menu but also had their lunch bowls. I think because it was a less busy week night.

Food was incredible, we had the lunch don bowls.
Staff was very attentive, if you are from the US this might seem overwhelming, but it's done kindly to be super helpful. Chef came over at the end of our meal to ask where we were from. Would recommend this place for a nice dinner.

Was a little hard to find. Go up stairs of the white building and it's the wooden door. Dinner was on the set menu with appetiser, salad, and desert included.

The excellent chef and friendly staff served us a variety of tempuras, ranging from seafood and vegetables to cheese and sweets. Everything was fresh and delicious and the chef choices were quite unique.

They did an excellent job teaching us the best spice or sauce to use with each tempura. I couldn't believe I can take such a massive amount of food without feeling bloated.

It was a random choice that turned out to be my best tempura experience.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 1:30 PM, 5:30 – 9:00 PM

We appreciated the amazing service, the staff speaks English and even made us an expedited lunch because we had only 1 hour to eat. The fish was of the freshest quality, and the chef was very skilled and talented. We will come back every time we come to Osaka, and I highly recommend for a memorable sushi experience. In a very surprising location, you find something very traditional. The chef was very dedicated and patient with us, informing us of every dish served. Every piece was exquisite and delicately shaped before our eyes. A great experience and set of flavors I highly recommend. My friends and I have never tried Omakase before so we decided to try this place after seeing its high reviews.

Its high reviews are welldeserved.

Food was great from the first bite to the last, and the chefs were kind enough try and explain the dishes to us in English, even pulling out their translator at times to field our curious questions.

The dishes served were really amazing, and we'd have loved to go for another round if we had the time and money.

Customer service was 1010, and the sake that was recommended to us was great too.

Only pity was that we didn't manage to get counter seats, but that's on us because we didn't manage to book early enough. Book earlier, guys!

TLDR mustgo dining experience in Osaka. Was surprised to find a restaurant that take a 1 person booking  as I had a lot of difficulty booking other places in.

Restaurant was easy for find if you take the escalator from the metro exit, takes you straight to 2F of the Festival Tower West.

The dinner started off with scallops sitting in a beautiful bowl of flowers. Every piece of fish was so fresh, I really enjoyed the omakase set ! I especially loved the uni, kohada, chuturo and the spanish mackerel. The egg omelette was cooked beautifully, not sure how they could achieve the spongy texture. The clear soup and dessert were a good ending to the dinner.

Top notch service by their friendly staff  everyone was so polite and smiley. Chef  couldnt speak a lot of English, but he still engaged with me. He also brought out a table with the english translations of the fish, which was a nice touch by the restaurant and himself.

Great dining experience! This was a fine sushifocused omakase, with a friendly chef.  He spoke a little English, is very skilled, and made great nigiri.  It was a good value and very tasty, but also not transcendental like the best sushi omakase experiences can be.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 3:00 PM, 5:00 – 10:00 PM

I was lucky enough to go to a store I had always wanted to go to!
It's about an 8minute walk from Shinsaibashi Station, on a street where there are many famous restaurants in Shinsaibashi, also known as Michelin Street.

It's crab season and it's super delicious!
Mmm, it was the best taste in the best space along with the sake! Momen is located on Michelin Street in Shinsaibashi!

I was able to go because of good luck.

The degree of perfection of each item is amazing

The dignified atmosphere unique to kaiseki restaurants is just right.

At the end, the rice, fish, and soup were stained.

It was a blissful time as I was given plenty of alcohol to drink.

I was wondering why it was difficult to make reservations at this restaurant, but I was satisfied.

This is one of the stores I would like to visit again and again if I have the chance.

It was a feast! It's delicious and I want to come back more, but it's difficult to make reservations.

The young sweetfish that were swimming in front of me just now
I received a delicious life.

Every piece of sushi was hand cut and perfectly made. Such a great, traditional way of making sushi that sets Sushi Daigo apart. This is a small traditional sushi spot run by the chef and his mother. If you'd like a true Japanese sushi experience, this is the place to go. The space is small with 10 seatings. Regulars will move in the middle of their meal to create space for you.  None of us spoke Japanese, but the chef was very friendly and tried everything to accommodate us.

The sushi was very good. Top quality fish with proper amount of rice. Very consistent portion of rice with air gaps which shows the years experience of the chef.

Keep in mind this place is cash only. I have been here twice and I would go a hundred more times if I could. This man is a sushi wizardthe inside of this place looks straight out of a Ghibli filmrandom boxes tucked away full of seaweed or random herbs. An oven that lost its door some time long ago, now replaced by a piece of tin foil. Pots with no handles brewing questionable looking pots of soup? Omakase runs around 5000 per person and I could not recommend it enough. Each piece of sushi was a masterpiece and it is a meal I will not soon forget. This place was beyond wonderful! The sushi was delicious, and prepared by a wonderful man who clearly was a master of his craft. The atmosphere was wonderful and we quickly bonded with the chef and the other patrons, with some of the best sushi we have ever had, at a very good price. There is no menu that we saw and very limited English, but a lot of delicious sushi and two drinks for two people came to less than 10,000 yen, and would absolutely come again! In love with this place!!!! This is a typical Japanese place where foreigners are ripped off completely and outrageously. There is basically no service staff, the owner does everything himself and serves a few sushi variations. For a few nigiris and sushi I paid over 7.000 yen as a single person, which is almost twice as much as at good restaurants in Tokyo, and they didn't even have the best tuna here.
If you're a bit clinically picky, you should also give the place a wide berth! Avoid it at all costs and look for a real restaurant to eat in!","Monday: 5:00 PM – 2:00 AM

I like the way they grilled the fish without steaming it beforehand.  The crispy skin was super yummy, even though the meat was thin compared to other eels restaurants.  The sauce made the rice very tasty, not too salty nor too sweet.  The roasted eel wrapped in rolled omelette was also delicious.
Highly recommended! The unagi lunch was delicious. The skin was bbq till slightly crispy.  Absolutely delightful......... Cost for a 4 and 5 pieces set around 7000 yen. This is my second time having Hitsumabushi eel. The first time i had Hitsumabushi eel was at Tokyo Sky Tree.

The taste is consistent across the stores. The eel was grilled perfectly, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. If youve never been, Id recommend ordering the set to try different parts of the eel  this is not something you can eat in every country.

Service was friendly and welcoming. Booking online was easy  its better to make a booking to avoid queue. We were in the area looking for a good unagi place and ended up here.

We got the crab liver tofu as an appetizer, the taste is pretty unique, I enjoyed it but my partner did not.

The eel box was quite good and we were enlightened about multiple ways to enjoy the eel on its own, with pickled veggies, and with ricebroth.

The food was a bit expensive for what it is in my opinion but otherwise enjoyable.

Friendly staff and nice clean interior. Unagi was crispy and savoury! Really delicious accompanied by the warm broth. I enjoyed the hitsumabushi way more than the unagi don. Price was slight expensive but understandable.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 2:30 PM, 5:00 – 8:30 PM

But once we arrived, the staff were very friendly greeting us. They tried really hard to figure out how to communicate with us, as they don't seem comfortable in English. Google translate helped and their service was top notch.

The food was incredibly creative. We had all sorts of fresh fish and vegetables in combinations that I have never seen before. They all tasted great. Some highlights were an amberjack ""sandwich"" with white radish as the buns, oyster rice in an iron pot, and their take on monaka for dessert.

We'll definitely come back next time we're in Osaka. Unforgettable Omakase experience. Chef is extremely kind and will explain all dishes in English for foreigners. Food is outstanding and extremely creative. Dishes are presented like if it were an art gallery. Definitely must come here if in Osaka. The atmosphere, staff, and food are at a level of the best restaurants in the world. Being American we decided to celebrate our Thanksgiving here and it was marvelous as the owner and staff made us feel like family.

The chef has delivered French style cooking methods to Japanese food with aplomb. Was an amazing experience that I would highly recommend. There was a person working there who spoke very good English to help explain dishes. My friend recommended this restaurant since it's her favorite and the one she revisits the most in Osaka. It's so good, and I highly recommend it to all food lovers. The chef and his son were very nice and tried to explain everything in English for foreigners It's my first visit! I was introduced to the store by a friend and was able to come to the store! I'm excited and looking forward to it
I did it. Start with chawanmushi, then appetizers!
They were all very particular about the ingredients, explained things well, and it was fun to listen to, and the food was delicious. The radish ring is also amazing! The shark fin, wagyu beef, crab rice, etc. were delicious and filled me upThank you.
Thank you for the meal 5 minutes walk from Kitashinchi Station on the JR Tozai Line. A wellknown creative restaurant that has been in business for over 50 years and has earned two Michelin stars.

Owner and chef Yoshifumi Mori, who will soon be 80 years old, is still in the kitchen, serving unique cuisine that is full of his worldview.

A variety of innovative dishes that are not Japanese, French, or Chinese. You can enjoy it with Baccarat and carefully selected tableware. I was able to enjoy original dishes made with seasonal ingredients. The skills of Asia's No. 1 chef are impressive. Visited the store for the first time. A chef from France will make it for you. The bread was also homemade, so the lunch was quite reasonable and good value.It was delicious.The winechampagne was also mainly French, which was great.

Honestly, the sushi is really disappointing. Nice presentation, but its tasteless, like they made it the day before and its been sitting in the fridge for a day. We tried the eel  butter, the beef and pepper, and more. We tried to find a good one but  Giving up on sushi, we switched to hot food but the Orange Chicken was covered in think, gummy dough and tasted like something from the supermarket heated up in the microwave. This decor is nice but I think this place is targeting tourists who just dont know any better.  Osaka has many great restaurants this is not one of them Entered the restaurant,thinking it was gonna be a nice fancy experience, the atmosphere is nice and music is jammy.

First thing I noticed when I entered was how expensive the food is. I thought wow the food much be great.

First i ordered a Bellini, i am not sure if they know what a Bellini is because what i received was not a Bellini.

Second i ordered 4 nigiri to start. Once i got the nigiri i noticed they did not give me a soy sauce plate. Its little things but for how expensive their menu is i would expect better service. The nigiri rice was cold and fish tasted not as fresh as one would expect in japan.

The worst part is I ordered their steak. But on the menu and what I received was different. On the menu there is 5 nicely cut steaks. I received 2 steaks pieces. this decisive marketing, its nicely presented but you should not deceive your customers.

When i asked the server for clarification, she went back and then started laughing with her colleagues.  Later when i was able to ask her what her manager has said she said the meat is cut thicker. I am also a cook, another lie. What i wanted was a sorry not an excuse.

This place is nice on the outside but cheap inside. I wish I could write a review focused solely on the amazing food, but unfortunately, the service at this restaurant was completely disrespectful. The sparkling wine we ordered was out of stock, and instead, they brought us a cheaper prosecco, charging us the same price. After two overpriced bottles, we were informed that they had run out of all sparkling wine. There was no effort to compromise, no discountnothing. It felt like we were not welcome there, especially after noticing their flaws such a shame. Ive passed by this restaurant many times over the past few years but didnt try it until now. I really should have gone way earlier because the food was superb!! The best sushi Ive had so far in Japan. The drinks too were very nice and the service and atmosphere were great too! I definitely recommend trying this place at least once! Next time we come were going to try the terrace seats so we can enjoy the night view too. Great stuff. I really appreciated the scenery and outside seating. The sushi was delicious and the service was fluid and efficient. It's definitely pricey though. The sushi was good, and the drinks weren't bad.","Monday: 5:00 – 11:00 PM

I can definitely see why it's on the Michelin guide. We enjoyed the presentation and quality of the food. We didn't love grilled dish, but would definitely try again if we were in the area! Just the best sushi we had in Japan. It was so well rated on tabelog and bib gourmand.
There were so many tastes and textures. Personal favourites were the squid and tuna, even the egg in dessert was so surprising, fluffy.
Right from the sashimi starters we loved this place.

The chef and the staff were so welcoming, talked very good English and took their time to explain each dish.

Thank you!

 Hands down to a great  value for money omakase place I havent experienced in a long time. Superb quality ingredients. Love how the chef is so happy and passionate at what he does. Staffs are also cheerful and providing great service. They can speak decent English, good enough to explain the dishes. Totally recommend. A Michelin Bib Gourmandselected restaurant that is out of the ordinary

1. The friendly clerks and owners comfortable smiles will satisfy your heart.
2. And the extreme costeffectiveness covers many shortcomings. Based on this premise,

let's look at a few disappointing points
a It's too hectic. Due to the store's concept, it receives several customers at the same time, so it is not the expected omakase atmosphere with customers leaving and entering, clerks, and people mixing together.
b. The quality of the sushi was worse than expected  the rice was a bit dry.

There are pros and cons, but I would like to check it out again the next time I visit Osaka. The place was already buzzing when we arrived with locals and tourists alike. Food was amazing for the price and service was tops!

Ok too many photos to load so just the menu this time..

Oh yes alittle hard to find initially.. it is on the 3rd floor if I remember correctly so keep a lookout for the building directory.

There were seats available during the time I visited. The prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is also good. It's within walking distance to Umeda Station, and I'd like to go there again if I have another chance. One of the best meals I have had in Oosaka,Japan. The price point was perfect for the quality of the food provided. Highly, highly recommend this place. If I am ever lucky to get a chance to visit Oosaka again, I shall definitely go there. We were a party of three and we ate everything on the menu literally. Amazing experience with amazing service that was authentic and delicious. Not many foreigners come here but they do have an English menu which is a big plus for me. We pretty much tired everything on the menu. The eel and cucumber was super delicious with amazing texture.  I usually don't like eel so I liked it way more then I expected. They do take reservations A hidden, cozy place. They don't speak English but they have an English menu. All dishes are small, reasonably priced and delicious. The local sake is nice, there is a separate menu for it. Everything is delicious but the sushi is what they are known for. Try to get there in the early evening. They seem to close around 12 a.m. but I came on a day when they closed at 2 a.m. so maybe it depends. I definitely recommend this place. In spite of the language barrier, it was one of our most enjoyable meals here in Japan. The chef and his assistant were patient with us. They have an English menu upon request. The seafood tastes fresh. Highly recommend the squid and octopus nigiri, and the negitori temaki. The sake was amazingly sweet and flavourful. And I really appreciate that this place is open late 6pm to 1am. Great if you are staying in one of the nearby hotels.","Monday: Closed

The staff were absolutely wonderful and took good care of us. Our favorite items were the charcoal dipped chicken skewers, broth and chicken rice. Great yakitori omakase experience focused on fire grilled chicken and its many parts!. I was the only foreigner when I came and it was an amazing experience to be there with all Japanese guests, I really got to feel the love of food all the other people in the restaurant had! Every course was delicious and nicely grilled over the fire, which we could see from our counter seats. Some cuts were not as cooked as I am used to, but my North American palette is to blame for that! The chicken thigh with scallion, the chicken liver, the cheese in broth, the chicken burger sandwich and the chicken meatball were my favourite courses. The chicken prosciutto was super interesting as well. You can also order extras of your favourite skewers at the end before dessert if you wish. The chef also made sure I was okay and took the time to explain to me what each course was in English, which was much appreciated as there was no written menu. We had a great night here. Food was amazing and staffs were friendly and active. Dining here is full of joy and laughs. The chef came to every seat to deliver or explain dishes. Very relaxing atmosphere and we will come back again. Words really don't do justice to this place, nor pics. The fowl maestro plays well with fire here, and his good team helps keep the flow smooth. For chicken lovers, you definitely MUST come! 2 seatings  4pm or 6.30pm. There is a small 4 seater private corner away from grill, but otherwise, you will be seated at the open kitchen to see the master and his team at work. No issues at all with heat or smell from the grill after the meal.

Funnily, the toilet of all places carries a spectacular pic of the maestro at work.

The highlight meal of our NakaSendo trip. APRIL 2023

Dined here a week after Yakitori Matsuri and I enjoyed the omakase course just as much the quality of the chicken and the execution of the grilling was on point, very delicious. Most of the chicken skewers are the same as the sibling restaurant but with some variations in the other dishes so if you eat at both restaurants you get to try something different. Twothirds into the course they offered a menu where you can order additional skewers including rare parts of a chicken. Decided to give the ovary a try which I don't think you will find outside of Japan, and it tasted just like egg yolk, very creamy. The chef and staffs were friendly and the service was great they check with the diners if they are ok with certain dishesany dietary requirements.","Monday: Closed

This is my second time at this restaurant, and it's not just about steak.
This is a restaurant where you can enjoy all kinds of teppanyaki dishes such as abalone and shrimp in course meals.

It has a nice atmosphere and a spacious structure, so I think it's a good place to entertain or entertain your loved ones.

We have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages, including champagne and wine, and while you enjoy delicious food, you can enjoy the drinks and have lively conversations, so you can enjoy the fun atmosphere and feel happy.

I didn't tell the staff anything, but through a casual conversation, I learned that my daughter had been accepted into university, and she decorated the final dessert plate.
The production was wonderful, and my daughter was very happy with it, making me glad that I chose this store.

They were able to accommodate food allergies and provide a separate menu.

If you want to entertain important customers and make them happy, I think this restaurant is well worth using.

Thank you for the meal. Not only was the food delicious, but the restaurant's atmosphere and lively conversationfilled presentation made all participants feel happy.

The store is very clean and the interior is nice.
However, the restroom was clean so it was good, but it was unusually dark and other customers were surprised.
For the meal, I selected and reserved the specialty lunch course.
I'm sorry for the service, but I thought it was the worst for the store.
First of all, why is there no menu for course meals?
Even if you are asked to choose your pasta at the beginning, there is no explanation of what kind of dishes will be served later, so it is difficult to choose because you cannot see the balance of the entire course.
For the main meat dish, which is better pork or roasted beef? Even though I was told this, there was no explanation about what kind of part it was or the taste of the sauce, so I was left wondering...
I chose beef, but it was so raw that it looked like it was only seared on the surface, so I thought I should have chosen pork instead.
If it's that rare, I think it's a good idea not to ask about the doneness.
Furthermore, the beef was a bit smelly.
The squid oil pasta and sauces were delicious.
So other dishes may be delicious.
I wish Dolce had incorporated even a small amount of seasonal fruit.
The appetizers had a rather strong flavor, and I wish they would serve the bread at the same time even if the order was different.
I don't like it when the service lady comes to clear the dishes right after I finish a plate.
I also thought it was strange that even though he was idle and not busy, he didn't have a smile on his face and was unfriendly.
It's a nice shop, but it was very disappointing. I went there for lunch with my boss at work.
It was raining, so we ate inside the restaurant, but if it was sunny, we would have eaten on the terrace along the river. You can also eat there.
You can see Nakanoshima Public Hall across the river.

It was quite busy at noon.
The lunch course was plentiful, and they also asked if we would like to have a lunch break and what time we would like to leave the restaurant.
There were two types of pasta and meat to choose from.
The food was very delicious, but we also had a variety of desserts, which were both very pleasing to the eye and delicious. I made a reservation at 6pm and received a simple course.
I left out one dish of pasta.
It was a decent volume.
The taste is good and the view is even better! The view is nice and the food is delicious, but the portions may not be enough for men. Unfortunately the volume.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 5:00 PM, 5:30 – 11:00 PM

LiLo Coffee Roasters,"Japan, 〒542-0086 Osaka, Chuo Ward, Nishishinsaibashi, 1-chōme−10−２８, Shinsaibashi M, １階",4.8,34.6740723,135.4980336,"I found myself returning to this charming coffee shop 4 times within just 3 days, both during the day and at night. I had a variety of their offerings, including iced drip coffee, hot drip coffee, iced latte, and hot latte, and each one surpassed my expectations.

I asked for the barista's recommendation, and she took the time to learn my preferences, providing great suggestions with patience. Despite the bustling daytime crowds, the staff managed to provide exceptional service even though there were a lot of customers. Personally, I found the evenings to be the ideal time to visit with fewer customers, I could savor the coffee and the ambiance at a leisurely pace.

Additionally, I purchased some beans and drip bags from the shop to experience their flavors at home. In summary, my experience was nothing short of perfect  a solid 1010 rating.  Cute tiny spot offering a large variety of coffees to choose from. Great tasting coffees, probably the best weve had so far here in Osaka. Service is really good and every order comes with a small booklet about the coffee house and its founder.

The only unfortunate side effect of their popularity is that it can get really crowded at times, as you can see in my pictures. Come at the wrong time and youll be in line behind maybe 56 people waiting to order as well. Not a big deal, youll just have to wait maybe 1015 minutes for your coffee, and sitting situation might be a bit of an issue, especially in the heat of the summer, but not too big of a deal breaker. Funny enough, at other times, the shop will be empty with only one or two people enjoying their coffee.

Regardless, great place to go to for coffee.

Oh and a small side note I do feel that they give you the most coffee out of the other spots Ive been to so far. Most other places only gives you this small cup of coffee while at Lilos youll get a decent sized coffee. Friendly service, great coffee. I had the pour over of Uganda light roast and Nicaragua medium roast and both were so smooth!

They take cash only when I visited so be prepared!

There is almost always a line but it moves fast. Be sure to check the menu while you wait in line!

A highlight of my short visit to Osaka. Definitely worth it! Great coffee roaster! They have a menu of coffee beans from many countries featuring different flavour and profile. A tad pricey but okay to pay for the quality. Limited sitting space but great for take out. Very friendly staff! Efficient! I happened to smell the aroma of coffee while walking in Osaka at night, so I bought light roasted coffee beans is China  Brazil. After returning to Taiwan, I brewed a cup myself. Its really delicious and fragrant

I will buy coffee beans and enjoy coffee again next time

I must say that the waiters are really classy, friendly and considerate","Monday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM

We had some grilled cheese ham sandwiches, an affogato, black sesame drink and a surprising good salted caramel porter. Everything was very tasty! Highly recommended for a visit! Awesome little pocket with toasties, coffee and some beer and cider if youre here at that time of day. Great breakfast place to start the day. Friendly service, very cool atmosphere and decorations. Can also leave your name in chalk on the walls. Sign out the front makes it easy to find. Definitely worth a visit Great place to stop by! It was a bit packed when I went, but luckily I was able to sit at the counter. Drinks are so good! I really like the espresso martini. They mainly serve sandwiches and desserts . I love their PB nutella cookies! Too bad i ate it all before taking pictures. Great coffee and cookies. I've tasted an oat milk hot latte and it was really good. It's smooth and intense at the same time. Matcha cookie is amazing I visited the cafe in the evening. The place is quite tiny. The pudding was just perfect! The peanut butter cookie was great. The staff is very nice and  helpful.

I recommend this place if you come with friends , want to socialize and play board games there are bunches of games available on shelf.
As a tourist, I don't think this place suits kids, elders or a people who travel alone.","Monday: 1:00 – 11:00 PM

The entrance to the cafe is on the right side of the building. Theres an elevator you have to take up to the floor the cafe is on.
My friend and I got there at around 1120 on a Thursday and we were the only ones in there at first. Its a beautiful cafe. Love the artwork on the walls, which I think they might swap out from time to time.

We each ordered a lunch item, a dessert item, and a latte. Everything we got was good. Our total came out to about 134 for everything, or 67 each. This isnt a cafe I can go to all of the time so it was a great splurge spot. I would go back again for sure.

The staff were wonderful too. They were all so nice and just attentive enough. Le Caf V in Osaka, Japan, is Louis Vuittons first caf in the world!  Situated on the 7F of LVs flagship store in Shinsaibashi, the restaurant is as chic and artistic as the iconic white building.  Guests who do not need to shop can reach the caf via the elevator hidden in the side alley.  Outdoor seats are available.  The spacious and bright main dining room has a very high ceiling.  Servers are polite and professional.  However, food quality is a bit inconsistent!  Drinks and desserts are the most delicious and pleasing to the eye.  While the medium rare Sandwich Filet de Boeuf Wagyu GyuKatsu JPY 5,000 looks more rare than medium rare and tastes a bit dry, the medium order of the same dish looks more medium rare than medium and is noticeably juicier.  It feels like tea time would be the best time to visit this IGworthy caf. We stoped by after seeing good reviews and there was a big queue. I got a affogato rum raisin and my friends got a coffee which can be personalised in how they make it and cheese cakes. The affogato was very good and the expresso was high quality, but the cheese cake was way too small for the price considering I have had better for way less. The place was a bit small but the overall look of the place was nice. Swanky and beautifully designed to allow plenty of outside light. This is a perfect spot of an afternoon tea with a side of sweets. During my visit the place was quiet and smaller than I expected, but felt very intimate. The menu is very limited on true meal items, however diverse enough to satisfy all taste buds. Wagyu sandos sell fast so make sure to go early if this is on your list.  To enter, you will need to go through the side of the store not the main entrance. There will be an elevator that will take you to the top floor. Upon your exit, feel free to spot by the exhibit in between floors to the grounds. Nice experience, I would return for tea time. LV la viva. Visit here for Louis Vuitton's V drink and popular desserts. Get yourself a moment of tranquility away from the busy shopping streets and purchase queues of Osaka Namba.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

The Osaka outlet has a way more welcoming vibe than the Akiba outlet which I did not have a good experience at. The staff here had great energy and was always hyping up the place, even when serving food and  even complimented my mini WoLs!  A must visit for ffxiv fan!

I have great experience visiting this Uldah theme cafe.... The giant scions poster are great for a pic with them. The food was fine.

The staff are very friendly, lively and helpful.

Our table also won the Jumbo Cactpot and got this giant honey toast. Lucky!  The Eorzea Cafe is a must for any FFXIV fan. I've been here twice now and each time the staff has been so nice. The drinks are absolutely delicious and the food is great to. I highly recommend this as a stop for any FFXIV fan while in Tokyo or Osaka. I had a amazing time with friends in both the Osaka location and Tokyo location, service was great and they have given me a free placemat for the new Arcadion raid when I made a mistake with the lamination. 1010 would visit again whenever in Japan. The drinks were fun and tasty If you enjoy or ever played the FFXIV game, you will enjoy your time at the Eorzea Cafe! The food was delicious, the atmosphere was fun and the staff was so very kind and helpful! There's even a lottery depending on your seat number and you can win some prizes.

They offer you the experience of preparing your own matcha in the traditional way, using a ceramic cup of your own choosing. The latte is foamy and you can add sugar to your own taste for me, much better without any. The service is excellent, they explain about the different kinds of tea leaves and they even have a little shop where you can buy ceramics, matcha powder and green tea powder. This was a placed I had saved as a place to visit. I was glad to have found it.  Kaoru... whom greeted us with the most warm welcoming took care of us. As it is our first time she was more than happy to make suggestions and answer any questions. I loved her customer service was above and beyond. We learned about her green tea and its origins  I had the green tea ice cream and latte were just amazing after a nice light snack. I believe we made a new friend we will b back as much as we can for the delicious desserts cant wait to try more recommendations. Drinks did not make the picture drinks were too good. Adorable green tea shop so good I came back twice on my trip!

Lovely menu with a great variey unsweetened as standard to really get the matchagreen teahoujicha flavours. The freeze dried adzuki beans were a lovely accompaniment!

And being able to pick your own cup was such a lovely way to browse Japanese ceramics! Went during a weekday and immediately given a seat. Sell all things matcha and even the bowls and tea powder. Had just the matcha 900yen and they served with dried red beans which was heavenly! First time having that and the natural sweetness of it! Must go if you are a matcha fan, away from kyoto. Great tea rest stop for travellers alike with free refills, loving the matcha tea variety available in stores. We made some tea purchased from this store and the quality is premium.

Do step foot in and order yourself a lovely kettle of green tea ","Monday: 1:00 – 6:00 PM

We had both salty and sweet toasts, they were excellent.

1 for the Englishfriendly
1 for the milk alternatives cow, almond, oat

Totally recommend the place for a breakfast. Their black coffee boasted a rich, fullbodied flavor with subtle hints of chocolate and a pleasant, lingering aftertaste. The aroma alone was enough to awaken my senses and set the tone for a delightful experience. Paired with the coffee, the cheesecake was light and fluffy, with a creamy texture that melted in my mouth. The sweetness was perfectly balanced, ensuring that each bite was a harmonious blend of flavors This is the best cafe I have been to in a long time. Though the interior is pretty small, the atmosphere and decor is really nice and calming. The customer service was excellent and the foodcoffee was amazing. The workers also speak English so it is definitely tourist friendly. The latte art was also really stellar. It was love at first for me! Enjoyed morning coffees here. We tried the organic blend in both iced latte and hot americano and were great. We waited a little while despite there being a couple the only ones who ordered before us so wouldnt recommend it youre in a rush. Staff are so friendly and upbeat, great relaxed atmosphere! Came here for breakfast. Firstly I like they open at 8am which is earlier than other cafes around and easier for tourists who want to start the day early
Coffee was good but toast was even better
Really recommended the French toast
Also I got the window seat which was fantastic and you can see the cars and people walking by

Speciality coffee, cold brew, seasonal positions, classic cappuccino and latte and more. Menu available in English. Friendly barista made one of the best coffee for us to go. Best roasted green coffee in Osaka and wonderful atmosphere as well  I'm really picky about coffee but this shop surprisingly met my standards. It's on a little side street, not far from some museums.

The owner is strict about quality control so he runs it himself. I recommend bringing your own food as it's allowed.

If you order cold brew, it comes out quickly but other coffee will take time as he carefully makes it by hand drip style.

The mango Calpis espresso cocktail looked good but I wanted to drink pure coffee. The cold brew was really deep and had strong bold intense flavor. The iced Kenyan was like dried apricots, acidic and fruity.

The size of the coffee here is really generous. Much, much better than any chain coffee shop. Try it out. Bring your own food, for an even better experience. With many coffee options within this business district, we came across this small, quaint and cozy shop that offers quality if not the best coffee Ive had in a very long time! The owner and operator will seat you and create a perfect cup of  pour over. The owner speaks English which was nice to converse with. Spend your money at a small business like this and trust me it will be worth every penny. Affordable pricing! Small coffee shop but with good music and good coffee!

The shop are surrounded by nice coffee fragrance. Highly recommended especially for coffee lover! Thanks!","Monday: Closed

The food ,we ordered the tuna sandwich and the egg sandwich they both were very delicious and have unique taste.

The place was pretty quiet and calming when we went! I highly recommend it The cafe offers decent view of the river and quiet space. The staffs were friendly and genuine.

The building is very narrow but has 3 floors.
Basement 1 Has no window view

2nd floor, 3rd floor small room of window view Just love this cafe. I did try iced latte and tuna sandwich. All is good and perfect. Staffs are very friendly and helpful.

It is located just right at the corner of the bridge with a beautiful view over the river. Long waitingQueueing just because of the river view. But we have no luck for the outdoor seating Excellent food and view was amazing. Tuna sandwich was really delicious. Also love their coffee and desert was really nice.

Only problem was the waiting time. We wanted to sit in the terrace and there was a table empty but for some reason we still has to wait and the other 2 tables people were just sitting and chatting after they finished their meal which i think didny make sense to let people wait while others are done with their food and just chatting.

I recommend to put a time for each table once their done they can let others get inside.

I had a very good memory from it and came again after so long to see how it was. It remains as an excellent choice for having a nice coffee next to the river, even better if its during a nice autumn morning. There are more customers than before, but still it wasnt hard to find a place to sit down in the terrace outside. Went here because of a recommendation from a content creator. Almost couldnt get to enjoy the view since we were lost.

This place is definitely a must go to enjoy tranquility in the heart of Osaka. Their coffee are also so smooth and foamy. I ordered latte and the coffee is enjoyable during the dawn.

The staff are so friendly and helpful. The barista is skilled. Save this place and visit later This location is special with an incredible atmosphere. They have a huge variety of coffee for sale but unfortunately only serve one kind of drip coffee per day, I which we could pick the beans. We had a bagel that was so so, the bread wasnt very good but the cream cheese and salmon were generous and tasty. The variety of drip bags for sale was also great, will do for great souvenirs. One of my favourite coffee shops in Osaka. This place at kitahama has a great view of the river if you sit outside at the patio area
Coffee is great and one of the best in Japan that Ive had this trip
Very good for sit and relax on an afternoon esp when its not too hot
Great atmosphere and coffee overall This coffee shop is located by the river. There are indoor and outdoor areas. The atmosphere is very good. It is suitable for sipping the shop's delicious coffee. I like it here.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM

The eggs Benedict was delicious, though I personally would have preferred the egg to be cooked just a little longerabout 30 secondsso that the egg whites weren't quite as runny. But thats just my taste.

The pancakes were I think kinda classic American style and absolutely delightful. They had a great balanceneither too sweet nor overpoweringly coconutty.

I had read some comments suggesting the coffee here wasnt great, but I disagree. While it wasnt extraordinary, it was perfectly finenothing exceptional, but certainly not bad. For true coffee connoisseurs, perhaps consider trying the lemonade instead. 

Overall, it's definitely worth a visit!  I was going to go to A Happy Pancake, but after a redditor commented on my itinerary that Micasadeco  Cafe is better, I decided to go there instead. And I was very glad that I did because the pancake was so good! It was the best and fluffiest pancake I ever had. I would definitely go again. I got there around 11AM, there was no wait, but after I sat down, the place got full and the people after us had to wait. The location I went to was tiny so if you go at 12PM you may need to wait. The pancakes are made fresh after it is order so it takes about 20 minutes for it to be ready. After 20 minutes, I got my pancake, and it was definitely worth the wait! 1010. Very Disappointing today of what they have served for the supposed to be yummy fluffy pancakes.  I went there six years ago and the fluffy pancakes are light and  yummy.  However, today I went again and found that the pancakes are heavy, tasteless, textures are harddry and honestly for about 2000 per serve which is not quite make sense and justify for the pancakes.  Drip coffee is super weak and matcha latte was ok.   I wouldnt recommend it personally apart from taking photos.   If you are foodies and love foods more than taking photos, this will not be justified.  2 people 2 serve of pancakes and four coffee costs 5980 which I could have done better quality meal  in somewhere else.  Few minutes walk from  JR Namba Station.  The cut off time for the fluffy pancake order is 11am.  No queue as we arrived on Sat around 1045am.  But people start queuing up around midday.  All the customers there are tourists while I was at the cafe. Fluffy ricotta cheese pancakes were good, soft, flavorful  presented well. The spicy vegan curry was nice not much kick to it but well executed plate with brown rice cooked properly with a small refreshing side salad. The atmosphere well the food makes up for the lack of. Nice job overall guys We came here on a weekday around 12 noon for brunch and there was no queue. The airconditioning was perfect for the summer heat.

The menu however was rather limited and you needed to have 3 thick fluffy pancakes with no other options with lesser pancakes priced at 1,750 yen. It was slightly overpriced in my opinion as weve had better and more affordable ones.

They have a seasonal menu which could be fun.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM

Its been the best mocha Ive had since coming to Japan. Perfectly balanced mocha as the drink was not too sweet and coffee was very strong. The barista even asked girlfriend and I to choose whether we wanted a medium or dark roast. Mochachocolate flavor did not overwhelm the drink at all.

The male barista that helped us spoke very good English. Cute little nook of a coffee shop. Most of the cafes in Shinsaibashi open at 9am onwards. If you are looking for a cafe that opens early, this is the place to go. Coffee is good. Staff is very friendly. The cafe atmosphere is also nice. Good place to start your day.

Coffee latte is great! Highly recommended.

Cakes are good but the banana cake was a bit too hard expect to be a lot softer, cheese cake and strawberry moose cake are delicious. Kitchen is the selling point of this cafe, both the salad props to the kawaii toasts and the montblanc were quite good. I had the egg sandwich and it was amazing! I highly recommend it!

Food was above average and the whole cafe was decorated extremely well, prices were more on the expensive side but thats to be expected. This place is very cute but honestly overrated and over priced. There is no options for vegetarians or vegans and the kitchen is unable to make adjustments to any dishes on the menu, something to bear in mind if you have dietary requirements. The food presentation is 1010 but the taste is just fine. The pikachu show is cute but goes for so long, you can't leave your seat at all during this time. Also you can get in without a reservation, there's a queue for cancellations we waited about 30 mins and were able to get in.  Great experience, food is okay. Nothing like this in Australia. Booking online tip. Yes all bookings are gone in the first 10 secs. Wait an additional 1520 min, timeouts will start to occur, and sessions will open up. Keep refreshing between the 1520 min window.you need to be quick. I bought into the hype and went here for late lunch.   I did not think the experience was worth it.   Food was rubbish, drinks rubbish and service rubbish.  Also I found the staff a bit rude.  They wouldnt even take a group photo of us.  Is that not super rude?   I contrast this with Kinopias cafe Nintendo land in Universal Studios where the themed food was tasty and the staff were so nice they offered to take group photos of us. We saw that there were some seats available so we tried a walk in without any reservation. Got our table in just a minute! Amazing given how folks who come here tend to book way in advance. The food is okay. You are paying for the decor and experience. Gengar drink was too sweet but the ice koohii was smokey enough. There is also a  mascot meet and greet towards the end of the dining experience with some interaction. The mascot who came out was the chef Pikachu! Very cute. There are also some merchandise that you can get only if you dine in. Great experience if you are a pokemon fan! ","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Tables Cafe,"Japan, 〒542-0085 Osaka, Chuo Ward, Shinsaibashisuji, 2-chōme−5−１５ 1F",4.1,34.66973770000001,135.5007713,"Delicious and fluffy pancakes, there is custard inside the whipped cream. The cream was thick and fragrant. I was pleasantly surprised to see vanilla beans in the custard too. The strawberry jam paired nicely with the pancakes.

Beef hamburg steak was tender and juicy. I did not expect it to come with rice, but its good to eat it with the hamburg.

Beautiful interior. Popular with local ladies and hotel guests. There were chairs beside us to place bags, but they were occupied by current guests, so not every guest has an area to place their belongings. 1010 a great place to stop for a coffeetea and sweet treat. Food options are a bit limited, but their sweets and coffee are great. Service is great too, friendly, welcoming and quick on refilling water. A very relaxed atmosphere and lots of space for a crowded area in Osaka. Many tables. If you need a sweet pick me up I'd recommend it. They also have alcoholic beverages if you want to have a sweet brunch. This place more suitable for dessert and drinks rather than full dinner. They only offer 5 different set rice menu.
Overall it's a good food. The price it's affordable price. The atmosphere comfy and nice for meeting or chilling. Opted for one of the recommended dishes, i believe it's their seasonal item. Love the variety and taste! Ambience is perfect too. Looking for a breakfast place for lunch. Food was delicious and the coffee was strong and good. We got the pancakes with egg and bacon  and the chicken over rice. I got the coffee float which was amazing!!! Highly recommend. Last note, the pancakes have cream cheese in the middle!!!!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Kuma Kafe,"4-chōme-4-15 Chikkō, Minato Ward, Osaka, 552-0021, Japan",4.8,34.6555406,135.4315394,"MENU CHANGEDNo more gluten free options and breakfast is not being served anymore. Initially came for both of the aforementioned but ADAPTABILITY is key in life.

So we opted for the Shepherds Pie, Vegetable sandwich and a cheese pizza. Really nice portions are served and the taste of the Shepherds Pie was absolutely extraordinary.

The Veggie sandwich was art. So, beautiful with an array of bright colored layers. The 'ORANGE' pumpkin  was most prominent star, as it is currently Pumpkin season.

The pizza unfortunately   was not good dry, no taste, and tasted similar to a matza cracker. The sauce and cheese though were really good but the crust tasted plain and gluten freebut it wasnt??!  Reheated in the air fryer home and it was really good.

The mango juice and citrus tea were refreshing.

The service was good. The Bears were cute. There was a que at the door, and upon entering we were advised there would be a 30min wait for food but it was much shorter.  Our server spoke excellent English. Such a hidden cute cafe!
Love the crazy bear decor, and the staff are diabetes level friendly!
The food may seem a wee pricey, but soo worth it! You get a HUGE portion! Go with your belly empty and leave with both your heart and tummy full  The waitress was super nice to us, the portion was unbelievably big, and the food was delicious.
The burger patty itself wasn't that great to be honest, but the additions bacon and egg were incredible and compensated for the patty.
The place is really nice and comfy.
I also took a cold americano with soy milk which was nice. The aesthetic are unbearable, in the best way. It gives a nice cozy atmosphere and vibes. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They even made sure we didnt have any food allergies after taking our order. We got the Hawaii burger and Kuma burger and to drink the grapefruit ade and the Italian soda litchi. The buns were fresh and delicious, the kuma burger had a little to much sauce. But it still tasted great! The drinks were refreshing and hit the spot. Best place Ive eaten in Japan thus far. Staff is so friendly, food is DELICIOUS, great portions for the price  everything sooo cute!","Monday: Closed

The food was good, the real star of the show was the drinks especially good ""Old fashioned""!. Omedetou Cowboy Bebop! Had an absolutely lovely time here with my wife back in October during the Persona 5 theme cafe. Great desserts, sweet drinks, wonderful memories. Would recommend it if the current theme is a favorite of yours! Unfortunately all seats were reserved the day we came. So we weren't allowed to enter. Apparently this happens frequently. CafRestaurant with Anime Themes. In my case it was Cowboy Bebop. Unfortunately the Staff does not speak English, the translation of the menu wasn't very helpful.

First of all the people that work there are quite nice but the show is really when the bear paw comes out. My daughter was quite delighted when the paw not only gave her the drink it also wanted to play a game and Hifive such a sweet concept. my matcha was slightly weak and milky but i still enjoyed it nonetheless! there is an air conditioned seating area around the back, decked out with so many bear decorations!! love this place so much thankyou mr bear !!!! What a lovely concept this place is! We came just after 11 and got served straight away. Everything was well explained and our matcha latte was great.

The bear at the little window interacts with you for a few seconds and it's all really adorable and a feel good place!

There's also seating available. Highly recommend for a little heartwarming start to the morning at a reasonable price. I'm usually very picky when it comes to cafes and eateries. But oh my goodness, when I say there's cafe is the best cafe in Osaka, I mean it! The matcha parfait was beautiful. Quite sweet but the matcha flavour came through so strongly. The atmosphere was very cute and comforting. It really makes you feel like you found a little nook in the middle of a fairy tale story. It's very unique with the bear hand service and it really adds a cute experience when receiving your order. Don't forget to check out the seating area around the corner where you can buy a souvenirs and little goodies. Would highly recommend this as a mustsee on your Osaka itinerary. I will definitely be coming back for sure!! Came on 2 Dec 2023 with my hubby and 2 boys 16 and 8 yrs old.  We were lucky that after ordering 4 drinks and 2 cookies, we could sit inside to rest and write a note.  It was a wonderful experience, especially for my little boy who had been very tired after so many days of travelling and not being able to get the thing he wanted from this trip.  The bear paw hand shake makes him forget all the pain.  The drinks and cookies are very good.","Monday: Closed

The customer service is amazing and so is the food. I always get the veggie burrito  my brother likes the chicken burrito as well as the tuna melt. We love it every time. It's always fresh and filling. They also have amazing drinks. I haven't been to a more friendly and professional place during this visit, yet. They also have dinein options. They close at 1800hrs and start cleaning around 1730hrs so, if you want food, I'd suggest you get there by 1700hrs to give them time. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. It's well worth the visit with portions worth the yen. Great customer service and a great menu. The vibes and set up in this cafe are wonderful Theres a large communal table, it was great to chat with so many new faces from all over the world . We drink coffee everyday, two to three cups sometimes. And we have one of the best cappuccinos we have ever had here. Their classic was a blend of Colombian, Brazilian, and Ethiopean beans, dark roasted but had flower aroma and fruity taste. Surprisingly without a tinge of bitterness. Generous portions too. Enough for two to share at just a small cost. A coffee place that feels like home in Melbourne! Aussie cafe vibes are definitely shining through here. Great coffee for 500600yen. The creme brulee syrup was a nice sweet addition. Ham and cheese toasties with pickled mustard hit the spot before a few hours at Osaka Aquarium. Card payment readily accepted. On our way the the aquarium we needed a pick me up and noticed this beautiful coffee shop.  Our crme brle iced lattes were delicious and hit the spot.  Adorable open air atmosphere and I loved the plants.  I wish this shop was close to our Airbnb.","Monday: 7:30 AM – 6:00 PM

Still though, a nice place to visit. Seems like a trendy place and a nice place to have if you don't want to deal with the cramped food shops.

Perfect place if you want a sit down after your wife has shopped until we dropped.

Service could be quicker.

I had the salmon cheese baguette, lacked taste, was probably vegan. The burgers tasted amazing, they are on the smaller side compared to AmericanAustralian standards as I ordered a large.
The service was quite upsetting, I felt that because we were foreigners maybe they had something against us or a bad experience? Not sure but everyone around us had been given water with their meals except us, there was a station with jugs and glasses of water and when we poured some at our table the wait staff got upset and said we werent supposed to. We apologized but we were just after some water with our food and at the time there was no staff around to ask. Additionally we ordered some fish which came in a little metal dish covered in oil with some bread on the side, we were not given any cutlery or chopsticks to dish the fish onto the bread and when I politely asked the waitress she rudely said that you need to use the bread. I have never written a negative review before and have had such a positive experience so far in Japan and this actually upset me a little. Would just like to add that the male waiter was lovely.  I thought the price was good.  Updated 12152023

Been a long time patron dating back over 6 years, so it is really sad that I have to leave such a negative review.

Food 45 Fresh ingredients and food tastes good
Service 25 Servers gossiping instead of making the rounds
Value 35 Lunch sets doesn't include drinks
Ambiance 45

Went back after 6 months from my last visit.

The entrance on the side was closed, not sure if management is trying to shut this location down on purpose.

Arrived around 1110AM, online menu ordering system was not up and running and had to bring that up with the server,  server wasn't too receptive about my feedback.

Ordered food around 1117AM, servers were just gossiping around given that the establishment was completely empty.

Food arrived around 1132AM, as always the food seemed appetizing and all the ingredients were fresh.

Had to ask for mustard on the side given that the restaurant no longer carries the Heinz mustard packs that used to be served along with the silverware and the single pack of Heinz ketchup.

Went to make a payment, there is a touch free reader that clearly can read RFID equipped credit cards, was told that it wasn't functional.  Kind of unexpected after all of these months, guess their system upgrade cycle must be every 3 years or longer, more and more establishments accept touch free payment methods.

Also mentioned to the cashier that the side door was not open and that from the outside the building prospective customers could not tell if the establishment was open for business.  Cashier did not seem to be too interested about my comments.

Such a shame to see this establishment performing so poorly, if you want to be treated like you are back in the US dining at an establishment that is been manned by tweens, then Brooklyn Parlor is your place. The burgers are still good but that is about it, don't expect service that matches the quality of the food.

Previous review from 2019

Food 45 Fresh ingredients
Service 45 Good service when not crowded
Value 45 Good value, best values are the lunch setsspecials
Ambiance 45 Loft style, individual and shared tables seating along with sofa seating

Had a chance to try out the new Japanese lunch set at Brooklyn Parlor, everything on the tray was fresh and tasted great, the finishing touches were a bit off since the salad dressing wasn't distributed uniformly.  Other than that the kitchen staff did a great job.

The Root Salad has been revamped slightly with the dressing been served on the side instead of been included when the salad used to be tossed. The brownie and French toast were really delicious. I was kinda disappointed with the creme brle. It was really watery inside, felt like just eating sweet liquid , and the top layer wasnt crunchy at all. In terms of the environment, I think its quite spacious and the seats are comfortable. I really hate the music in the daytime
Edit the music is better now. But the coffee is very bitter and not tasty despite being 750 yen. 
Great burgers as always though!!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM

The pancakes was amazing, had the classic pancakes and they were very good. They didn't have French toast at the time but hopefully when I come next time they will. The place is small but very cozy very chic. If it's crowded, there are two lines, so be mindful when you walk up. I also had the ice mocha and the croque madame. Loved the croquet but the ice mocha had too much milk but still very delicious. Overall great place to visit when you come to Osaka and want some western style breakfast. Maybe I just didnt choose a great dish but the food was not good. I had the fried egg bacon cheese sandwich with salad on the side. The salad was just undressed spring greens, plate decoration really. The sandwich looked good but was incredibly rich. The bread is fried in butter, with butter heavily spread on the insides as well, plus the cheese in the sandwich. I couldnt stomach it. I had a good experience, however I think I may have ordered the wrong thing. The Avacado toast was a little funny  the bread they use reminded me of banana bread. It is very sweet and moist which threw the flavor of the dish off for me. However the latte was very good and the service was as well. I arrived at 1145am and waited in the queue for 1hr 15 minutes. With such a long line and all the amazing reviews, I was excited for an amazing meal. Honestly, in the end, it was average and a little disappointing. Once I got inside, I didn't wait long to be served my food which was great because I was ready for food haha. Everyone was hard at work, and the service was very nice. I got the pancakes, bacon, and eggs. The bacon was crispy but very greasy. The eggs needed seasoning, and the pancakes were just everyday normal pancakes. I also got the cookies milkshake, which was very good. I feel like this place was over hyped. I would come back to eat here again, but I wouldn't wait in line unless it was an under 10 minute wait. A fantastic little breakfast place in Osaka. It's a bit hard to find a place open before 10am in Osaka, so this place is a life saver. I got a pancake set while my partner got a croque madame, and they were both delicious. The staff was fast, attentive, and polite, and the atmosphere was great. A, I'd definitely go again.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM

Wish there were more selections for espresso only two. Went with the Ethiopian. Given the quality of single origin, was definitely overpriced. The pour over game however, appears well worth it. I'll be going back to try others.
It is a take out cafe, best be prepared for that as there are no seats.
Staff really know what they are doing and take their time to hear your needs and aid you in the selection. They are warm and inviting.  Was definitely worth the detour. Probably one of the more impressive coffee experiences I've ever had. Masa and his team are a phenomenal example of what specialty coffee truly is. A tiny space, using absolutely every single inch to its fullest, jammed in with an L5 and Linea. The pourover of Takesi was likely the best cup of coffee Ive had in a year. Huge kudos to his team and to the business and shop theyve built, and thank you for being so kind and a wonderful example for our industry. we ordered 2 cups. the ruiru is good and fruity. and the other geisha with long name is just typical geisha taste with unpleasant starbucks americano aftertaste 

Mels Caf The perfect spot for delicious cappuccino and impromptu photo shoots!

After two weeks of caffeinated exploration through Tokyo, Nagoya, and Kyoto, I finally stumbled upon Mels Caf and discovered a truly delightful cappuccino  definitely worth the 700 Yen! The blend was rich and velvety, making it the best Ive had in Japan so far.

However, a couple of things kept this experience from being perfect. First, they serve their amazing cappuccino in a paper cup. Because who wouldn't want to sip a delicious, meticulously crafted drink out of something thats typically reserved for office coffee? Its a bit like serving a gourmet meal on a paper plate  just doesnt do it justice! Plus, not exactly a win for sustainability.

Secondly, the caf seems to be a hotspot for the youngsters social media enthusiasts. Expect a backdrop of camera clicks and selfies galore. Its like being in the middle of a spontaneous photo shoot. So, if youre looking for a quiet place to enjoy your coffee, you might want to bring noisecanceling headphones.

All in all, Mels serves up a fantastic cappuccino worth trying, even if you have to drink it from a paper cup while dodging selfie sticks. If they switched to real cups and toned down the photo ops, it would be a 5star experience for sure! The service was next level! I absolutely enjoyed the coffee. The barista was very kind to recommend me some coffee beans and gave me a very thorough introduction of each kind. If you are a coffee lover, this is a must go!","Monday: Closed

The tiramsu and iced coffee were very high quality and fresh. Nice coffee shop to take a break in Desserts were delicious, got the oreo caramel croffle, tiramisu latte and cat pudding in my photo. They don't sell pasta or any other meals, just desserts and beverages.

Came at around 12pm on sat and there were several empty tables for 2 and around 2 empty tables were 3 or 4. Opposite of fresh farm.

Service was nice, its a serene and cosy place to chill!  love the plants and korean RB music! Extremely nice and cozy place. The strawberry croffle and tiramisu mocha were both extremely delightful! Theres also a cute photo spot in the corner of the cafe that I recommend trying! Nice Korean style cafe. Popular with the younger crowd teens  early twenties. The coffee is good and the sweets are good and are a decent size.

Service could be better. I've been here twice once with a friend and once alone. The first time the staff were okay but the second time, they were kind of rude. No greetings and just shoved the English menu in my face  not every foreigner is a tourist. Later on, they were all sitting down,looking at their phones.

Both times, there was this funky, unwelcoming vibe like some reviewers mentioned. Kinda contrasts with the stylish and chill decor. Won't be going back. Hard to chill with negative vibes. Cute food tho'! Stylish cafe with a variety of drinks and desserts. Out of the way of the hustle and bustle of Doutonburi, but still nearby, this cafe is also surrounded by other restaurants and bars.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:30 PM

Sakimoto Bakery cafe,"Japan, 〒556-0011 Osaka, Naniwa Ward, Nanbanaka, 2-chōme−3−１８ 2階",4.1,34.6627599,135.5035586,"We ordered almost everything on the breakfast menu and loved it all. We were happily surprised at the cafe space when it opened and we were seated right when it opened at 9 am. Good thing we got there early as it is a very popular place and it fills up quickly. The food was fresh and everything was delicious. If we had been in Osaka for one more day, we would have gone back for lunch but we ran out of time and couldn't make it back! This was my favorite place in our time in Osaka. Highly recommend going here and get there early! A nice hangout place for a morning breakfast.

The toasts are nicely made with soft and sweet bread. The toppings are a little off in their spices as my egg for my French toast is kinda salty.

Overall, it is a worth place to visit and the wait isnt that long even if you did not reserve.

Not sure if reservation is possible. Cute little cafe, known as no 1 cafe to visit in osaka from many reviews. The place is indeed very cute, with a little garden on the entrance of the 2nd floor. The bread is soft and nice, and a little expensive too. The food took quite long to come out and by the time we were there at 2.30pm, most of menu were sold out. The earl grey jam is so good and I bought 1 bottle of it to bring home.  They also have different place in the same road for bakery only and coffee only. I bought some breads at the bakery and most of them are nice. The red bean butter bread and truffle salt bread are nice Their bread is a bit sweet and its the best part of it!!!
We really loved their bread!
You can get a discount for the bakery downstairs if you dine in!

Youll need to order your food by scanning the QR code on your table.
I highly recommend you make a reservation for lunch! A nice and cozy coffee shop with delicious breakfast options, however, I wish they also served the items of the bakery at the cafe. In the morning, they only provide a limited set of options to have on site, mostly involving toast or croissant, the items of their bakery downstairs are not included. The atmosphere is super nice and chilled, being a great option for a brunch on a rainy Sunday like I did. Make sure to arrive early as it can get pretty crowded!","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

My partner ordered brown sugar latte and he said it was so good.
Their egg sandwich is really good too, we had to comeback the next day to have more.
If you are in the area, we suggest you come and try their food. Loved the breakfast today. It was home away from home. They have Assam tea and bread butter. I was craving Assam tea and bread butter for breakfast and I found it here. I also ordered the egg sandwich. Everything I ordered was simply tasteful. The person at the cafe made them carefully and spoke very good English. I had requested to give some milk along with the tea. He also interacted with me.  It was a lovely morning and a soul satisfying breakfast. Thank you. Absolutely wonderful food! Had an amazing apple pie that everyone should have alongside their lunchdinner. They may not speak English but the food did the talking.

There is an English menu if you ask though. It's a nice small cozy place with not too many seats but good for 2 person party stopping by. Best apple pie! The taste of the whipped cream plus ice cream plus pie perfectly melts in your mouth YUM YUM me  my friend actually ate this after enjoying katsu curry rice there is always room for dessert

 clean toilets We had the delightful experience of this cafe. Their warm welcome and lovely food makes this quite simply the best cafe in Osaka.","Monday: Closed

The tart's balance of the sweet apple, crumbly biscuits and flavoured cream was perfection. The quiet atmosphere  on a lazy Sunday afternoon was just right. The staff were very friendly and helpful especially because my Japanese is very limited. Cozy spot with funky retro music. Coffee was delicious, cookie cups were the right amount of sweet. Our 8 yo said it was the best cafe shes been to. The barista noticed her seal bag and created a latte art in the form of a seal face A cafe in Osaka located close to the river. The waitress was quite helpful and kind. Their coffee and strawberry milk were tasty. Their famous cookie cup was cute but not tasty as expected, it's just for the gimmick. Such a fun thing to have an edible espresso cup! My wife got a macchiato with very cute latte art, and I got an espresso shot in the edible cup to balance out the sweetness. So fun!

Went to many places during my 1 month in Japan and this was the most convoluted reservation system I encountered to the point where I just gave up. Restaurant was totally empty btw Specialty Cafe which is affiliated with the animation company Ufotable. And no, Emiya will not be serving food today. Their Menu is not that diverse but the quality of service is very good. Note that at the time of visit, there was no support of English in the menu, so making sure what to order beforehand there is a menu outside with pictures will help trouble later on. Enjoyed my visit, would recommend for people willing to cash out a bit more for a parfait. Service is excellent, atmosphere is really chilled and the dining area has two projector screens. One showed a selection of currently airing anime, one at the time was showing Kimetsu no Yaiba. Good range of items to buy inside for Fate and other ufotable shows. Prices are a little high for what you get, but this is par for the course with themed cafes. Foreign travellers be aware that there is only a Japanese menu. Needs reserve and doesn't serve food without it but has a nice goods shop and the way they treat their fidelity clients filled my heart with joy. Friendly staff, food is quite good. Be sure to have enough cash with you! Cash only!","Monday: Closed

Cat cafe MoCHA (Mocha) Osaka Shinsaibashi,"Japan, 〒542-0083 Osaka, Chuo Ward, Higashishinsaibashi, 1-chōme−18−１１ LIBERTY心斎橋ビル１Ｆ",3.9,34.6736935,135.503027,"They have special breeds of cats. Super cute and fluffy. Down side is the price. We paid 5000yen for 1 hour, including 2 lollipop cat snacks. The drinks are included and unlimited from the machines. The drinks taste ok. Nothing compared to freshmade ones. I can imagine this place gets very crowded during busy hours, and its hard to get cats attention.

They also have a collection of manga. I think this was a cute experience, the cats werent too shy and some were friendly and let you pet them. I went in for 30 minutes which was around 1000 yen and you should keep track of your time as they dont remind you and you pay extra if you go over time. The free drinks were refreshing! You have to take your shoes off and put your bag in a locker. The staff are friendly and sweet. One of my fave pet cafes so far because the cats interact more and are more curious  it also looks like they are groomed well and taken care of. My favourite one was the Maine coon, Milo!

Im not sure if there is an adoption option so that cat lovers can have a chance to adopt a pet local and overseas. I think it would create a more positive environment to help cats find a home and loving family rather than being in a pet cafe for the rest of their lives  A cat cafe that works very differently from any cat cafe I'm used to from my homeland. You pay here by the time you spend inside, and during that time, you can get any drink from a vending machine for free, but you have to pay extra for cat treats. Even a short visit is a bit expensive, though. But the place is very nice and clean, and the staff is friendly. A great setup, very relaxing and interactive environment. Also very clean.

The cats are treated well and saw them being rotated out of the room. They can also go vertically to get away from the people if needed.

A great place to relax with cats but dont expect snuggles or attention, these cats know they are the stars and interact on their terms. There is an option to buy treats if you want to buy their affection. Cats look healthy and very well cared for. A little pricey but if youve got a cat lover in the group that needs a feline fix this is a good spot.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Had the iced latte both days as it was superb. Tried the cheese toast, beef pastrami sandwich and the peach sandwich. All were delicious but the main standout was the peach sandwich.
The combination of flavors was just fantastic. Sweet, fragrant, creamy and salty from the ham. The bread was crispy and fluffy as well. What a great dish.

Pro tip come early as seats are limited and waiting time can drag to 1 hour if the place is full.

Definitely worth a visit. Amazing coffee and a lot of food choices, especially for brunch, like some awesome Japanesestyle sandwiches.

There's also an English menu card available.

The space is not too big, but couples can find a place to sit in the few tables.

The coffee was one of the best I had in Osaka.

Only negative is that the air inside might smell of food because there's an open cuisine, and that smell can stay on your clothes. Also, while I was there, they were cutting onions and we all started tearing up in the shop like someone had thrown a tear gas bomb  My favourite cafe from my trip at Osaka. Ordered the matcha latte and cafe latte with hazelnut and both were so good.

Cheese toast, turkey eggs and maple French toast were also very delicious.

Highly highly recommend! A cafe with great coffee best I had in Osaka this trip and yummy brunch options  Came here for breakfast and I loved everything about this place!  I had the french toast which was crunchy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. I also had the raspberry matcha latte which was super delicious and not too sweet. On top of that, everything looked amazing and the latte art on my boyfriend's latte was the prettiest i've ever seen. The atmosphere was amazing and the staff was super friendly and made us feel comfortable. Even though the food took a little while to be prepared, that didn't take anything away from the experience and most likely just proves have freshly everything is being prepared. Highly recommend to check this place out!  Delicious breakfast spot  we'll be coming back tomorrow. The iced latte was one of the best coffees I've had. The cheesy toast, tuna sandwich and iced matcha latte were excellent too.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

When we entered, one of the waitresses greeted us, and we sat down on an outdoor patio overlooking a river. The atmosphere of this place is phenomenal, while we waited for our food, we looked out and admired the view. I ordered the avocado toast and my daughter ordered the caramel banana pancake. I really appreciate that they had two menus, one in Japanese and one in English, so it was easy to order. The food only took about 15 minutes. I LOVED the pancakes!! Japanese pancakes are so fluffy and light, with the chopped bananas and caramel toppings. The avocado toast was average. It was still very fresh though, but its not something I would order again. Overall, I enjoyed this experience and would definitely come here again. This place is absolutely beautiful and relaxing to enjoy a quality meal with a stunning view. Originally I was a bit worried about the review, but then I realized that people gave one star reviews just because they waited too long for their food. Go to McDonanld if you are in a hurry and let other people enjoy this place. Its better to come when they just open at 7 AM though. I have seen long lines of people waiting to get in. Food looks and tastes great! We came in within the hour of opening on a Friday morning. Would've appreciated some coffee art. We went to a cafe in Tokyo that gave us both coffee art and the total bill was less than this place. And unfortunately, they only had avocado toast and no other toast on their menu. Okay, I just being honest. The foods and drinks are just fine. It is pretty standard that you could probably just get it from any shops that sell the same thing.
But I still give 5 stars, not for other reason, but just for the pretty waitress! She seems like my type! The shrimp sandwich soup set is really good. Its fresh and not overrated at all. The ambiance is also really nice! Plus points cuz this place opens at 7 am! Perfect for early risers like me","Monday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM

5 stars!!   

This place is a MUST visit for anyone in Osaka, vegan or not!   The vibe is incredible  super chill with tons of wood, natural light, and killer music.  The staff are super friendly and laidback, making it the perfect spot to relax and enjoy a delicious meal.

Speaking of delicious...the food here is to DIE for!  I'm not even vegan, but their fusion dishes are mindblowing.  We had to try one of their ""outofthisworld"" sandwiches, and it did not disappoint!  Seriously, the best sandwich I've ever had vegan or not.

The cafe itself is super cute and conveniently located in central Osaka.  Perfect for a break from sightseeing or a relaxing lunch date.  This place has everything  amazing food, awesome atmosphere, and friendly staff.  Don't miss it!


Update Went back for the Veggie burger and Iced Chai and wow  again! I had BLT sandwich it was juicy and very delicious. It had lots of  salads, tomatos, thick bacon and side maple syrup. Bread was buttery. Only side carrots were not good
Cappucino and latte was also very good.
Mango bowl, mango tart amazing also. Cold and refreshing.
Its not very cheap but good food! They have 90 min seating rule and queues. Best breakfast in Osaka!
We dined in, but I loved the idea that they let you rent picnic gear with takeout so you can enjoy in a nearby park.
We both got sandwiches, ricotta pancakes, and I got the banana espresso smoothie. Incredible food and everyone was so nice! The line was long but only took about 20 minutes.
We ordered through a QR code on my phone that had and English option. Best breakfast before heading to Osaka Castle. Its an Aussie style breakfast. We got ricotta pancakes and MBLT maple syrup sandwich. Perfectly portioned, bread was great, what looks like pickled carrots on the side was a good addition, and the strawberries were very sweet. Best of all coffee was strong. Hot chai with shot of espresso was a delight. One of the best breakfast cafes Ive ever been to. Toast is good, first time it came roasted Angus is well done but the picture was medium rare and the picture is looks more nicer than the real food , after I told them they changed it. Then its fine.

Pancake is okay, cute like egg cloud. I think thats egg white mix with some pancakes power liquid , so you can feel two texture, highly not recommend that order the banana blueberry pancake one

I saw their peeled banana didnt use protect cover to cover the surface area of the banana,  full of peeled bananas box put on the other full of peeled bananas  box top box bottom is dirty, and put it on the peeled bananas  half of bananas is turning grey, ill .  I saw the 4 eyes girl didnt wear groves to touch the banana and put it in fridge without cover. Unhygienic  easy to tummy pain

The space is not very large, so the atmosphere is nice and friendly. It is quiet and peaceful, a nice experience worth to have. Amazing place!
Mame shibas are cute and unaware. Try to enjoy them by themselves. Trying to force any kind of interaction might ruin the experience.
Choose any drink and watch them until one of them reaches you. The staff is always helping and might help you if theres any chance.
Remember mame shibas are not puppies, theyre small but theyre grown up, and each with different personality. Not the greatest Shiba cafe , there are a lot of rules that you wouldn't find in other Shiba cafes. There are rules like no touching the dogs anywhere other than their chest. You must sit on the sides of the room  can't go into the center of the room etc. There were no toys , so you just sit there and watch the dogs while they sit in the center if the room.  if you're looking for a Shiba cafe I recommend trying other places. It was a cute experience but its quite a small space for people to cram and sit around just to try and get attention from the dogs. The staff were informative and helpful but most of the dogs were just not interested. One of the staff members were friendly and kind so thank you for the chat! It would be ideal if there was a bigger play area for them and more space for people to sit and interact. I understand the Shiba Inu is quite shy and cautious so it was interesting to learn this and get to know a Japanese breed like this.

Im not sure if there is an option to adopt the dogs local and overseas but I think it could be great to incorporate that option for dog lovers so that some of the dogs can find a happy and loving home rather than just trying to entertain people all day. We could come in straight away, no waiting line! The dogs were very shy, but the staff was very good to make them play with you and showed us some tricks!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 6:00 PM

The preparation of the tea was also meticulously done, with the sweet candied fruits prepared on ceramic chips. Each serving of tea is truly an artwork of its own.

Here was what we ordered
 Matcha latte  milky, smooth
 Iced hojicha  smoky and bitter, I really like the intensity of this cool and refreshing drink
 Hojichai  Chai made with hojicha, warm and flavourful spices mixed with the earthiness of the tea
 Kakigori  very refreshing for a hot day. I added condensed milk to make it sweeter.

A must visit for tea and pottery lovers.
 Cozy place for a rest with your dessert  tea.
Ive been travelling around Osaka and recover from super tired by spending an hour here.
Peaceful vibe. Nice food. Beautiful setting. I ordered the shaved ice with Japanese black tea syrup comes with one refill, which came with a cup of hojicha for 1200 yen. The gentle and delicate flavor of the black tea syrup was an unexpected and pleasant surprise. The hojicha was very smooth and comforting as well. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Highly recommended. After waiting about 15 min in the heat for it to open, I was really shocked when I walked inside and saw there were already about 10 loud foreignerstour group? inside. I assumed they had some private event and would be leaving but I was surprised when they began to sit down at the same time as well. Luckily I was able to get a seat, but I felt bad for others who showed up before opening time and could not get a seat. They were very loud and even the noise cancellation on my AirPods could not drown them out. I thought that at a cafe style like this, the staff would ask them to keep their voice down, but they did not. When they left, the mood immediately changed and I could feel the calm atmosphere I was looking for. I hope if this cafe lets in private group tours early, they could make it end before the public comes in.

However, the tea was wonderful. The summer tea was very clean and refreshing and it paired well with the savory grilled mochi which was also delicious. It was a bit expensive, but I was able to drink multiple glasses of tea from the pitcher. The presentation was also very beautiful. wad is probably my fave! I loved my time here, the staff were so accommodating. I got the matcha and chose my own matcha bowl.","Monday: 12:00 – 7:00 PM

From the photos here on Google, we expected a wider variety of dishes than just bowls, but the menu seems to change. We had the Optimus Buddha Bowl, Spring Buddha Bowl, and fried soy meat. The food and drinks were excellent I recommend it. Nice view of the river. Excellent place for vegetarian and vegans. We took a cab from the osaka palace, cost about 1100 jpy. It's a small eating place like many Japanese restaurants. Total about 25 seats, mostly indoor and 8  outdoor sitting. The outdoor seats along the river view that's nice and windy. The serving portion is just nice. It's delicious and well presented. Service is great. Highly recommended. Lovely bistro beside the river. Since it was a bit busy and we weren't informed that we needed to order using a QR code, the service was first a little slow, but that was to be expected. The meal was amazing and of the highest quality. Possibly one of the nicest lunches I had while in Japan. The soy meat was cooked nicely, with just the right amount of batter and not too much grease, leaving it lovely and crunchy with a perfect seasoning. All the vegetables were so fresh that you could taste the quality. great, fresh ingredients were used, and there was a great seating space with a soothing view. In addition, the chocolate cake was excellent, with really highquality chocolate. The ideal way to finish a meal. Suggested for both meat eaters and vegans! Great fresh menu with vegan options that doesnt feel like a compromise on creativity and flavor.
Outdoor terrace has an amazing view to the river. Went to Optimus Cafe a few times when we were in Osaka.

One time we ordered the corn fritters to share. Then I had the Optimus Buddah Bowl with an orange juice set, and the fried soy meat plate was also ordered.

Another time we shared the kaarage, then I had the kaarage pita bread and the soy milk ramen was also ordered.

Honestly, always a good meal here, and the staff are lovely. Also, if you're lucky enough, you will get a seat right on the balcony overlooking the canalwaterfront, which is absolutely lovely.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 5:00 PM

After reading previous reviews, we expected a possibly unpleasant time, but everyone in the cafe provided excellent service. My Japanese is choppy, but everyone spoke English pretty well. The menu also had English.

There are few around 4 tables in Cafe Arabiq and once they are full, they obviously cant seat any more people. Be prepared to be turned away if they are full up. It really isnt you, its them. Theyve built a small mythology online, so they keep busy it seems. Coming early is your best bet.

I ordered the MariaTheresia, a coffee cocktail of sorts, that contained orange liquer, absolutely delicious whipped cream, and adorable konpeito. I loved it. We also order a premium coffee and the quality was high. They also had denki bran and their food looked tasty, so perhaps next time. After the coffee, I browsed the dolls and wished I could buy everything. The gentleman working was very kind and informative.

TLDR Tasty drinks in an eclectic environment. Super busy, so be patient. Definitely worth going to, especially if dolly stuff is an aesthetic you enjoy. This is truly a oneofakind cafe! There are bookshelves lining the shop and really interesting art on display, which apparently changes every couple of months. The owner makes incredible drinks try the Maria Theresa! Or the rum coffee and the waitress is super friendly. Great place to sit down with a book or a coffee and a long chat. It seems super cozy. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I just came from another cafe and wanted to browse the books here...thinking it was a bookshop. We wanted to order tea to support the local business, but they have a rule where you need to order 1 drink per person. It's totally understandable but since I thought it was a book shop, I didn't want to pay 12 yen just to browse the books. On the other hand, if you have time to sit in relax, it looks like a comfy place. A comfy cafe in a beautiful old house. A good collection of a bit dark and mysterious dolls and paints is exhibited for sale. It'll remind you of the world of Pan's Labyrinth. The ginger coffee was delicious and the interior of the shop was really interesting and unique. Also appreciated the kind service.",no operation time,"art_gallery, cafe, book_store, point_of_interest, home_goods_store, store, food, establishment"

From grilled cheese sandwiches to poutine to salad and homemade muffins and smoothie and drinks they have an impressive array of delicious food and you can tell that its a community place. Super nice canadian owner, lots of vegan  vegetarian options available. Grilled cheese with tomato soup and the balsamic veggie sandwich were super tasty. Great atmosphere too! One of few places you can get a poutine here in Osaka. The owner is Canadian and it really nice! Cafe has some board games and a good selection of sandwiches. Deserts vary and there are other snacks available. We found the cafe while Googling for a brunch place nearby our hotel. We loved the ambience cozy yet not cramped, and the Christmas decor had a really nice touch! Had a lovely chat with the owner and his wife while dining, went back for a second visit because we loved the place!

The portion of grilled sandwiches were definitely worth for its price. Would recommend the grilled sandwich with gorgonzola cheese  Shimeiji mushrooms.

Would definitely visit this cafe on my next trip to Osaka! Been here 4 times over the 2 trips we made to Japan. Its has become a muststop for us when we are visiting Japan. A mixture of Canadian and Japanese hospitality is an experience on itself. The food is great and well worth it. We will come back again to this awesome place!","Monday: Closed

I got the typical sandwich from the store. It was a sandwich cut into three pieces with roasted chicken, lettuce, egg salad and some slight mustard sauce. The bread is quite delicious, but the sauce drips out of it which made it a little messy and the chicken is a little dry. It comes with a little salad mix. Not bad for only 680. Great simple cheap breakfast in 24 hour diner. We went to Bread Espresso  Sakaisuji previously and liked this place more. The tea is loose leaf and comes with a bone china cup and saucer better than BES and the hot dog is lovely! Good place for breakfast, not much options but does the trick for some simple sandwiches and pancakes. Visited the Bakuromachi location. Nice relaxing place with reasonable prices. The blend coffee was smooth. Ordering is via 2D code with your mobile to save on staff costs, but the service was still good. There is a smoking section if you require it. Had the typical ""morning"" breakfast toast, coffee and a salad. Taste was good for the price. Open 24 hrs. Other places near our hotel to get a ""morning"" breakfast opened by 800 or later. Pancake slightly hard, overall good and not a must try coffee place.

I tried the Cafe Au Lait and it was exactly what I expected. I accompanied it with a brownie which was elegantly served and tasted delicious.

Overall, I highly recommend giving this place a visit next time youre in Osaka. Beautiful cafe with incredible coffee  quality food. Best coffee I've had in Osaka. Recommend going early, as it fills up very quickly! Nova is a stylish caf with a rustic and Japanesestyle interior. The cafe has a calm atmosphere and delicious red bean paste toast for breakfast.

The young man who instructed my kids and husband was fluent in English, super friendly, and had a lot of knowledge and skills. He was so nice to my 7 and 8 year olds. We had a great time. Highly recommend booking an experience here! WE HAD THE BEST TIME!!!

Our family of four kids 11 and 14 had a wonderful experience. Our Ninja Master Seiya taught us the ways of the ninja and gave us skills in throwing stars, blow darts and Katana. Afterwards we ate like Ninjas.

Seiyas infectious laugh and encouragement made the experience unforgettable. Definitely recommend this to any families looking for a fun activity. Not just for kids! We had such a fun time learning to be ninjas and eating yummy food. Couldn't have asked for a better instructor  Seiya was fun with such a great attitude! Was such a great experience our 12 year old loved it. Highly recommend.
We did not order food so can not comment on food but the experience was our sons highlight. We have done axe throwing in the US  and I wondered in ""Ninja star"" throwing thing was a thing.  Google brought me to this place.  Super fun! We are two adults  no kids  and had a blast. The two employees were enthusiastic and great! Loved dressings up as ninjas and doing stars, blowguns, and swords. Whole experience was just under an hour.  A nice personal experience with just our party.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

finished the meal off with 2 of their stunning cakes in the case strawberry cake and old fashioned pudding both were wonderful! This cafe is so far my favorite. I've been to all of their branches in Namba, in Nakazakicho near umeda and this one their main branch. It has a homemy vibe that makes you want to stay longer unless it's not crowded. These are one of the delicious food on their menu. I ordered Canele ,  assorted baked goods , homemade lemonade . Such a cute and cozy caf! So happy I found it on google maps, before our trip to japan. The drinks and food were as amazing as I had hoped. Super cute retro cafe.

The food was magnificent, the vibe was amazing and breakfast was perfect and delicious cakes. Must visit breakfast and lunch spot! What a great breakfast spot. The food was amazing, the service was fantastic, and the decor and vibe next level This Caf sets a standard for what a french toast can be. Im looking forward to coming here again one day. This cafe is such a gem!  From the decor to the food to the hot beverages, its really a fantastic find!  The tables are all old footpedal sewing machines the tea and coffee mugs are absolutely gorgeous fine china the plates are Le Creuset the decor reminds me of what my grandmother tells me her grandmothers house looked like and the music ranged from lovely 20s jazz to early rock and roll.  The black tea was very high quality and the coffee was expertly blended.  The pieces of bread on the breakfast menu were huge and fluffy!  Do yourself a favor and treat all your senses at this fine cafe.  Itll be the best decision you make all week! This place sets the bar really high!

Im quite picky when it comes to curry  especially when it uses many spices  and
I was a little skeptical when it said the curry is made with Japanese dashi.
But it was soooo goooood. The combination of Japanese taste and curry spices worked out perfectly.

The space is also very comfy with nice decorations and staff are friendly.

With over a century of serving locals and visitors, it offers a unique blend of tradition and quality. The coffee here is incredibly strong, brewed to perfection with a rich, bold flavor thats perfect for coffee lovers who appreciate a robust cup. The donuts are a perfect complementfresh, fluffy, and delicious with just the right amount of sweetness. The atmosphere exudes nostalgia, making it a charming spot to relax and take in a piece of Osakas history. Highly recommend! Hiraoka Coffee is one of the oldest coffee shops in Osaka. The black coffee was nothing short of exceptional. Brewed to perfection, it boasted a rich, robust flavor with just the right balance of bitterness and acidity. The aroma alone was enough to awaken my senses. The donut was a perfect compliment to the coffee. The texture was something very new to me in super enjoyable ways, hard to describe but thick moist a bit chewy. So delicious One of the oldest cafe in Osaka. They still making coffee and donuts with old appliances. The atmosphere is cozy and nostalgic. The place is small so there is chance you can not get a chair.

I tried their 100year blend coffee, their original signature that has been served for a century. The taste is not strong, but relaxing enough. Together with their signature donuts which is more like a cake, making the coffee taste really good.

If you have time, you should try this place. The gentleman who greeted us and took our orders, an older gentleman who certainly looked like he owned the place  was very hospitable. Welcoming and warm he was.

Warm legendary cup. Cold Windy Osaka morning. Sipping history. Chances upon this shop and intrigue with the 100 year old tag! A small lovely joint and very friendly English speaking owner.

Ordered the Columbia medium roast and donut. The coffee is grind and tasted beautiful, full body and aroma. The donut is on the harder type but goes well with the coffee.

Going to make this my regular joint!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 2:30 PM

You can't sit in the cafe lounge area in the lobby without ordering something. Then, they didn't even have the dessert I thought I could stomach cheese cake so I tried this shitty piece pictured here.
Every time I stepped into the caferestaurantbar area they acted like they owned me. Their idea of service in this area of Japan is ordering you around. I'm a Hilton honors member and I'll bet I can just stay at other places In a member at like Marriott, Hyatt, or elsewhere next time. This hotel in general sucks. Super pretentious here. Food is good, but the atmosphere was awesome because they have great onsite singers. Services were top of the line as well. I dont usually mention names in my reviews but this time I think I really have to do so.

Came to have afternoon tea with my wife and 2 year old son, my son was pretty loud and out of control but the the staff Ms.Mori was really professional and took great care of us , gave us an isolated seat so we wouldnt be bothering other customers and she really made us feel like home.

The food was very tasty, but the service was exceptional, really appreciated.

Thank you for the great service. I happened to be at the Hilton Osaka on vacation this week and the two evenings I spent relaxing at the bar after long days of walking were highlights of the trip.

The whole staff was great, and the live jazz performers were top notch and took requests, but Shigematsu, the bartender, was incredible. He was very attentive, well humored, and was able to come up with amazing drinks when I asked him to 'go off menu'. Would absolutely recommend this place for a great cocktailevening. Had lunch, drinks, dinner, and breakfast at MyPlace during our recent stay at the Hilton Osaka.  Favorites were the MyBurger ordered it twice, Pork Ramen, Shrimp and Avocado sandwich, Black Forrest Gateaux, Alond, Pear  Raspberry Tart, among others.  Must also try the house cocktail, Chivas Mizunara Whisky. Attentive and courteous staff.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 12:00 AM

The coffee was very mid, and the coffee jelly wasn't very good. But they have ample seating for a coffee shop, which was very uncommon for us during our coffee expeditions in Japan. We only came here because the coffee shop we wanted to try was closed. If you need a place to chill, this checks that box, but if you are searching for good coffeejelly this isn't it. It IS better than Starbucks though. Large space to sit and relax. Desserts are great. Coffee was good but a little on the milky side. Staff very friendly Nice atmosphere but not my kind of coffee. Ordered cappuccino with oat milk.. way too much milk. I cannot even taste the coffee. It's way too milky.

My friend ordered hot Americano and it was served at room temperatureit wasn't crowded at that time. They were nice enough to make us another cup.

So 2 stars for coffee and 4 stars for service and atmosphere Cafe Saturdays NYC in Osaka is a trendy place for a coffee break. The cappuccino was fantastic, rich and smooth in texture, perfectly balanced with the rich taste of the espresso. The foam is soft and just the right temperature. The vegan matcha sesame cookie was also excellent, moist and soft with a mix of flavours. If you like match you need to try it! Thank me later. The atmosphere is perfect for getting some work done, with plenty of power sockets and a good wifi connection, although I had a few hiccups while I was there. All in all, a great place to grab a drink, a snack and get some work done. If you have time go upstairs and shop some fancy clothes. Will definitely come back in the future. Cool cafe.

It was a bit dense on the inside not the fluffy kind. As you pair it with the cold cream and fruits, every mouthful was well balanced with the sweetness of the cream and pancake and slight sourness of the fruits. It doesnt leave a starchy aftertaste as well. A quiet cafe to relax and kickback after much walking around the malls. The shop was a bit hidden and hard to find if you're not from the area but I'm very glad to have discovered it! Very delicious pancakes, they were soft and had a fluffy texture. I would definitely recommend trying the strawberry pancakes! The server was also very kind and took his time to explain the menu. Overall a very pleasant experience. Visited on 6th January 2021 lunch time. Although there are only five lunch dishes in the menu included one pasta. The food are really great. Delicious, nutritious, rare to see, with enough volume. They put some citrus in the water. You can feel the friendliness from the staff. If they provided a little butter or jam for the toast, that will make the gratin dish perfect. The price is acceptable. Superior restaurant with balance nutrition. Worth to visit again and again and deserve recommendation. Visited this place in a group mixed with foreigners and 1 other Japanese. I ordered their seasonal peach pancake, but even after my friends had finished their meal, the pancake was not served. They did not miss taking my order since the staff clearly mentioned tea for cake set when serving my tea. So when we checked with the only male staff working during this period on our order, he told us that the peach pancake was finished, and recommended us to order the other pancake. I ultimately ordered peach shortcake instead. As we were about to leave the cafe, we saw the table near ours with two Japanese young ladies being served the very same peach pancake. So we asked the same male staff why it was not served to us, which he responded with a single liner that because the pancake took time. If that is the case, why recommend another pancake to us? It is alright to admit that you missed our order, but lying directly to us, not once but twice, is unprofessional. Just because we are foreigners does not mean we dont understand Japanese. Greatly disappointed with the service and this whole dishonesty and lack of remorse spoilt our meal experience.

Visited this place on 1 July 2023, receipt time was 1354. Great atmosphere. Sleek and not crowded.  Good quality food with very nice flavors. Will definitely go back.  Quick service, friendly staff.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

The use of real vanilla beans in their cream speaks volumes about their commitment to excellence. The owner was incredibly welcoming and even assisted me in arranging my desserts for some stunning photos. I highly recommend this spot to anyone seeking topnotch desserts.

It's only a salad buffet usual lettuce leaves, peppers, cherry tomatoes,  various dressings and toppings croutons etc and also a couple of ""salads"" such as grated carrots with sultanas and a vinegar based dressing and a broccoli based salad also came with basic drinks water, orange juice, teas and coffee. Would be nice to have bread you got a couple of small rolls with your meal, but nothing else or something with potatoes or even rice as an option with the buffet. If you want fried potatoes or rice you have to pay extra and they're not cheap for the size of portion you get.
Giant meat ball was a bit bland and needed seasoning eating it with the heavily salted fries actually ended up helping it taste better. It was basically the usual Hamburg steak you get in Japan just round instead of flatter and oval.  Schnitzel was ok although some of the pork was a little fatty.
Think 2000yen was a little expensive for what you get, but not completely unreasonable  definitely ok if you eat a lot of salad!
Staff were very polite and the young man who served me even used a little bit of English which was unexpected and kind.
They are kid friendly  saw lots of kids and they also have a few high chairs. We were waiting outside for about 30mnt before we can get a seat no reservation for weekend. The staff told me that i only hv 90mnt in there. Ordered crepes and chips for 3 of us. It looks spacious in google map photos but when i came there, it not that spacious. Coffee and dessert is ok ok.. great view.
Not so sweet dessert, but toi may found it tasteless for something like pancake. Had a long wait to get in Saturday lunch place very popular with young mum's and babies very airy with outside seating. Buffet had salad, soups and some nice breads ... Staff were friendly and tried their best to communicate.... Recommend This place is combined with a cafe and furniture interior shop.

I left my laptop power cable on Friday night and they carefully looked after it until I came back the next day. I had the cafe mocha and New York cheesecake set which was very nice. Then the toast set with honey and butter the next morning with the ice cocoa, which was also very good. I also tried the lemon squash, which was pretty nice too. Both times I visited there were plenty of people but it wasn't crowded, and there was a movie playing silently on a tv screen with Japanese subtitles, and western music. All in all, a great vibe, and a great place to workstudygo with friends. Great place to have an oat milk matcha ask for otsumiruku henko. Bit pricey for the large mug, but they give you an actual bowl of matcha. The coffee is delicious and fresh. On a hot day the vanilla latte is amazing for a sweet and caffeine hit. Absolutely love this place. We've been looking for a good breakfast spot with coffee with milk substitutes which is surprisingly difficult to find in Japan and the oatmilk latte I got here was fabulous! The lady who helped us understood english really well too. We'll be back! Nice small coffee shop with English menu and English music.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Plus note they do have usage fee charged by the hour. So dont come here just for breakfast, this is more of a coworking space. They do not speak English or have any English written anywhere, I went knowing exactly how everything works after reading the reviews but she was still insisting on explaining it so we had to use Google or we would be stuck there, the system is very simple, you pay per hour to use a cubicle and pay for the time before leaving, any consumption is paid in advance when you order, that is it, but with no Japanese you will not get in without Google translate as they want to make sure that you understand that being there costs money, It would be so much easier with a simple text written in English that they can hand to foreigners so you could just agree with the prices and move on. Still very friendly and they are helpful despite the language limitation, she was happy to use my phone and write everything It's great that you can rent it by the hour!
It's perfect for when you have an impromptu zoom meeting and need WiFi and an outlet, or the nearby cafe is full and you can't get in!

The maximum daily amount is also fixed, so you can stay forever! You can also bring in items you bought nearby!

I think I will continue to use it a lot! Located in the Dojima underground shopping center, it is convenient and ideal for work.
If there is a meeting nearby, you can go a little early to check and revise your presentation materials.
You can also reserve a private room with a door for remote access, which is very convenient. I used it for the first time on a weekday afternoon.
The interior of the store is bright, simple, clean, and stylish.
A female staff member will carefully explain the system etc.
Selfstyle drinks available
Special coffee, tea, scones, toast, etc. are also available for an additional fee.
You can find a seat that suits you and concentrate on your work.
People who were using computers, remote, meetings, studying, and those who were allowed to bring their own meals were spending their time in their own style.
It's very comfortable and you can concentrate on studying.
A well thought out and thankful shop
The coffee recommended by the staff was delicious, so I'll try the toast and scones next time.
It seems like there are several stores, so I'd like to use them again when I'm on the move.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 9:00 PM

We got to sit outside by the river, but had to go inside to flag down the staff a few times to order since they couldnt see us and had no way to notify them bellQR code otherwise. Overall would def go again though just for the vibes! The place itself nice, but the sandwiches are not OK sadly. The chicken didnt seem well cooked through and all the ingredients are offbalance. Bread was bit soaked.

Maybe the rice dishes are nicer.  only time in japan that a waitress sat us, brought us a menu, took our order and brought the food usually one of those things is done on your own in japanese eateries. fantastic view and the prices are the most affordable of all the spots on the river. salad was ok but the chicken that came with it was excellent. helpful staff, clean, hip, relaxing. highly recommended. Went in for lunch once. The food quality is good and compared to chain stores I think it's fresh. The orders can take some time to prepare but it's a reasonable waiting time.

Seating is available indoors and out by the riverside. Indoor seating itself feels quite spacious, but you can may prefer outdoor seating if the weather is nice.

They serve their food in a cardboard box that I think they actively recycle, so don't toss it in the trash with all the other trash when you finish! Not a planned visit but surprisingly a great experience. Not much talked about the place but surely worth trying the food and drinks.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

We were only allowed to order drinks since we didn't have a reservation. The drinks are 110... drinks from family martlawson711 are way better. They charged 900 yen for a glass of iced tea. I went for the Frozen collaboration. I ordered frozen yogurt, but it was 80 ice and was hardly a drink.
There is almost no taste. The image is of the ice taken out. 1490 yen is a ripoff for this  Anyway, the inside of the store is full of cute aliens.
I made a reservation online in advance.

Order drinks and food using a pad set on the seating table.
There were a lot of goodies and it was fun. As mentioned in many other comments. Although it's a concept cafe, it's cheap.
I was surprised that neither the drinks nor the parfait were delicious.
There's a reason it's empty even though it's Saturday. It's a terrible store. I can't believe that Keema Curry, everyone's choice, was sold out so quickly even at lunchtime. Couldn't it have been predicted even with the reservation system because it was New Year's? I will never come again. I definitely do not recommend it to others.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Well, we ended up not taking another bite and it left a bad taste in our mouth, no pun intended. nope, the chef should have offered to remake it. not everyones taste is the same and i guess voicing your displeasure in Japan in frown upon. hopefully this was a branch specific experience. rest assured we are not coming back to this particular one at Daimaru Osaka. Be ready to down a lot of H2O with your meal. the long time waited for a table during holidays lunchtime.. so nice food and desert. the staff was very kindly. The cakes are a bit pricey, but the serving is quite large and very tasty. English menu is available via QR Scan.

If you like light texture cake and fluffy cream, Harbs is your place. It has all the trademarks of a good Japanses style cake. The fruits in the cake are also of high quality. Royal milk tea is also tasty.

There is usually a bit of a queue not too long. Chain desert restaurant, specializing in creamy cakes, such as Mille crepe layered with various fruits, chocolate cake, cheesecake, strawberry cake, etc.  They are all wonderfully delicious, light tasting and fresh.  Pastas are also pretty good.  A bit noisy with all the yelling by the servers Japanese culture?.  Service staff friendliness varies. The shops in japan are very fancy, just like this cake shop. We ordered two cakes from the menu because thats Kens birthday.

Harbour fresh fruits cake  There are so many layers inside  by using different kinds of seasonal fruits. Even though I dont like the taste of the cream but its definitely make from premium local milk products. One thing I feel so amazed of the cake , thats Even there are so many layers of the fruits and cake and creams , its stable as Taishan... and never fall down.  Its a large piece of cake , Shd have shared with someone. Its a bit pricy, but just go and have a try.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Cheese Tart Pablo Shinsaibashi,"Japan, 〒542-0085 Osaka, Chuo Ward, Shinsaibashisuji, 2-chōme−8−１ 心斎橋ゼロワンビル1F",4.1,34.671871,135.501195,"Ordered the ice cream with the original cheese tart set.
The original cheese tart is great.
Its soft and with strong cheese taste.
The base is the biscuit cookie type.
The ice cream is quite normal.
Compare with the ice cream, the cheese tart is a little more sweet.
Worth getting if no queue.
Staff is friendly. Will take care of the queue too. I had these cheese tarts for the first time in Canada, i knew it was from Japan but i wasn't exactly sure from where.
so eventually when i knew it was from here i got super excited to try it!
we took many flavors but the one we liked the most was with speculoos! highly recommended.
 i would like to say that the one I've had with Canada was better tho. Despite the long line, the wait was definitely worth it. The crme brle cheesecake was a standout, with its rich and creamy texture, perfectly caramelized top, and indulgent flavor. It was easily the highlight of the visit. I also tried the original and strawberry flavors, both of which were delightful, smooth, and satisfying. The original had a classic richness, while the strawberry added a fresh, fruity twist that complemented the creamy base. However, the matcha flavor was less creamy compared to the others, and while it had a distinct flavor, it didnt quite reach the same level of indulgence as the other varieties. That being said, the overall experience was fantastic, and I would happily wait in line again for another taste of the crme brle. Each flavor offered something unique, but if you're visiting Pablos, Id highly recommend trying the crme brle or the original. The balance of sweetness and texture in those flavors is truly exceptional. While the matcha might appeal to those who enjoy a less creamy texture and a bold flavor, it didnt quite meet the high bar set by the other options. Nonetheless, Pablos is a mustvisit spot in Osaka for cheesecake lovers, and I left feeling completely satisfied with the experience. Cheese tarts are super tasty. Theres a hint of salt. Not too sweet at all. We liked both original and crme brle. Queue moves up quickly, dont be discouraged. Worth it!! Visited the store a week ago. Queue may look long, but it clears pretty fast. Waited 5 mins before its my turn to order. The cheese tart is great! Nice and chewy. Would definitely try the creme brle version next time! Pricewise, its okay.","Monday: 10:30 AM – 9:00 PM

I dont know if its the particular tart I picked or the store in general, but its definitely not as good as I remembered. The crust is still great texture wise, but the fruit and filling was a bit tasteless. Best Cake shop so far. They have in season fruit tart which are very delicious. Expect long queue but well worth the waiting. Highly recommended. Try in season fruit. Winter limited is Luxury White Strawberry Tart The fig really tasted fresh and i really like pie crust. It crumbly and soft, the balance of tartness of the fruit and sweetness of the crust was perfect. It was a bit pricy though. Their coffee was good too. The place is a bit cramped and the line is always long. Minimum waiting time could be 20mins and i think it could go up in an hour during weekends. I wish they could to a bigger place since it's very popular. They also had a wide selection of fruit tarts and other souvenir treats. One of the best cake I ever had in my travels.

Their egg tarts were a delightful surprise! With a flaky crust and a creamy, custard center, they rivaled the best Pasteis de Nata I've tasted. A musttry for any sweet tooth visiting Osaka. Little shop that sells tarts and a couple of other small pastries.

Depending what the people in front of you are getting, the line can move very quickly or very slowly.

I just got an egg tart, and it was great. It's a bit greasy and difficult to eat while just standing around the busy street. If you can wait, I recommend taking it home to eat.

As you can see, I couldn't wait, and I took a bite before remembering to take a picture sorry about that. Prices for tarts are fair, other items such as the apple pie seemed a bit absurd. Service was great. Way better than Pablos in my opinion  the crust is flaky and perfectly baked compared to a premade base. The filling is gooey and creamy. Overall not too sweet for the original egg tart which is what I love in a dessert. Had one on my first day in saka, couldnt stop thinking about them so Im back on my last day and bought a box of 4  yes, theyre that good  FEB 2024

Bought three different egg tarts to try. The chocolate flavor was rich and decadent with some fresh cream on top to balance the sweetness. Matcha red bean was mildly sweet with a decent matcha strength which is not overpowered by the red bean taste. Both were pretty tasty but the original egg tart is still my favorite simple yet delicious with the perfect pairing of the flaky and slightly buttery tart crust with the sweet, mildly eggy and creamy custard. Absolutely amazing!! One of the best egg tarts place in Osaka, my opinion. Their egg tarts are nice and crispy on the outside, fluffy and deliciously flavorful on the inside. We got 4 flavors, chocolate, caramel, matcha, and regular. They were all delicious. My favorite is the chocolate. Highly recommend this place to get egg tarts.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM

We really enjoyed both, just the perfect amount too. No place to sit down inside the store so we ate them standing outside. Only then we realized that there is a park across the street with benches, I'd recommend to enjoy your delicious desserts and some quiet time in the park. I stayed in Hommachi for a holiday in Osaka and tried all the flavours over four days.
It's delicious 
The jelly in the fruit and coffee flavours is very refreshing.
The matcha and pistachio flavours are both flavourful.
The regular nameraka pudding is my favourite.
I recommend trying at least the nameraka pudding and another flavour. Since the reviews were good, I thought I'd like to try it at least once, so I bought Nameraka Pudding and Retro. The smooth pudding was so soft that it fell apart and tasted like eating custard. Retro pudding was a harder pudding and I preferred the texture of Retro. It was an excellent pudding!
I bought this as a White Day present for my wife.
I was looking for takeout pudding in Osaka for my wife who loves pudding, and I found this one.
This shop is famous for its melty pudding, but they also have a wide variety of seasonal puddings and puddings of various flavors.
When I was unsure about what to buy, the store staff carefully explained what features it had.
I bought Retro Pudding'' and seasonal pudding Sakura Pudding'' for my wife who likes hard pudding.
Actually, I wanted to eat them all, but I'm going to hold back this time and go buy them again. Prusik is a cute shop right in front of Utsubo Park.
A chiffon cake and pudding shop.

The store is a takeout specialty store.

Fruits that are in season now
The showcase was gorgeous, with bottled fruit jellies of peach, shine muscat, cantaloupe, and mango.

Everything looks delicious, including today's recommendation 3 and the pudding introduced in Matsuko's Unknown World!

I'm confused and it will end soon.
Bottle Jelly Shine Muscat

Bottle jelly cantaloupe
Muskmelon is from Shizuoka Prefecture

Juicy jelly with plenty of fruits

Vanilla beans are from Madagascar
This pudding has a very nice texture and aroma.

Cheese pudding

Rich but refreshing pudding with pudding and cheese
Perfect with the sweet and sour berry sauce

Shine muscat, cantaloupe, and peach are almost out of stock, but new products such as marron and sweet potato will be released following pumpkin, so I'm looking forward to those as well!

Hong Kong s branch really cant compare with  Food 45 Apple pieturnover with custard filling
Service 45 Good service
Value 35 A bit pricey for what you get
Ambiance 45 Food is to go, confectionery visible from outside

Ringo means apple in Japanese, the store specializes in miniature apple pieturnovers with a custard filling that varies by season.  In addition to regular custard I have seen chocolate as well as chestnut flavored custard offered in the past.

The pieturnover itself is yummy, sadly it i not that big, and the price is a bit up there for how relatively easy it is to make the pieturnover.  Best value is to get a set of 4 and share with family and friends.

There used to be long lines about 3 years ago when the store opened, these days there might be 35 people lined up to purchase at the store.

Worth trying at least once to experience the flavor of the apple pieturnover with custard. So delicious! We came back after 4 years and it is just as good as we remembered  Judging from the line of people waiting, these are very popular pastries. I picked up a couple of the basic custard cream apple pies and I was pretty disappointed. They were so overpoweringly sweet that I could barely taste the custard or the apple. 1st try and test amazing! Will try again if possible during the trip!","Monday: 10:30 AM – 8:30 PM

So when we walked past this place in the late afternoon, we decided to try it out since there was no queue at all.

We bought the Cheese Coin and the Custard Coin. We can't compare them with other vendors', but we thought they were delicious.

I'd like to think that they were made to order and we really waited a long time for the server to make them and with lovecare. That's why they tasted great. LOL Cheese coin pastry here is tastier than by the river and touristy stands. You can actually get a decent cheese pull, pastry is a tad dense but crispy and not too sweet. Overall one of the better cheese coin pastry. This may have been a promotion while I was there September 2019 but I bought a cheese dog from this place.
Hot dog and mozzarella cheese deep fried, rolled in sugar, then topped with ketchup and honey mustard.
An abomination  yet so delicious. I ate it like a complete animal sitting in the street. 5 stars.

If they have this promotion when you visit GET IT.
Also, I wish I would of bought the beautiful ice cream. It was my intention. Yet the cheese dog seduced me, I couldnt resist. Cute little ice cream shop. The interior design of the shop is unique. I only bought snack, the taste is yummy compare to dontonbori area cheese coin pancake","Monday: 1:00 – 7:00 PM

They provide lots of flavors of chocolates that theyre quite special. Like black current, champagne, honey, pistachio, citrus and so on. They do explain what chocolate when they serve. If therere name tags on them will be very appreciated. Because theyre too many kinds. The price is relatively high, but its worthy in my opinion. The takeout chocolate are also good for special day like Valentine. Excellent chocolate desert restaurant. Nice cakes and very nice settings. Expensive. The queue is lonng waiting at least 1.5 hours.

It's not fair to say it is the best canele in Osaka, i would rate it above average. Crispy outside bit it's sticky inside. I taste it more than 30 minutes after purchase.

 Atmosphere
It looks so good from it's appearance and interior design

 Service
Wonderful and extraordinary service with patience. Very friendly employees and delicious pastries! We got one of each and they were all fantastic. My favorite was the apricot and the lemon. I could eat these every day The top of the top Mini Canele de Bordeaux.
After many years followed in Instagram, i finally got a chance to visit this tiny shop in Osaka.

Its worth to visit if you staying in Osaka if you love traditional Canele .

All the flavour of the canele were outstanding.
Perfect recipe and temperature control.
Crunchy outside but moist inside. Super tiny shop only afford to stand max 2 customers I guess, only take away available. Tastes average, not my kind of canele. Price at the high side. Suprisingly reasonable pricing, especially considering how much work goes into these! The set we bought came with an English menu. The busier flavors sounded good on paper but kinda fell flat. My favorites were the coffee and walnut. Those two had the best textures and the most assertive tastes, IMO. My friend's favorites were the plain and the rum raisin. If I were to go here again, I'd probably get a box with one coffee, one walnut, maaaybe one anzu or houjicha, and fill the rest of the space with plain.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

I'm coming back soon to try some carrot cake. Lots of vegan options and a cute little upstairs dining area. Love it!  Unreal vegan bakery in Osaka! We tried the strawberry cake, strawberry donut  chocolate chip cookie and they were all delicious. Everything is freshly baked and the cream used is so good! The prices are reasonable too, a must visit for vegans and nonvegans alike. Amazing vegan donuts! The designs are really cute and theres a variety of flavors. Savory pizza looking donut was perfect! Lemon, blueberry and matcha are great.
The founder and the staff speak English, the place is busy and genki. Definitely going to get my birthday cake there! Thank you for opening this place. It helps animals and people. We had the Victoria sponge cake and the chocolate cupcake, both of which were glutenfree and delicious, especially the Victoria sponge. The sponge was slightly dense which I loved. My girlfriend isn't a fan of chocolate bakes, and has now been converted by the cupcake. We also had coffee which was skillfully prepared.

All of the cakes are vegan, too.

The caf is small and cute. It also has seating upstairs which was a pleasant surprise. Even if there's no space in the caf, there's a park across the street where you could sit and enjoy the goodies.

The staff were very polite and helpful.

The only downside was that there's no toilet.

Overall, we were very satisfied and would gladly return. Absolutely amazing donuts!
There wasn't any space when we went 6 seats only, so we got them to go. Absolutely delicious, fried I think!. Really fluffy, not overly sweet and very good value.

Definitely recommend, vegan or not.

Coffee was okay  quite fruity, went nicely with the donut.

Price  around 3500 so about 1.703 at the time of this and exchange rate. You absolutely wouldn't get this quality at this price in London.","Monday: Closed

Right by the riverchannel. If you're looking for a very good bingsu I can only recommend this place ! The atmosphere is really nice, it feels like being in korea.

 Beeessssttttt dessert of the trip! Nothing beats traditional desserts like this! Amato Maeda is a cute little shop located in the underground Namba Walk.

 Love a fresh skewer of warm chewy dango. It was really hard to choose what to order but I did not regret what I ordered at all! Warm dango with cold softserve, brown sugar jelly, rice crackers, and red bean. Ahhh if only I can have some right now I had the Match  Icecream Kakigori. It was really good!

The Yuzu Soda was absolutely fantastic.

Service was OK. Took a couple extra ""sumimasen"" to get the staff's attention for ordering. We were strolling around the underground Namba Walk area and this mochimacha dessert spot caught our eyes.

We ordered two different types of desserts and both are really good.

Good place to get your legs rested and try out some dessert before burning the calories off with more walking in the Namba area. Delicious traditional sweets shop located in a subway station. Staff was polite and kind, and the sweets were definitely something worth coming back for. Highly recommend the cream anmitsu and the black sugar warabi mochi with ice cream. Really good Japanese sweets shop. Loved everything we got here, including the zenzai, dango, and mochi. Could be too sweet for some though.

The ugly just didnt fit our taste buds! Saw this place on YouTube and had to try it!  It did not disappoint.its Halal ice cream so no sugar added but you wouldnt be able to taste the difference! This is a quaint place with vegan options. I would say that the service is really good. The staff helped a deaf guy very patiently and tried to use English with me. I got a pistachio baklava while I thought was small was very tasty. I find the English music in the background though a little off touch with the vibes the interior creates. Lovely cafe within Osaka station serving yummy vegan meals and desserts.

I ordered 2 flavors  dates cacao and fig  really delicious. You can taste they use fresh ingredients to make the ice cream.

Will come back and order other flavors  Hanamitsu Milk gelato is a musttry! Its honey and milk but yet so delicious and not overly sweet. I even went to buy seconds. Wild Berries gelato was light and refreshing. Almond gelato was thick and heavy.

You can choose to have your gelato with nuts and cornflakes for free! Two scoops of gelato for 660 yen is quite affordable. The staff are friendly and speak English. You can also sample the ice cream.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Upon arrival we were escorted to 2F where the ""Salon du chocolat"" is located.

Heres what we ordered and our thoughts

Drinks
 Hot Ghana Chocolate, no sugar added
 Hot Kyoto Matcha White Chocolate

Cakes
   rectangular
  cubeshaped

If you order one cake  drink, it becomes a set, with discounted price at JP100 per drink.

For all our order, we paid JP 2,772.

We highly recommend trying the cubeshaped cake, . It was a delightful experience, especially with the nutty cracker on top. The taste profile was incredibly dynamic, evolving with each bite and chew. Initially, it was buttery, then transformed into a nutty flavor with mild bitterness reminiscent of cacao nibs, but very fine. It concluded with a surprising fruity note.

Every bite and sip was worth it! Make sure to finish your drinks to the very bottom, as the tasty sediments there are not to be missed.

We had very good time! Enjoy your visit to Cacaotier Gokan! Upstairs cafe for drinking chocolate, choose from no sugar added nutty Vietnam, fruity Ghana, or smoky Trinidad Tobago, and a second menu of snack items. Downstairs is separate for 70 dark bean to bar chocolate bars, among other confections. I have tried Cacaotier Gokan for the first time in Sapporo and I have immediately regretted we havent purchased more, absolutely the best dark chocolate cacao sand I have ever tried! The staff are helpful and shop is great too. I am an expert in Chocolates and was looking forward to try the 70 Bean to Bar Dark chocolate.

Sadly it tastes exactly like Lindt cant taste a difference  but Lindt is at least 3 or 4 times cheaper for 50g and can be be bought everywhere. Beautiful delicious chocolate cakes.

While the texture lived up to its milky name, it may not be for everyone, especially if you prefer lighter flavors. Unfortunately, the strawberries didnt taste as fresh as Id hoped, which left the overall experience a bit underwhelming. The exterior of the shop is quite eyecatching and tends to draw a crowd, so expect a bit of a queue. They also offer a variety of other strawberrythemed sweets, which might be worth exploring if youre a fan of the fruit. strawberry soft serve 650 was really good, so creamy and milky, it tasted more like ice cream than actual soft serve. strawberry daifuku 500 was quite sweet, and the strawberries werent sweet, like what others said they didnt taste fresh. ill give the ice cream 5 stars while the daifuku 2, averaging to 4 as the ice cream was too good! strawberry flavour is more towards the sour side while the milk was sweet which balanced out the flavour really well. it melts really quickly though The mochi was delicious, but the filling was not. I got the bean one which I wasnt a fan of.

The texture is soft and very flexible. Strawberry was fresh, and tasty. The one my partner had was peach and strawberry and would recommend. The ice cream was incredibly deliciousdefinitely worth the wait. Theres usually a line, but the rich strawberry flavors make it totally worthwhile. Oh my goodness! Daikufu mochi  we had both, strawberry and matcha ones. 1010! Especially the strawberry ones, the red bean filling is perfect, not too red bean which kids love. The daifuku is soft and perfect texture.

Has the strawberry crepe too! Yummy!

I tried the original, chocolate, and strawberry. My favorite was a strawberry one. It didn't sour, but yet tasted so fresh. Simply delicious. Had the pumpkin spice waffle seasonal, it was nice and hot, and the custard filled waffle. No, there are no toppings on these, but they don't need them. They are very sweet and flavorful on their own. Nice to just grab and go for a sweet treat. Every time we pass through in front of this store, we always smell the freshly made waffle. One day we finally decided to buy it, and it tasted as good as it smelled. And also, the price is very affordable!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Namba Dotonbori Desert Waffle SUIPARA,"Japan, 〒542-0077 Osaka, Chuo Ward, Dōtonbori, 1-chōme−10−７, Weed21, B1",4.3,34.6689198,135.5005943,"For people who like to eat chestnuts  You can try this menu for 1300 yen. Taste is good. The location is under the bridge. Amazing food, 5 stars. Super delicious! I went to a waffle sweets shop located just down the river from Dotonbori Bridge.

It seems like they only specialize in takeout.
There are some chairs in front of the store.
You can also eat there.

Various fruits and plenty of fresh cream
I ordered a sweet wrapped in a waffle.

I heard that they also had delicatessen items such as egg salad, but I thought they only had sweets items.

Two of us went there and received .

Plenty of strawberries cut into easytoeat pieces and fresh cream that isn't too sweet.

The waffle dough was fluffy and had a bit of a castellalike feel to it.

The corn flakes had a nice crunchy texture and although it was quite large, I was able to eat it till the end without getting bored. SUIPARA'' is a waffle specialty store located at Dotonbori River Walk, 2 minutes walk from Osaka Metro Namba Station, diagonally below the Glico signboard.
You can enjoy bubble waffles, which are popular overseas and have a pinky, fairytale look and are arranged in a crepe style.

Bubble waffles are round, chewy eggbased waffles that resemble baby castella and are inspired by a Hong Kong sweet called chicken egg.
After ordering, the waffles are baked,
Cornflakes and fresh cream inside
Layered with strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, topped with strawberry Pocky and sauce.
Fullbodied fresh cream
The fresh cream is light and full of sweetness. Very satisfying for fresh cream lovers. The waffles are just the right thickness, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

The waffles come in regular size and half size, and come with a variety of toppings.
You can attach colored ribbons to any size, and the original visuals will enhance the fun of taking photos.

Although it is a takeout specialty store, there are benches outside where you can sit.
With summer in full swing, it's a good idea to stroll along the Dotonbori River while eating Dotonbori waffles.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

The ice cream is quality and the flavors are deep. The pistachio might be the best Ive ever had and the earl grey chocolate is fantastic. Original flavour and nice people inside. I took earl grey chocolate  hazelnut and it was very tasty. Good experience at a homey store, service and atmosphere was great and definitely ideal for a date. Earl grey chocolate could use more Earl grey since the chocolate flavor was overpowering but otherwise no complaints! Lovely ice cream shop!

Had 2 scoops earl grey chocolate and hazelnut. Hazelnut was fantastic but earl grey chocolate mainly just tasted like chocolate.

Service and atmosphere was impeccable, staff were extremely nice and atmosphere was nice and cozy. Great date spot overall! Super fresh and delicious ice cream! The texture is amazing, and make sure to try the pistachio flavor!!","Monday: 12:00 – 6:00 PM

I am recommending to order the take away sweet crepes only. I followed the reviews on Google maps and didn't disappoint. The restaurant is just a little bit off the main path but it's surprising to see there is almost no foreigners here. There is a slow flow of Japanese customers always stopping by for a crepe or two and that gives us confidence that the place would be nice.

There is a menu on a board in front of the shop with an English version right at the counter. Our order was done quickly and it tasted delicious. A dainty place with three floors of seating though that is still not enough for each floor only have 6 tables of 2. Oh yes the 1st floor is only for takeaways.
By the way, they do not allow sharing and ask you place one order each if dining in.
We had a set that came with soup, drink, galette and crepe. Sort of a savory and sweet mix.
The ala carte galette of chicken with cream cheese was so good.
A happy place to be on a saturday. Nice crepes with very aromatic house tea Alcyon Bleue. Note The cafe has 1 person 1 order rule. Dropped in for a couple of crepes today. We dined in. Overall the experience was average. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice but the crepes are nothing special. I saw many reviews saying these are the best crepes ever. They really are not. We had two of the most popular ones and were not wowed by them. On the plus side, it is very cheap.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 9:00 PM

At first glance, you might not realize it has seating, as all the chairs and tables are upstairs with only the bakery counter visible downstairs. Intrigued by a sign advertising unique fruit teas, we decided to venture inside. Once there, we discovered a cozy seating area upstairs where we could enjoy various pastries along with our coffee and tea. Fresh from a nail appointment, my friend and I found this cafe to be the perfect spot to conclude our afternoon. The atmosphere was relaxing, the service attentive, and the pastries and teas delicious! Afternoon tea set was delicious, everything is seasonal. Accidentally ordered for one instead of two but there was enough food for a light afternoon meal for two to split. Their custom teas are heavenly and sold separately downstairs. The best part was the Earl grey meringue and their alcyon blue tea. Small restaurant is upstairs, not wheelchair accessible. Seats 18 people max. Pastry shop is downstairs. No English speakers We stopped at the Salon ""de the"" Alcyone for dessert while visiting Osaka. The decor is quite French themed and looks like a place you'd want to try for a first date. We ordered a parfait and fruit pavlova. They were really good! Seating is on the second floor and the first floor has many cookies, cakes, teas, etc. for sale to take with you. Were in patisserie heaven!!! I had the seasonal Hotacha Montblanc  their local version of Mont Blanc made with local chestnuts. Refer to the pics below. I hope I did justice. It really was exceptional.
Tucked in a quiet corner just a short walk from the busy main Dotonbori artery, its a fantastic respite from the bustling thoroughfare. Highly recommended! A great little cafe above a pastry shop.
Been there 3 times in the last 3 years, they have seasonal special which are something that must try.
Good spot to have a chat and enjoy some fruity teas.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 8:00 PM

Their parfaits are exquisite and unique. I had to come twice so good it was, and the price is very reasonable 1516 usd for such a high level of preparation. My favorite was Banana  Chocolate and second best was limited edition  the Marigold. They have tables and bar seating options. The crowd and service was very nice. Open late. On Sunday night around 10pm we had to wait for 57 min to get a table. They specialise in parfaits. Each parfait is uniquely design and crafted. If Im not mistaken, the menu changes each season with the parfaits highlighting the ingredients that are in season. A queue start even before the cafe opens, so do go early! All of the parfaits contain alcohol but there's only a tiny little hint of it which enriches the flavor.  The coffee was unexpectedly tasteful and aromatic.  It goes along perfectly with the parfaits. The parfait was amazing!!!

A lot of negative reviews but honestly our experience was positive. Paid money, kids got an ice cream and a laugh with the usual great silliness of a Turkish ice cream. Happy kids, not much to complain about. As I can see, many Turkish ice cream places were very happy to let people record photo or video of them, because it helped to advertise their business. But not this place! After i took a photo from a distance but not buying his ice cream, he said a lot of bla bla i think bad words to my face while there were some other foreigners took photos as well, i think he targeted on Asian women because we are weak and not really fight back. I was just landed in Japan so of course there are things that i was still not clear or forgot, if you are not happy of what i did, as a business owner, you should behave more civilized. This is the ONLY bad experience i had in Japan in my trip 2 years ago.

Butter sandwich
It has a very buttery flavor and has two layers of buttercream and butter caramel inside.
The cookies outside were crispy and delicious.

Is there a repeat? none? 
It was a dish that could be an option when you want to eat a butter sandwich 

Thank you for the meal uA You can eat freshly baked food
Since I don't have one nearby, I can only buy it online.
Whenever I come to Osaka, I always
I will buy many for myself .
You can purchase from 1 piece.
Crunchy cookies are fragrant
Mixed with the melty contents
The best! I didn't know you could buy freshly baked butter sandwiches. What's more, I'm happy to be able to buy just one item.

I was hesitant but bought the plain one.

It was delicious, crispy on the outside and melty on the inside.

The bread was super soft and fluffy. It paired well he the green tea ice cream I had.
Lines can be slightly long but service is quick. Warm melon bread with good ice cream shoved in the middle. What can I say, it was amazing and one of my favorite desserts I have had in Japan.

It's a small little stand on the main drag. That makes it incredibly popular and something you need to walk around a find a spot you can eat it at, as there's so many people in this area. If you love melon pan, stop here while youre in Dotonbori. They have fresh melon pan, with smooth ice cream in the middle. We still think back to how good it would be to have one every now and then. You know its a good spot when you think that way! Reasonable prices too! Was good! We chose the one with the matcha tea. There is also vanilla and strawberry flavors! We had to wait for 10 mins or do but the line goes pretty fast. Overall was a nice dessert and I would have it again! Delicious!!

I went there before 9 p.m., and I was lucky to get a gelato the staff was in a hurry to close the shop . So, at 845 pm, it was the last order, and 10 people couldn't get it. I felt that they could have served them in a few minutes... 10000 Don't you need money? Lol. If you're looking for highquality gelato, I suggest trying somewhere else. Superbly delicious gelato, delicate flavors and not overly sweet. I tried the Gorgonzola. It had a mild but distinct Gorgonzola flavor Its located right on the basement a little hard to fine but you have to listen to that water fountain and thats where the store is. The flavor of the ice cream was just OK. The branding on this store triggers me. First of all, why bar? Because you serve coffee?
And your subtitle? They are ristorante made gelato. We made them in the same way as cuisine?

You used a word generator to create this dum text? Or hired a child to do your work?

Enough about branding. Ice was decent, Mediocre, but small portions and pricey. The gelato here is nice and the have an outdoor seating area right next to a fountain which is really peaceful.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

To our surprise, inside there was a sweet potato filling instead. Taste is fair, yet I was craving for a juicy baked apple with cinnamon to be honest. Ive never had a sweet potato apple pie before so thats what I got. Cant say Im a huge fan of the combination because it feels heavier in the stomachthe pie is so dense. The texture is different too. Wonderful test Post only gourmet food you want to repeat 

Sweet potato 650 yen
Takeout


My favorite store for a long time! ! 
My dad used to buy this for his sweet potato loving daughters 

I went for the chestnut tart this time, but I knew the sweet potato was delicious too, so I bought it! ! !

Chestnut tart is available for a limited time only
I really liked the rich flavor of Shibukawa chestnuts! ! !
The sweetness is modest and it's really rich! All I can say is...! 
There are a lot of chestnuts on top, and there's even gold leaf on it, giving it a luxurious feel... This cake is made with ripe roasted sweet potatoes and is irresistible for sweet potato and chestnut lovers

I have never met a sweet potato that is better than this one! ! !
It has two layers, and the bottom is just the roasted sweet potato itself! The whole skin is attached! The skin of a roasted sweet potato is also delicious, and it's great to be able to eat it as is! 
The top is a sweet potato with a sticky and warm baked potato flavor! This combination is the best! ! The best part is that they use roasted sweet potatoes as they are! ! 

I don't have a chance to go to Osaka Station anymore, so I'm sad that I don't have many opportunities to buy them
I will definitely buy it again if I have the chance! By the way, Daigakuimo is also delicious in the past! ! ! ! JYP702 tax included Sweet Potato Custard Tart
Pass by the sweet potato dessert shop on your way to Yaban Shrine
Sweet potatoes with skin are super sweet  there is a thin candied pound cake sandwiched with pudding custard like the pudding custard sold by Taiwanese family  there is a layer of syrup on the top
The sweet potatoes are sweet and delicious, very big
The entrance is cold

Dessert Place Shikisai,"3-chōme-6-2 Tanaka, Minato Ward, Osaka, 552-0005, Japan",4.7,34.6606074,135.4446862,"I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that it is Minato Ward's representative sweets store.
It is famous for having received numerous interviews.
And not only famous,
You can enjoy it in a unique way, and
It's a good restaurant with delicious food.
I wonder if there is a normal whole cake...
I've never seen it before, but
The whole cake here is
Break the sweet meringue into crisp pieces,
Eat it with whole cake cream on top.
This creates an indescribable sense of fun and deliciousness.
We also have a variety of baked goods,
I haven't bought it yet.
I want to eat it lol I've known about it for a while, but this time I went by car for the first time. It's a wide back road, so I parked a little in front of the store before entering. A variety of products are lined up in a stylish store with a black theme. Since I came all the way, I bought the most expensive item, Summer Night Matcha Tiramisu Ameya''. The outside is coated with chocolate, and the inside is cream, matcha, and citrus jelly, making it the perfect summer sweet, but at 1,188 yen, it's quite expensive. There are many products that are perfect as souvenirs, such as cheesecakes and roll cakes, so if you're interested, it's a good idea to stop by once. Apparently it's made by a famous pastry chef.
We ate cakes and sampled roll cakes.
To be honest, the roll cake might be the best deal in terms of price and value.
I wonder if there are other places where the cake really stood out.
Cash payment confirmation
PayPay payment confirmation
Maybe there are chairs outside?
Can I use a wheelchair? I had some business nearby and stopped by for the first time.
It's a cake shop tucked away in a quiet residential area, and it blends in with the surrounding houses, so if you're not conscious of it, you'll miss it.

Brightly colored and gorgeous cakes were displayed in the showcase, and baked goods were displayed in a chic and calm booth.
Light and shadow, brightness and darkness, black and white of exterior and interior, hardness and softness.
It's a stylish shop with a modern design and lots of colors.

I wanted to try it all, but I was worried about it.

Shortcake
Concentrated roll cake
Smoked cheesecake half

Choose from 3 types.
The shortcake comes in a transparent square container, and the strawberry slices are bright and glossy.
It was covered in powdered sugar and decorated with cute strawberries, and it was the first time I had ever seen a strawberry decoration where perishable strawberries were cut out.

I thought the transparent containers were well thought out, not only for their appearance, but also because they made it easy for the store staff to pack, they were easy to eat anywhere, and they could be reused.

It was a cake with plenty of cream and strawberries, with sweet and sour strawberries, fresh cream with a light and elegant taste, and a little bit of fluffy sponge.

Personally, I would have liked the cream to be a little richer, or have a lingering taste and aroma, but they also provide a spoon if you wish so that you can eat it immediately after purchase.
I think it would be easy to use as a souvenir or gift 

The concentrated roll cake has a strong and rich egg flavor, is fluffy, but also elastic, with a fine texture, a moist sponge, a smooth custard, and a concentrated raspberry filling, or rather a hard jam. Even though I don't like framboise, it had a nice flavor and was easy to eat.
I felt like the cream was a little off compared to the sponge and framboise, but it was a delicious roll cake

Smoked cheesecake is glutenfree, and as the name suggests, it's smoked with rosemary, so a sharp, rich smoky aroma passes through your nose, and the richness of the cheese is lightened, making it a refreshing cake. I think you will either like it or not, depending on your preference for smoked foods and cheese, but it's a mature taste that can be enjoyed as a snack with wine 

As for the price, due to the recent price hikes, I feel it's a little higher than the cake prices I'm used to, but if you register as a member free, you'll get a 10 discount on all items, so it's a good deal. .
There are also benefits such as being able to buy seasonal memberonly cakes, birthday benefits, and smoother preordering.

There is no parking lot, so if you are driving, we recommend that you park nearby or pull up to the park side on the road in front of the store and purchase quickly.
Apparently they are also sold online.

In addition to soba, I have recently become allergic to rice, and have recently started to suspect that I might also be allergic to wheat. Now that I'm starting to reduce my intake, I'm glad I had a cake with less wheat.
The clerk was also kind, polite, and friendly. As a chef who honed his skills as a restaurant pastry chef, there were a number of playful sweets lined up in the showcase, and I got excited and bought 5 fresh cakes and a zerogravity castella.
I was impressed not only by its bright appearance, but also by the excellent balance of texture and taste.
This is a shop that does a great job and is worth the trip.","Monday: Closed

I love the seasonal tastes changing every time I go ! Also love having a terrace, which can be hard to find in Japan Theyre so good i got lemon strawberry and raspberry my sister got mango and tropicale. The workers are nice and the place is pretty! We were looking for real good icecream in Osaka as opposed to those from soft serving machines.
FLOR did not disappoint in flavours however the size were quite small compared to Australian standards. Hence the price was high for what you get. We recommend FLOR and would come again.  after lunch we felt like having dessert and looked for several places where we could sit and enjoy an ice cream

until we had the great luck that Google map showed us this store

I had already tasted this ice cream in another country and I have no idea that it was in Japan

I ate half dark chocolate and fig mascarpone
it was great!

in addition to being open until 2100 there is also an ice cream  sparkling wine set

I recommend this store! Average ice cream  too creamy for my liking. Not really gelato as I know it. Sorbet was good through","Monday: Closed

They have the take out on the first floor, and the restaurant on the second floor. The restaurant is bigger than I expected. They offer various type of cakes.

I ordered 3 different types of cakes strawberry short cake, roll cake, green tea pudding. The strawberry cake was refreshing and not too sweet, the roll cake was soft and not dry at all, and the green tea pudding had a balance elements and toppings. I also ordered their matcha and ice coffee each person has to order one drink. In total, I spent 3,333.

Highly recommend to relax and have tea time while eating delicious cakes. A nice cozy place to have high tea.Although it was very busy, the service was quick and friendly. We were very impressed with the delicious flavors Amazing patisserie! The pastries on sale were both eye candy and delicious. Queuing to eat at the cafe on the second floor takes patience as the queue is long. Go to the front of the queue to get a number from the ticket machine and wait. But it is well worth it  This is a decent dessert store. Foreigner friendly, describe all the items properly. I went there for cake breakfast as I heard the high tea session will have long queue. Staff will show us a selection of cake display to choose from which is quite fancy, and I picked a black bean chestnut cake with organic coffee.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Very different from the classic NY cheese cake or the classic cheese cake from the Basque Country, the Japanese fluffy cheese cake will surprise you with their texture and flavor. It tastes more like egg and milk than cheese. It is not as sweet as the other classic cheese cakes. It is not served with anything else, which helps you eat more of it.

Fast line and the option to pay by card or with cash. Handy that they offer you the option to buy a plastic spoon, knife or fork. The best thing for the shop is started by how they separate the queue line. There is a line for just baked longer but quite fast and ready shorter.

The cheese is delicious and a must try while you are around the Namba area.

The also have a seating table in the second floor but need to reserve days before.

The less point is, the cake is best eaten while still hot, but it's only take away because the second floor is limited table and you need to find another place to eat. Fluffy jiggly Japanese cheesecake that melts in your mouth when you eat it fresh from the oven.  Theres always a queue but it moves quickly, and the baking is quite fast.  Best lightweight fluffy cheesecake we have tasted, and the raisins at the bottom give a flavourful touch.  So glad that we went looking for it!  We also managed to buy a second time on our day of departure, to bring home to family  Would be great if they have an outlet at the airport. Love how well they managed the queue! They separated the line based on Just Baked or Baked a few hours or so ago, so you get to choose the level of freshness. The staff was efficient so even though there was a considerable crowd, we got our cake in no time.

We got the fresh one and loved it! The cake was soft and had enough sweetness, but not too overbearing. But in terms of enjoyment, it was just okay because there was just one kind of taste throughout so you might get bored by the second slice. It was alright to try but wasn't my fave cheesecake. Awesome experience getting a got fresh japanese cheesecake right from the oven. Even though there is a line, it moves super fast, very efficient.  You can also get the cake that was made 2h before no line for that. It was great to see how they are being made also!
There is one shop at the airport as well where we headed right after, but this main  branch  was still worth the visit  Keep it up! Bravo!","Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Brle was oish  Reasonably priced and the ice cream you get is different to other places in the area. Make sure to check out the speciality ice creams for different occasions. The Halloween ice cream is a must. Opened late too which is a bonus They are opened till really late. Enjoyed the late night dessert! Delicious soft serve and toppings.

There were about 3 groups of customers queueing. We were being seated in about 10 minutes, it was the waiting of our food order that was quite long. Food was being served about 15  20 minutes after we were seated.

Ordered the Classic Happy Pancake and Pancake with Banana  Chocolate Sauce. The pancake is really spongy, soft and smooth. Impressive by the high quality of the pancake that it makes the wait worthwhile. Hands down the best pancake I've had so far! Wanted to try the original because that's what mostly people recommend but the hubs wanted chocolate and wow, IT WAS MINDBLOWING!

The dark choco and granola was a perfect blend. We requested the staff to split out the sauce , cream and topping so that we can taste the original pancake without anything on. Staff was very friendly and helpful too.

They have free water station too , with and without lemon.

Will definitely visit again! The half hour wait to get inside, was the maximum amount of time we were willing to spend waiting to enter a place  They seated us at the big table at the entrance next to other couples and families, and took our orders some happy pancakes, some pancakes with cheese mousse and berry sauce, and some shakes. The fluffiness of the pancakes is indeed delicious. The service was quick and friendly. You can also see the chefs preparing the pancakes in ""the kitchen"" behind glass panels. We really enjoyed it. Definitely worth the wait and hype The pancakes are so fluffy and delicious. You get a lot of toppings and whipcream on your pancakes so they are very filling !! The staff is very sweet and understands very good English. There will be a wait of 40 minutes and you need to get a ticket first! The most delicious, fluffy, light pancake I have ever eaten, with the Tiramisu option. We also had a savoury option with cheese omelette, also good. There is usually a queue so we arrived just before opening at 11 and were 12th in the queue so we're inside for first orders. The entrance is below ground level, down stairs so not obvious if walking past. There is a ticket machine on left of entrance to get a slip with a number for queuing.
Service was very polite and efficient. Nice seeing the spotless kitchen and how the pancakes are made.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

After returning from Kitashinchi lunch, my sister and I stopped by to buy some food.
I don't have time to eat cake

I went there with the intention of buying custard and chocolate.

That. . . The usual custard and chocolate versions are missing. .

Or rather, it was changed to custard and Halloween chocolate.
Batshaped chocolate
Red particles. .

red? What does that mean?

The price was also higher than usual.

I am grateful that my sister gave me a present.
I received it, but

Red grains, crunchy texture

The chocolate bat was also delicious.

The box was cute and Halloweenthemed. The whale Marine cake is too cute. By noon, there were only two left. There are many other cute cakes besides Marinkun. You can eat in at the seats in the back. Since it's a onedrink system, I ordered a mixed juice and was surprised to find that it was chewy. For parking, use a nearby coin parking lot. Poire's petit choux, which I have been buying for years.
There are two Poire stores in Kitashinchi, and the other one is a baked confectionery store.
Great as a souvenir or for home use, it's an affordable item that's sure to please
The eatin space inside the store is also popular.
The cakes are beautiful and delicious, but I really like the petit choux here 
The choux pastry is very soft and fluffy
The cream is small but heavy.
Not too sweet, you can eat as many as you want
There are also cream puffs mixed with chocolate and topped with fruit. naaami.737

I spotted the place around an hour before closing and the owners were really nice. Got the Hozenji night parfait. It had great matcha chiffon and ice cream. For matcha lovers, would recommend!

The nice music is also a plus! Im not local and Im new to this area of Osaka, near Tanimachi and I would like to buy a surprise cake for my wife. Good thing that the owner is very responsive via google maps chat, I sent him my location and we were able to transact via google translate even without a local number. Delivered very fast and quality birthday cake. Very elegant and the owner is very friendly and courteous. If you're looking for some delicious dessert in Osaka, I would highly recommend BooBoo Pink! My partner and I stopped by late on a Friday evening at 9 pm because we were craving some cake and couldn't have been happier with the result!

We got the cake set, which includes a slice of cake and a beverage! We chose the Early Grey flavored chiffon cake and paid an extra 100 yen to get a refreshing iced Hojicha tea! The cake was decadent but light and just slightly sweet, pairing perfectly with the tea.

We also got the PortofinoTiramisu, which is a Tiramisu shaved ice dessert! The ice was perfectly shaved and melted on the tongue. The Premium cocoa powder was perfect, being just sweet enough! Hidden underneath the dessert was some coffee jelly that was an awesome surprise and definitely completed the entire dish.

We were also lucky enough to be given a free sample of another one of their delicious chiffon cakes.

The total came out to about 20 USD, or about 3100 yen. Trust me when I say it's worth checking out Boo Boo Pink! I went to BooBooPink late at night, near closing, hoping to see whether I could get a last minute cake for my father's birthday. I was thoroughly surprised to hear that they were able to make me a cake if I waited a bit, and I was touched by the fact they were able to make something special even though it was so late!

The cake was absolutely delicious, not too sweet, and the cream was fresh as ever it was made right before my eyes!. The price was reasonable as well. I was offered also some water and food as I waited. Everyone there was so incredibly friendly and kind to me. I want to thank BooBooPink again for making my father's birthday memorable for both him and myself! I don't write reviews ever, but I had to for this place. We had a great cake and tea at BooBoo Pink! The staff were lovely and we will return.","Monday: Closed

The location is just wrong, if it had been placed closer to the Umekita Plaza things would have been so much better. Also the prices for their pick and mix chocolates are outlandish. 150 yen for one miniature piece of cremino?? Is it in Rome's price range? I felt it was expensive Setsuko, this is not uni! Osaka!

You'll be lost to the brink
But that's part of the fun of being a gelato shop.
No matter which one you choose, it's sure to be rich.

This popular pastry shop be prepared to wait! features a signature Custard Cream  Strawberries Millefeuille. It's a delightful dessert  a light strawberry millefeuille with their homemade custard cream, all nestled in a delicious and wellbaked savory almond pie crust.

The wait is even more exciting because you can watch their skilled staff freshly prepare each millefeuille right in front of you, adding to the anticipation before you dig into this delicious treat I love the flavours and crisp of the pastry. The crust is thin. Even my elderly mom enjoyed it. We tried both savoury and sweet. Perfect for a bite I recently ordered the seasonal melon pie and was thoroughly impressed. The pie was crispy and caramelized to perfection, creating a delightful texture. The melon was fresh and sweet, perfectly complementing the pie crust.

The service staff was prompt and efficient with the takeout order. The pie was prepared in minutes, and there was no queue, making the experience smooth and convenient. This was supposed to be a longlineup dessert restaurant but I was very lucky that I didn't have to wait on the day I visited the place.  Scrumptious dessert and special mix of  ingredients make this dessert place worth visiting.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Ruggeri,"2-chōme-8-93 Nanbanaka, Naniwa Ward, Osaka, 556-0011, Japan",4.4,34.6621848,135.5007563,"A nice little ice cream shop that has a good selection of flavours and a small inside seating area where you can sometimes watch the ice cream being made.

The pistachio and chocolate hazelnut ice creams are my favourites but the black cherry sherbet was also nice and refreshing.

The quality and serving sizes are great, especially for the price. Ice cream is unexpectedly good and tasty
Excellent staff service and the portion for tasting is quite generous too
Indoor dining area is also quite spacious
Very close to Namba station
It usually closes on Wed and some occasional days though Recommendation to first time foodies
Pistachio

My personal fav
Avocado, Mont Blanc

It was so good that I had 2 cups!

the first cup standard avocado  yogurt, standard pistachio, seasonal mont Blanc  newly picked tea.

The second cup seasonal jasmine tea with milk, seasonal bing cherry sherbet and standard mont blanc again.

In order of my liking


Avocado
100 Not sweet
Very rich very thick


Mont Blanc
95 not sweet
The chestnut flavor is rich


Jasmine tea
Not sweet 


Pistachio
Pistachio is their  most recommended item. They use the rarest pistachio that is only harvested every other year for the strongest flavor.
The aroma of pistachio is indeed very strong and aromatic. However, too sweet to my liking. But I dont like anything sweet so its just me. I would recommend pistachio to everyone who comes here the first time. It is a memorable taste.

Note
 The shop is quite small. Only 8 seats.
 early morninglunch time less crowded
 staff does not speak English.

They only have 3 standard flavors
Pistachio, chocolate hazelnuts, avocado  yogurt

All the other flavors
are seasonal.
they change it every 3 months. Arrived quite late when they were closing the store but they still welcomed customers!
It would be regretting if I didnt try their ice cream! Its best of the best ice cream for my entire trip to Osaka.
Didnt plan and expect, just passing by after having ramen in a shop nearby.
The taste of Sake strawberry is amazing, matcha is always as good as it should be.
Definitely will come back for next trip to Osaka. It doesn't come cheap but it's definitely very tasty! As others have mentioned, the pistachio is great and the mango is perfect to refresh yourself in those hot summer months!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

A lovely couple runs this little cafe and they are very nice and friendly.  The aroma from their freshly made baked goods fills the cafe and it smells amazing. My wife enjoyed her cup of americano coffee so much that she ordered a second cup right away. I very much enjoyed my glass of white grape juice which was new to me.

We commented to the owners that we liked the artwork on the walls and found out they were made by their children. They shared a video with us of their daughter painting one of the pictures that we loved.

We purchased a couple of handmade coasters to remember our visit to Tawanico coffee. We would visit this cafe again next time we are in Osaka. Our friend from Osaka invited us over from New Zealand and recommended this place. They have the best sweets and their Tawanico Blend coffee is great for everyone even for new coffee drinkers. If you want to relax or practise your Japanese then this is the place to to  Went searching for Tawanoa but found Tawanico instead. They are sister cafes. Tawanico has awesome cakes and very aromatic coffee. Great for a pit stop to have sweets  coffee before continuing. Cute coffee shop. Relaxing music. And most importantly, great coffee. Stop off here on the way to Osaka Castle! Yum! We stopped in for coffee and cake while visiting Osaka. The cakes were sensational! Almost too beautiful to eat but too delicious not to.

The kids and adults loved it here. This place is incredible! Super authentic Belgian waffles. The owner is incredibly kind and super quick to serve you! If youre in Osaka, you MUST visit this place. The waffles are super soft and the freshly squeezed apple juice is INCREDIBLE. You must order the apple juice if you visit The waffles were really good. It was light, crispy and fluffy. And it goes so well with banana and chocolate. The chocolate milk seemed recommended on their online menu so we gave it a try. I was impressed they had various percentage of cocoa content. I myself like a dark bitter chocolate bite so I ordered one with 80 cocoa. It was very good. The owner is very friendly and they have doggies near the counter and they too are super friendly! The waffles are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and taste great with an ice cream pairing. The owner is very friendly and welcoming, and there are also 2 well behaved pets near the counter. Ambience was very pleasing and comfortable, a great place to hang out with family and friends. Delicious delicious waffle, hot and crunchy with a lovely soft middle. Served fresh the strawberries on top were so good on their own but even better on top of a waffle","Monday: Closed

A must do!!  watch the world go by I bought it as a souvenir when I visited Osaka a few years ago, and I liked it so much I bought it again recently. The castella tastes just as good as before. Unfortunately it was late when I visited, so they were out of the kiln castella and I wasn't able to try it. I hope to be back again! Ginso castella! I dont like bread and sweets that much, so it wasnt that good for me. But for people who enjoy dessert, they would love it   Cake tastes really nice.

There is also a small cafe area with a few seats for eating in. Recommend the ice latte with muffins although the tiramisu looks really good too. Will come again. Laidback place that serves really delicious muffins and coffee. It's some distance away from Osaka castle but it's worth the walk.

This place is a 8mins walk from Tenma Station and it's worth the walk! The shaved ice Kakigori is substantially filled with ingredients and the ice is of very good quality that did not melt quickly even though it's so warm.

There's indoor and outdoor seating and you can request for an English menu. Though take note that the English menu only have the basic Kakigori flavours without their food and drinks items.

I will suggest that you look at the wall for ""Seasonal speciality"" flavours. Even if you don't read Japanese, you can understand their cute and beautiful drawings.

We had the Mango Kakigori at 1000 and it's worth every yen.

Awesome place and I will highly recommend a visit!!!! I would say this is the best kakigori Ive had so far I had the peach. Peach chunks were generous, and was a great refresher in the summer heat.

My companion did not like the chocolate one very much though. I really recommend this place for kakigori!
It was a bit tricky to find this place since google maps doesnt work optimally in Japan. However, when we finally found it, we loved it at first sight! It ls a really cozy place where you have to take off your shoes if you want to sit on the mats.

They have a menu with pictures but also seasonal specials which are promoted with handdrawn posters. We found the small already quite big, but to was just too tasty that we ordered one more! And we also tried some of the takiyaki and the hojicha tea 

Our favorite is the mango kakigori  Delightful shop with indoor and outdoor seating. They have both savory and sweet items. Had a cosy cup of coffee and a stellar anmitsu","Monday: Closed

Anyway I had a hummus pita and a kebab, food was very tasty and they were very generous with the hummus portion, although it was served in a wrap rather than a pita. Still, Im not picky so it was fine.
The kebab was very nice and the owner gave me some extra spice too.
Nice little place with friendly staff, cant complain!
A little on the expensive side is all, but fairly standard for Japanese prices!
Will definitely come back and try some of the other options! The place is nice, has a varied menu with reasonable prices. The location is quite convenient and easy to reach. We enjoyed our Persian and middle eastern food here very much in Osaka. I am always a fan of Persian food and this restaurant did not disappoint at the heart of Osaka !
The owner was great at greeting us and making sure we are served great food !
Food is amazing, simple, and tasty
We brought our Japanese friends here and they really enjoyed it as well. Highly recommended if you wanna try Persian food!
Went there for lunch on Saturday.

The staff was very kind.
He speaks both English and Japanese.
And the service was fast too.

It was my first time trying Persian cuisine and everything was DELICIOUS!! This is the best and most delicious food I've ever eaten in japan.
The prawns rice was something else, so tasty.
The kabab was perfectly seasoned and cooked.

It's on the second floor, to get in go straight through to the lift where the sign is on the street and go to the second floor2F. The lift doors open straight up into the food place An unassuming place for it's food, but it was amazing! Delicious ramen that I got, i would recommend to those looking for a humble but tasty vegan dish in a slightly unexpected atmosphere. Would come again and recommend to anyone in the future for it's food, the drinks were also decent Very friendly  nice staffs here. Enjoyed their company as well! The drinks were affordable and strong enough. Especially the Fireball shot! Will patronize again next time when we are back to Osaka  Fire Cafe in Osaka is an absolute gem, and as an American rapper who loves to hit the nightlife, I can't recommend it enough!

From the moment you step inside, the vibrant atmosphere hits you like a bass drop. The decor is on point, blending modern aesthetics with a cozy vibe that makes you feel right at home. The staff? Super friendly and always ready to mix up a killer cocktail or recommend the best dishes on the menu.

If you're into live music, you might just catch a local artist performing, adding to the already electric ambiance.

Whether you're out with friends or looking for a chill spot to unwind, Fire Cafe delivers a fivestar experience that keeps you coming back for more. If you're in Osaka, make sure to swing by and soak in the good vibes! One the best Ramens I have ever had. Wow absolutely incredible. Staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming had an amazing experience. I highly recommend you visit this place!

Awesome restaurant! Went twice, once in Tokyo and once in Osaka, and loved both of them! Super affordable and great good. We really did eat a lot and it wasnt more than 35. Id definitely recommend! A place with chill vibes and staff who treat you like a Osaka King, this is it! Tourist can even scan a QR code for an English menu techsavvy dining! 

I wanted to try a bit of everything... Ended up there's this ""set menu"" of their noodle, fried rice and the fried dumpling called Gyoza FlavourExplosion!  The gyoza? Packed with so much flavor, and follow my picture on how to let it soak with maximum vinegar for maximum flavour bathe it in a spoon tub.  And the fried rice? Finish it with the dumpling before the noodle 

And remember to do a Google review to try a free soft drink or Ice cream! 

Being a king is lonely.... So if you become a line friend with them, they will treat you to a coupon, free gyoza right nowwww or the next time without any purchase!! Just be careful not to accidentally press ""use coupon"", or your king won't honour it. Now to enjoy my free machaaaaa hahahaha. I was just out and about in Namba looking for good, cheap food.
Then I discovered this place near the Kuromon market.
The food was quite good and the staff very friendly.
If you want to eat for less than 12, take a look. Very chill vibes. Staff who are very kind. With the option to have a English menu by scanning a  QR code! We got one of their ramen sets!

Was looking forward to this place but it was just junk food they used frozen vegetables and potatoes.. not fresh at all. You order and pay when you go in and then you have to go downstairs and collect your food  fast food vibes and tasting. You can get a drink and help yourself to the alcohol but its very cheap and two drinks made me feel terrible the next day. The place is really cool and quirky and has potential but the food is just veggie vegan junk food. I don't have any dietary restrictions but I ate here and their okonomiyaki is really good! It tastes healthy since it doesn't use flour.

The downside is the really long wait to get in. I came here Friday at dinner time and it took me an hour to wait in a long line outside. You can go in early and buy some drinks while you wait.

After you are called in, you order at the front desk and then find your seat anywhere in the building. The owner will call your number via the intercom when your food is ready.

It is actually amazing that one woman runs the whole thing! This is an incredible place! This restaurant  has a great atmosphere and amazingly delicious food. The owner of the establishment is a very friendly person, who runs the place by herself alone! We were impressed by her hard work! Despite waiting in line, we enjoyed our visit, this place has a super positive vibe and various vegan and vegetarian options, highly recommended! I had this place on my itinerary since planning our trip as it caters for Vegetarians however the experience was so much better than I expected.
The restaurant is ran by one lady called Shiho, she takes the orders and makes everything.

We ordered two vegetarian medium Okonomiyakis and one vegetable yakisoba. For a medium the Okonomiyaki was massive, it was super tasty and when you order you can choose 5 vegetables you want in it and if you want cheese, vegan cheese or none.
Taking the order was really quick and easy.

As OKO opened up at 6 we got there 40 minutes early to queue, other people didn't start queuing until 5.30, as this is ran by one person then there will be a wait for food the longer in the queue you are.
We were first and we only had to wait maybe 20 minutes at most for our food, probably less.

Shiho speaks through a microphone and will call your number to go and collect the food from the bottom floor. You can also talk to Shiho through the microphone as well, we said that we were on our way to collect the food.

Each table you clean yourself, there are wipes in packages on the side and each table has plastic over it.
It was very clean when we sat down and we made sure to keep it that way.

It you are visiting please remember to tidy up after yourselves and be patient if you are waiting to be served.

A great experience and was nice and filling to! Incredible Okonomiyaki place run by Shiho alone. Props to her she does everything from taking orders to cooking. The menu is vegetarian and vegan friendly, and you can choose how you want it made along with a few other dishes. The place has several floors so find a seat and enjoy. The serving was huge! I wasn't expecting so much for a medium size. It was absolutely delicious and happy I got to try this dish as a vegetarian. You can also make your mark by writing on the walls. You can pay with card here but I believe the alcohol which is on tap needs to be paid in cash and is 200 Yen per glass.","Monday: 6:00 – 11:00 PM

Been there a few times and the food is always consistent in taste and quality.
Fast and friendly service.
Always feel welcome when eating here. Amazing curry!!!the spice level on the curry was perfect. There is limited seating. So when you get here you have to go inside and order on the machine what you want. After you order what you want on the machine it will print out a paper and you will wait until you are called. Well, this was the situation when we went because it was busy. But the wait is worth it, it goes by fast.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 4:30 PM, 5:30 – 10:00 PM

Ichiran Ramen Dotonbori - South Building,"1-chōme-4-16 Dōtonbori, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0071, Japan",4.3,34.6684219,135.5032242,"This is a benchmark of how a good ramen should taste. The food was good, but the queue was terrible. Prepare to wait for one hour late at night. It was so long that I had to go there for breakfast to satisfy my cravings.

Try ordering rice and eat with the soup. Great experience! The wait was very hot and long BUT I do think its worth it if youve never been. The ramen booths are so cool. You get a direct water line. And you dont have to talk to anyone. Also the food is very cheap and delicious. Fun experience, you order via vendo machine, sit alone at an empty booth and someone will open the window in front of you to serve your ramen. You cant stay too long since a lot of people in queue arw waiting for you to finish. Patience is a must since the queue is always long! Ichiran Ramen is so famous that no introduction needed. We decide to try one here since we at Japan. One word to describe, great.
We came around late night 11pm and actually manage to get in around 10 minutes. Theres an order sheet that you have to choose your preference of the ramen broth, noodles texture and condiments. I choose noodle with firm texture and rich broth and its perfect for my need. The broth is so good that Im actually finished it.
The concept is also special with you sit on your own cubicle and the ramen will served to you in front of the cubicle like a fast food concept. Quite a great experience. This ramen spot certainly lives up to its reputation 6800 reviews and counting!. The wildly popular Ichiran Ramen warns you that at its busiest time, the wait in line just to have a seat in its single booth is 6070 minutes.

And it was worth it! The broth is light, but savory and salty without going overboard. The medium spicy was good but I'll go one or two step up, as well as one more beyond the medium garlic.

I'm glad I got the firm noodle as recommended by a few, and I'll try one softer next time.

The tonkotsu slices are lean and tasty. The whole dish just works so well together.

And the experience of receiving your food through the window behind a bamboo curtain is unique and unforgettable. It really adds to the atmosphere!

Love this place and I'll wait another hour for another serving!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Halal Ramen Honolu Osaka Namba,"2-chōme-5-27 Motomachi, Naniwa Ward, Osaka, 556-0016, Japan",4.5,34.6622801,135.4955777,"One of the best ramens Ive ever eaten. Not only is the overall taste good, but the broth and chicken are also on point. I always come here with my friend, and whenever people visit Osaka and ask me for a good halal shop, I always bring them here. Five stars for everything . Had some delicious Spicy Fried Chicken Ramen here and Gyoza as well.

My only suggestion would be to ask the Spicy Fried Chicken on the side so it maintains its crisp.

I found the prices quite reasonable for the amount and the fact its halal.

The place can seat maybe 1015 people so theres a chance there may be a wait.
Keep in mind youll need cash to pay at the ordering machine. The best spicy ramen I've ever had. Still craving for this one. Everytime I go to Osaka, I'd make sure to include a trip to this small restaurant. It is quite out of the way but located within walking distance from the nearest train station. The seats are very limited, much like many of the Japanese shops here so time yourself well and go outside holiday season or peak hours if you can. We ordered spicy ramen, gyoza and chicken which was very delicious. However place was a bit tight, can only host 10 guest at one time..so have to come early for your seatings. Other that that, staff was friendly as well. Also you have to pay first at the kiosk before seating down. Really delicious ramen, liked the friendly staff and atmosphere. If you need to spice your life up, come and try the spicy chicken here. No cap. Thank you","Monday: 11:30 AM – 2:00 PM, 5:00 – 9:00 PM

I went for dinner and enjoyed my meal!!
The restaurant itself is pretty compact and has limited seats  theyd start to reject customers if its packed usually during their peak hours like 9pm. So just call them before coming in to make a reservation or to just check if they have a spot for you. Amazing place although a bit small.
Easily full. I think can fit only about 20 ppl max.

But food was superb and most importantly halal. The chef was turkish who speaks japanese and the lady was also super friendly Turkish restaurant in the middle of Osaka. You can find the place by looking at the Turkish flag. They have lunchdinner set with more economical price. The taste was good and plentiful. Maybe in peak time, reservations are recommended. Really tasty fresh Turkish food.
After 15 days of Japanese food  we really needed some good middle eastern food,
So we came with high expectations, and was not disappointed.
The cook also serves the tables, and some how both the service and the food were excellent.
Everything came out fast, fresh and warm.
Definitely worth the relatively expensive price. I found tasty halal turkish meals here. At first I doubted the taste of the mackarel sandwich. But then after the first bite it turned out to be sooo yummy. They are perfect combination of materials for a sandwich. Combined with the cold mashed potatoes and hot lentil soup, they even enrich its taste.
I also tried the chef kebab taken out. The lamb meat is sooo delicate. It is well composed with the mashed potato inside the pastry outer skin. I bet the taste is even more appetizing when you eat it in the restaurant.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 2:30 PM, 5:00 – 10:30 PM

Originally we wanted ramen but the store next door only took cash so we walked across the street. Saw the reservation sign and was about to leave but decided to ask first. Meal took 2030min to arrive as theres only one chef, but its worth the wait. What a find! One evening in Osaka, we discovered that most places required reservations, so we wandered until we stumbled upon this charming Mexican spot. I savored two tacos, with pork and beef, while my husband opted for chicken. They were delicious, and I found myself wishing for more even after finishing. The only thing missing was some salsa or pico de gallo, but everything we had was tasty. Spent my 33rd birthday here and had the best time with the team and customers alike. Living in California, I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and couldn't have been more impressed with Mexican Ola Tacos Bar. This restaurant makes the best Mexican Food i've had so far. I love Mexican Food and they did so amazing. So flavorful which i like. The server was so nice and good service.

They made everybody feel welcome. My wife was especially ecstatic about being there. Definitely was pleasantly surprised by the experience! My wife loved the place so much and it made her extremely happy. Food was also surprisingly delicious. The Hamburg steak and omurice was super tasty!
They were very attentive and upbeat. I really enjoyed my experience. We asked for the maid to draw a pikachu and she was so amazing! Check out the photo. A whole new Maid experience with 1000 service, including nice meals. Specially recommending strawberry milkshake. The other desserts taste perfect  highly recommend this home for all of the masters and princesses First time in Japan, we wanted to try this and were a bit shy, but the waitress was accommodating despite not speaking English and sometimes used Google translate.

Food is cute, but of course the prices are a tad high, since you're also paying for the high energy service. You can also order via phone if you're very introverted.

My brother did not like it at all, but for me it was quite an alright experience. Would probably go again with someone else next time. If you want to experience Japanese maid cafe, this is the No.1 place to go in Osaka. It was Oct.13, my last day in Japan. And I decided to spend the afternoon here to relax from my morning shopping. 1 About the food. They were surprisingly good. Strongly recommend the Yakitori skewers. The performance drink also tasted good. Plus an interesting performance. 2 About live dance. I ordered two of the live danceone famous , and one of their original songs. Maid girl named Shampoo performed really amazing of these two dances especially , I can feel that was not easy. Other customers also ordered some dances from other maid girls, which gave me the opportunity to see more amazing cute dances. 3 They also offered socalled lotterybefore live dances, for 880 yen each time. Its basically guaranteed to win something. I was lucky to get the First Prize in the first trial. The prize was a group photo with ALL the maid girls in the cafe. 4 As it was my last day there, I wanted to try as many things as possible, so my expense might be a little higher but still reasonable. For the memories, happiness and experience I got, it was worth it. Nyan Nyan!
P.S. I dont know if I can post the picture of maid girls here, so I only posted the food in this review.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 11:00 PM

Open early in the morning and you can find lot of fresh seafood over here. Huge variety of seafood with different pricing available and you can eat over there. You can compare with several stall and decide. Kobe beef is also famous over here and I quite enjoy it as the beef literally melts in my mouth. Plenty of street food also available here that one day is not enough that you might visit here another day. One of the best seafood and fresh produce markets we've been to. You can select what you want and the store will cook and serve it at the store. Also sake tasting stalls. Many others for souvenirs etc. It's touristy and not the cheapest but a good experience. Nice market to enjoy mostly seafood and whatever else you like! Prices are reasonable and the service is fast. You can find pretty much anything you wish for. Definitely worths checking out. Such a fun market. The prices of the fish are so good! I could get a whole fillet of bluefin tuna for only 2000yen! I went here for breakfast and it wasnt too crowded and it was so cool. There are so many seafood options, from Urchin to Fugu, and definitely worth a visit while youre in Osaka. Kuromon market is a mustvisit in Osaka. The entire street is inundated with mouthwatery food stalls. You will have to choose wisely in order not to over budget your calorie count.

The rice and egg portion is very generous, but do take note that the meat portion is a bit small. This is a popular spot with locals and tourists, and the waiting time can be quite awhile, but you can walk around while monitoring your queue number on their website. The staff are all very patient and polite! Thank you for having us!  During our trip to Osaka, my group of four had the pleasure of dining at Hokkyokusei, and it was an experience to remember! We were seated right away without any wait, which was fantastic for a busy city like Osaka. The restaurant specializes in traditional ""omurice"", and it truly lived up to the hype. The omurice was absolutely delicious, and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting.

The ambiance is also something specialvery traditional with a lot of charm, making it a memorable experience, especially for tourists like ourselves. It felt like we were stepping into a piece of Japanese culture, adding to the overall enjoyment of the meal.

The staff were friendly and attentive, always making sure we were comfortable. As for pricing, its quite reasonable, with omurice dishes ranging from 1080 to 2100 yen, making it an affordable yet authentic dining option in Osaka. Whether youre a local or a visitor, Hokkyokusei is definitely worth a stop! Food is quite alright. The egg was drier than expected. The curry sauce was pretty good though.
We were seated in the bigger room with tatami seating without the garden view and it was quite hot and stuffy inside with the other three groups of guests. I'd suggest requesting for a private room if you have a party of 34 and you might have a way better view. Good omurice served fast on traditional tatami mats and popular among locals and tourists. At first, there is a ticketing system to keep for a seat. But that line goes by rather quickly, especially since the restaurant is so big. Most of the menu here is only omurice, but there are many different toppings to choose from chicken or ham or beef stew. Food comes out quickly. Would go here again. Unassuming from the outside, it aims to let you have an authentic Japanese experience. The garden in the middle adds a pleasant touch, and Im just grateful to still be able to cross my legs as the seating is tatami style. The food can be characterised as homey, like the one being made by someones mom or grandma. Recommended for a quick fill.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 9:30 PM

The Japanese hamburger steak is their specialty.  You can also get a Kobe beef hamburger steak instead.  Give this place a try if you are in the area. i was eager for an eel bowl at lunch and didn't mind to pick a chain store. although it's a china, the quality is kept consistent and guaranteed. simple eel bowl set just around 4,000 yen but very promising. the eel was fat and juicy. in addition we ordered an eel egg roll and an eel liver skewer, i think both are the must try item in every eel restaurant in japan. both were good. it's slightly after lunch time so plenty of seats. Never a big fan for deep fried pork cutlet, but this one at Nanba Osaka was pretty good. Very crispy outer bread crust  still reasonably tender pork inside. Steam rice  cabbage salad are all you can eat. Pretty good services. Considering the price, it was quite attractive. Love both deep fried pork chop  oysters   Children friendly, foods are very home cook. As you can see, it's a feast to the eyes too. No rushing to finish the meal and no pressure.

I requested seats with backrest, because my dad needs it. We were then taken to the bar area on the first floor.

Then I went to the second floor to the toilet and saw empty tables and chairs with back rest. Requested to change the seats and was denied by the chef, said its all full.

The food we received were not consistent, two pieces of the beef tongue were like from yesterday and reheated pale  looking ones hidden behind the fresh ones  very difficult to chew. The oysters had a strong taste, not fresh at all.

I dont recommend the place, not family friendly, chef has attitude. Id give it a better rating, however an old chef was extremely rude to me and my family. He yelled at us in front of the entire store over his own misunderstanding, refused to back down or understand, and only calmed down when another chef told him he misunderstood. Whats even better, he refused to apologize. I really want to recommend this place but with such atrocious service I really cant. If you plan on coming, beware this guy and dont be surprised if youre yelled at for no reason. Beef tongue is chewy and bouncy.
The soup is reasonably good.
Pickles n miso provide the saltiness .
Portion on the low side, price on the high side
A different experience for those who has never tried the beef tongue. Would I go there again? Would prefer premium beef steak cut, unlikely Great grilled beef tongue and gyutan shabushabu for my dinner in Osaka! Amazing place with very good, honest and local food.

We came at around 730, so the restaurant was practically empty. Choosing omakase was a great choice as we got to try a brilliant selection of fresh cuts. Two plates of 5 pieces for 1300 yen each feels like Im robbing this place with how much of a steal it is. I saw another review complaining about the waiting time, but I feel that they didnt take much time between the two  it was just a short break to enjoy the sushi. The waitress was also very attentive and friendly managed to get a whole mountain of gari upon request. Probably the freshest sushi you can get unless you want to eat the fish alive. Fantastic quality. I love to Miso Soup too. Strong taste and not the commercial type. The place is small and expect long queue. Try not to go during peak hours. Will visit again when in Osaka. Come here. That is all.       It you want more to my reasoning start that it is perfect. You wander out of the busy city into a working fish market to a lonely stall. You have entered a new space.     You want more reasons? You are still reading? Fine, you can Ignore the fact that the staff is impeccable and kind. Ignore the thoughtfulness on every dish and in the best soup I have ever had a clam and miso umami bomb you will remember on your death bed.
Ignore all that and focus on the sushi, some of the best in the world without doubt. Flaky eel, perfectly boiled crab and a tuna that has the smallest amount of connective tissue holding together delicious fatty flesh.
Come here. Come a bit early. Then come again. They open at 630 and are open until 130. You can come twice in one day. We made a trek out to Endo Sushi because we still remember how good and fresh the sushi was from 7 years ago.  Location a little hard to get to especially coming from Noda Station. Lots of trucks and cars driving fast to the Market. We waited maybe 30 min or so on a Saturday around 1015 am.  It might have been longer but didnt feel like it. There were about 34 parties before us. When we left around 1110ish, there was a line of maybe 1520 people waiting outside. Sushi options 1 and 2 are the best deals.  One can swap one fish out. The salmon is so soft, it almost melts in the mouth. Uni was fresh.  Partner had the clam miso soup and enjoyed it. We each ate three plates.  Fresh sushi made upon order. The queue is long due to very limited seat inside. Price is very reasonable for the quality given. All the set is only 1300yen for five pieces of sushi including one toro piece.","Monday: 6:15 AM – 1:30 PM

People were standard in terms of service, typical Japanese. The menu can be ordered on the screen, which is really helpful for all. Lots of seating and a great selection of food. They have specials on certain fishes that are limited and must be tried as they are flown in from Hokkaido. If you're in the grant front or Umeda area, definitely check out. Pretty good for train sushi, not bad for quality and value and they had a number of fresh items from Hokkaido when we were there including Hokkaido scallops which were delicious.

Tourist friendly, can order additional items off tablet with English menu. Would recommend. Came here for a later night snack, went exclusively for the salmon, and it did not disappoint! Several different cuts of salmon, and they were amazing. Only con is the price is definitely on the higher side for rotating sushi, but so is the quality. The food tasted okay. The sashimi I had was a little rubbery and the eel was not soft.
The sushi didn't look that fresh nor did it taste that fresh.
Would not go out of the way to come back here. We visited this sushi bar around tea time and got a bar seat which gave us a great view of the sushi chef as he prepared our meal. We ordered unagi, tuna and salmon sashimi. All were great, with a special mention to the salmon sashimi which was absolutely delicious. Service was also extremely prompt, and the chef was really quick. Thank you!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Luckily, as a single diner, I could eat quickly before reservations had the place booked. It's quite small, so I recommend going early.

I ordered the salmon pasta, which was pretty good. Not quite as good as my own homemade pasta, bit the presentation tableside was a really nice touch.

The dishes are a bit on the expensive side, especially given their size 2000 yen. But, it is not absurdly expensive. If you want meat or wine here, be ready to cough up 45000 yen each. I just wanted pasta, so I can not comment on the other dishes

Overall, it's a place with good food and nice presentation, that is trying to go for a more upscale atmosphere. What a fantastic little Italian restaurant! Hand made pasta in a beautiful 5 table venue that I believe is run by father and son. You wont be left disappointed with generous sized pasta portions, warm bread and friendly service including a demonstration of how the pasta youve ordered is made. A really lovely venue all round. This fourtable fatherandsonrun Italian restaurant is an absolute gem. From the moment we walked in the door, we were treated as family. The waiter, who is the son of the 77yearold Italiantrained chef and father, was especially attentive and caring of our 5yearold daughter. The freshlymade pasta was some of the best weve ever had, which is saying a lot considering Italian is our familys favorite food. The garden salad was fresh and perfectly seasoned with tomatoes that were absolutely out of this world. And the tiramisu was to die for. We would have gone back the next night had we not been departing Osaka for Kyoto. Make a reservation, as the space is tight and demand is high. Dont miss this duo! Small quaint restaurant that seats less than 20 specializing in handmade pastas. All the dishes were done well here, with a special mention of that chicken porcini mushroom and the al dente texture of the pasta. It's great that the chefowner still personally prepares all the dishes by himself instead of hiring line cooks because it really adds to the character of the dish and restaurant likewise. Fresh pasta, would recommend the tiramisu as well. The waiter seemed a bit rude at first because he spoke to us with a raised voice upon entering and cut me off as I spoke, but he spoke normally afterwards so it was overall alright.","Monday: Closed

Though it seems the cooking oil could be old and service is not so friendly. We can't eat the miso soup due to its saltiness. Maybe it's a local taste  Curry was rich and flavourful! Cutlet was thick and tender! Yum!
Staff was friendly and English menu is available for tourist. This place should have more  reviews!

 the staff was friendly and professional,
 the food came fast and it was amazing!
 Really convenient place between the entrance of the castle and the train station,
 Great value for what you get!
 Ive tried the tonkatsu pork cutlet and suggest you try the same with any combination.  Seriously the worst restaurant I have been so far in Osaka. Our group of 4 people have to split in two to seat on the bench for single people dine because they put two people to seat on the table of 4. Seriously one time only, food is not worst trying to eat. Never comeback against. TonKatsu in the garden offers a delightful dining experience. The ambiance is serene, and the food is exquisite with a blend of flavors that truly stand out. Highly recommended !","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Especially, the suadero tacos were absolutely  divine. Went there with my Mexican friend and he was very satisfied with the quality as well. This place is seriously good! I did not come to Japan to try Mexican but wow  I would really recommend all the tacos in particular.

Also the staff were able to confirm which items on the menu gluten free  everything except the soup!  which is great to know as a celiac.

Plus all the staff and super friendly and speak a decent amount of english. Other reviews mention making a booking  we tried calling and no luck, but we came on a Thursday and had a seat straight away. Although we did try to drop by on Saturday and it was booked out. I can't believe we found an authentic Mexican place in Osaka, Japan. The food and drinks are AMAZING. At least one staff member speaks English and some Spanish.

If you're missing home while abroad, stop here for a taste of Mex. Mexican here, certifying these tacos as the best in Osaka! You must try them. I recommend suadero, adobada and carnitas. And please get the guacamole and chips, its a must appetizer.
And their Jamaica water is a perfect balance between sweetness and sourness that will refresh you and make you want more.
Will definitely be back. Gracias! Top tier, way better than I was expecting. The taste of the tacos and nachos were as good as in Mexico. Call in advance to book because they get full quick. The menu was easy to understand and all the ingredients are fresh. When I return to Osaka this will definitely be on my list! The wait is worth it, you will be surprised on how delicious the meat is and the size of the tacos are good.","Monday: Closed

It was incredibly quiet when we arrived at a weekday ahortly after lunch time service was efficient but polite, and food tasted really good! Nothing mindblowing but a solid tonkotsu. The sides were nice to sample too.

The presentation with the stream wafting off of it was impressive to see.  Pretty good pork cutlet but nothing too special in my opinion. Maybe something was lost in translation but we were turned away the first time only to come back and be let in a minute later. To be fair they were in a rush to close as it was late. This is located in an underground area of restaurants right in Dotonbori. You will recognize this place because it has a statue of a pig in front of the shop. The service was pretty all right as they were quick and efficient. They do have an English menu and accept credit cards. They are a chain from Nagoya, which is famous for the miso. I recommend ordering the halfhalf so you have two styles of katsu, at a very reasonable price. Both were very delicious. I usually dont ever order katsu but this was recommended as Osaka and Nagoyas speciality. The sauce is made from red miso but isnt overpowering. What I loved most was its efficiency, the juiciness and fattiness of the pork cutlet. Great place, great tonkatsu, staff is very helpful and they have english menu.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 2:30 PM, 5:00 – 8:30 PM

It provides halal meat, in addition to many types of wonderful meals. I recommend trying it. There is also a prayer room. The food is delicious and the service is great we were lucky to visit early at 12 to eat on Friday. As they had reservations at 1300 so better make a reservation. Booked much ahead of my lunch date here. Very quiet on a Wed morning at 11am. Did not opt for the Eat All You Can but an upgraded Brown Beef Wagyu instead.  Much cheaper eating set meal if you are not greedy. Food is okay but comparing with their competitor, this is below par. Halal bbq? Heck yeah! Absolutely amazing food at an amazing price. Came with my family for lunch and we got the red all you can eat course. Kids were only 500yen each which was a steal.

Recommended if you wanted to try Mexican food. Even though it was past the typical lunch rush hour, the seats were mostly full. We luckily came when there were open seats, but we saw others turned away. I was happy that there was a small discount during lunch hours on weekdays until 3PM I believe. My chicken burrito was not bad, but I also wished it had more flavor. If I visited again, I would try a different flavor. My partner liked his beef burrito well enough. We ordered guacamole to go with our chips, and it was good. Small complaint would be that the drink cup size was good, but as is common in Japan it came about  full and less than that if you take out the ice. Being from California, this place satisfies my need for good Mexican food in Osaka. The chicken burrito is amazing and the owners are so sweet. Delicious! I eat here semi regularly, and the burritos here are excellent, the size and taste is great and doesnt taste japanified at all, as so much foreign cuisine does here.
Less than 1000 for a big fat burrito, I recommend the chicken one personally. There is also a selection of world beers which is nice, the side menu offers some good stuff too but the burritos are by far the best.
The store itself is somewhat lacking in atmosphere but isnt bad by any means, and the lady owner can be rather cold in her service, but again not horrible or anything. Definitely worth a visit if youre craving a burrito! This cute diner is conveniently close to Yotsubashi station, and has vibes of a SoCal bistro. Offering more than 30 craft beers and liquor, the menu was condensed compared to most taco eateries in Osaka a welcome change to do a small menu well!
Food was prepared fresh with minimum wait, with sounds of the owner cooking in the background.
The food was very good, authentic. I will certainly return to this restaurant next time I am in Osaka.","Monday: Closed

Butter chicken is amazing, and Naan is fresh  crisp. Lot of places Naans are rubbery but this pla e serves very good well cooked Naan, my 10 year old kid loved it.
The staff is very friendly and hindi speaking. The place is bit tough to find, you really need to keep your eyes open while looking at the map. I just went to check if the negative reviews are true or not.

Yes, absolutely true.

Look at the bill. 4901200300  1990
They add 10 for tax which not written in the prices as you see in the pictures.

Be careful from this place!!

The food is small and you can not be full.

Aslo in paying the bill. I gave them 3089 that can give me back 900. But they counted and gave me only 722. I told them that is not true. Then they count it again and give me the 900.

Count your money and dont leave until you confirm that! Its nice to have in this big cross mall place esp for having vegan and vegetarian dishes. The taste was good but the plate was small and in terms of price was high in comparison to other restaurants that offer bigger dishes with the same or a hit lower price or with having the option of eating bread and rice as much as you like. Also no wifi but the service man was kind and supportive. Also social abd communicative A great find. If youre in the Umeda area and looking for tasty food with many delicious vegetarian options come here. Relaxing place with friendly staff and fair prices. I got the eggplant curry set and it was a passionate love affair with flavor. Food is OK
Charge 10 for tax without bill
I have tried at least 10 restaurant
No other place found charging tax on written amount
If tax is genuine than proper bill should be given. Tax is collected on behalf of govt not for additional income of restaurant owner.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 11:00 PM

And there was this little indoor mall kind of at the base of it. Inside was a little restaurant that sold the golden geese of Osaka cuisine, the Takoyaki and the Okonomiyaki.

We got an okonomiyaki. They usually come with a rich array of toppings and sauces. But this particular place had a topping bar, where you could completely customize what you put on top of yours. Very cool. I poured on a bit of bonito flakes and various sauces and we made a very good okonomiyaki.

It was delicious. Not exactly the same as getting it from street vendors, like you see on TV, but I was jonesing real bad and needed one ASAP. Not complaining. It was so good. The food was very expensive. Definitely some major tourist tax. It wasn't bad though. 900 yen for ice scream in a cone is WILD though. Total trap with the tourist tax.
750 yen for a coffee and its not even a full cup and not great compared to a lot of other coffee out there.
Food was ok, noting great.

Worst part is the price. Konamon Bar Rikyu, located near Osaka Castle, is a great spot tucked away from the crowds for those looking to indulge in Osaka's famous street food, offering a unique combo set for diners torn between okonomiyaki and takoyaki.
Even though the takoyaki was a little undercooked and the okonomiyaki wasn't the best I've had. The combination set is perfect for visitors who want to sample both without choosing one over the other.
The restaurant features a condiments bar where guests can customize their dishes with bonito flakes, okonomiyaki sauce, and mayo to their liking. Additionally, selfservice water is available, ensuring diners can enjoy their meal with ease.
This combination of decent food and the ability to personalize your dish makes Konamon Bar Rikyu an alright spot for visitors exploring the area around Osaka Castle. Absolutely the worst takoyaki ive had. I think being in osaka you should do yourself a favor and skip this place. There are so many very delicious takoyaki restaurants around. I made the mistake of coming here and paying 1200 yen for very bad takoyaki in my opinion. The staff was nice although, nothing to complain about just the food was not what i was into. Very mushy possibly raw. Definitely a spot to get tourists to spend extra money.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

There are many kind of food here, and I really recommend the masala curry with naan and samosa.

The masalas here are flavorful, and the spices inside are authentic! You can even meet the spices in your mouth!

The naan is really huge, authentic and scrumptious! If you prefer curry with rice, their rice is also great!

The samosa tastes stunning, crispy and mouthful!

I love their salad with sprouted green beans which is cute and appetizing.

The soup may be different everyday. I have tasted two kinds of soup during my visits. I love the flavor of the soup!

Last but not least, the snack and Lassi are good!

By the way, I boxed up the rest of the food, and I found it still delicious after several hours even without warming up it! Very cozy and super tasty Indian Restaurant in a basement. The portions are huge and you can choose how spicy you want it to be. Everything was delicious, the Nan as well. Highly recommended! Super priced Vegan restaurant near Dotonbori. Food is below average. Service is delayed because only one person serves all the customers and tables. I didn't know why it was  given such a high rating. May be mostly due to Vegan restaurant options. Prices are more than double compared to other Indian restaurants in Osaka. So called Veg biryani see picture they serve is just steamed rice with some veggies and spices. The location is in the basement and tiny. Nestled in the by lanes near the most crowded Dotombori, this is a peaceful hidden gem that services the BEST  most authentic vegetarian Indian food in Japan!! If you are in Osaka, please eat here. The food will you remind of you home  how. The vibe is too good. Best Jain Food I had in Osaka. Tasty food and amazing quantity. Cannot believe that I found this hidden gem in Osaka.

I ordered a Palak Paneer and naan that was so good that I came back the following day for more! Went here on the 14th for lunch as a colleague invited me. Was impressed with the stores decor! The food was excellent as well  lots of flavor!!! I ordered the keema curry rice set with coffee Lvl 5. Price came to about 900 and I was stuffed but I think the curry should have been way spicier. One star for service as none of the staff speak English which is a real downside The only Tibetan restaurant in Osaka where you get the best and authentic MOMO's. A must visit restaurant if you are interested in Tibetan food. They also have a wide range on Indian and Nepali food to choose from. There are various books and ornaments from and about Tibet which one can experience at the restaurant. It was amazing! I tried Nepal food for the first time and Im in love 
Also this place has a nice vibe. It was like trip to Nepal doesnt leave Osaka If you're looking for Tibetan or Indian food and atmosphere, I recommend the Snow Lion. Friendly staff, very nice looking place, and very tasty food.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

They also have an Osaka specialty corner, with local dishes from the neighboring areas of Kyoto, Kobe, Nagoya and Wakayama. With 200 seats available, space is not an issue. Overall, we enjoyed the food here over the 6 days staying at this hotel. Hidden gem inside the hotel.  Its a little bit cramped inside but most of the food is really delicious.  Staff is really quick in entertaining customers and quick in clearing up the tables.  Was not expecting a hotel restaurant to be this good! The food and the customer service from the people in the hall were very good, but I was really concerned about the elderly man in the kitchen who was cooking without his mask on.
They are forcing customers to wear masks, but I don't understand why they aren't doing so.
When that person comes out to the hall, he comes out with his nose sticking out, and are his shoes slippers? I don't think it's very hygienic as it looks like sandals.","Monday: 6:30 AM – 2:00 PM

Great little spot to wait while for your train As I was on the roll the battered prawns were not only quick but delicious along with a beer Visited June 2023
After traveling around Shikoku with some friends, I stayed with my friends back in Niigata in Okayama and had a nice brunch before splitting up in ShinOsaka.
There are daruma kushikatsu and takoyaki kukuru, so there seems to be no problem drinking it. When I tried to order daruma around 930, I was told that I could only order alcohol and that food would be served after 1000.
I looked at the shops around me and it looked like I could order takoyaki, so I waited for 10 o'clock while eating takoyaki.
In the end, in addition to takoyaki, I ate kushikatsu, cutlet sandwich, and oyakodon oyakodon to finish off my meal, and I was completely full.
Everything was delicious and very satisfying. When you think of Osaka, you think of Kushikatsu!
Darumasan is a mustvisit place.
It's nice to be able to get off the Shinkansen and go straight to orgasm.
Here we have beer and kushikatsu and head to our destination.
The crunchy texture of the freshly fried kushikatsu and the oil may be due to the use of lard?No matter which skewer you eat, it has a slight pork taste that makes you addicted to it. The eatin area was very small, so I ate while huddled with the person next to me.
However, the kushikatsu was very delicious.
I received oysters and shrimp as an addition to the set. You can have it quickly before boarding the Shinkansen.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 9:30 PM

I googled and saw this small eatery. I ordered green curry, basil chicken I gobbled this up and forgot to take a pic first  and tom yum soup. They were all so delicious that I could cry  and most importantly very spicy. The restaurant also had chili condiments which were rare in most Japanese restaurants. I helped myself with the spicy condiments and my stomach was full and warmed by the spicyness. This shop literally saved me lol Only suggestion is for this shop to add Thai iced tea to the menu and this shop will flourish. A nice Thai restaurant in Umeda area. The khao man gai was delicious. Chicken was tender, especially when I poured the ginger sauce. Fried chicken version has less chicken for some reasons.
In winter there is pad thai that also tastes great with chicken from khao man gai.

The place is not large. Accept most payment methods including IC cards Good chicken and sauces, and decent portions for 900 yen. The rice is very bland, however. Not your usual chicken stock  ginger garlic rice that comes with Thai chicken rice. It was just plain white rice.

Overall  good in a pinch. Would be great if the rice had some flavor, but the location, price, and atmosphere make up for it. Mango Tree in Umekita is a great little Thai restaurant. Staff are friendly, though service is far from great at busy times. There's usually a wait, so you may queue for a long time.
The food is however is really good! Really taste Thai chicken over rice. I recommend the boiled chicken over the fried chicken. Goes really well with the sauces they provide. I wish I took a picture. Cost performance is great!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

We were craving good Pakistani food and this place dis not let us down. Big selection of dishes. We tried butter chicken, Muton karahi, BBQ platter and Biryani and they were all delicious. The staff was super friendly and we had a long chat after the meal with them. Amazing food by Amazing people. We will be back again for more. For the food, the aroma of the rice, the taste of mutton and chicken are very good and tasty. The service of the staff cashiercookermanager are well presented friendly and the atmosphere is very welcoming. I am a Bangladeshi who traveled to Japan and wanted to find Halal restaurants for my meals.

I found Dojima Mughal from Google maps. I was not expecting much but I was blown away when I tried their Mutton biryani, white tikka kabab, chicken tikka and mixed salad. It was super delicious!

I have to thank the chef as he helped me choose their best items.

The only downside for me was that I had trouble finding the restaurant as it was located underground.

Service 55
Location  45
Food  105 We were a group of 11 people. 9 from Bangladesh and 2 from Japan. We were on a business trip so it was important that our guests have some halal food for dinner.

We found this place with google maps and was unsure if the food was good as it was important to us that our guests have a great dinner.

Surprisingly, the food was delicious. Our guests praised the chef's cooking a lot. Our japanese guests also liked the foods as all the items had the right amount of spices to suit their taste buds.

The chef's, hospitality was top notch as well. He helped us understand the menu and order the right amount of food for our group.

The food that I liked the most mutton biryani, white chicken tikka and mixed salad. Nice little Halal Pakistani restaurant. I ordered a vegetable curry and nan bread which were very good. The curry was well spiced and was good value for money. The people who worked there were very pleasant and efficient.
The waiter went through the English menu and helpfully explained all the options available. Good value for money. Recommended.
TOP TIP the entrance is down a staircase to the left of the entrance to MacDonalds. Its in an underground shopping centre.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Takoyaki Wanaka Namba,"3-chōme-7-24 Namba, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0076, Japan",4.1,34.666293,135.5012918,"There were quite a number of shops selling the famous Takoyaki. But this one stands out and caught the attention as it was touted as a Michelin Guide awardee. You can either dine in or do a takeaway away. Well it really tasted different and good. The value for money is unbeatable 850 yen for 12 takoyakis! They are served hot, very flavorful with the sauce, and have the perfect texture, both melting and chewy from the octopus. Visited Takoyaki Wanaka, a place highly recommended by a local friend as his favorite spot for takoyaki in the city. It's a chain, so there are several locations in Osaka, making it convenient to find one near you. We chose the one closest to our hotel and weren't disappointed.

We arrived about half an hour before closing and were fortunate to snag one of the last few orders of the daythey close up once they sell out, which can be a few minutes before the official closing time. So, it's wise to arrive a bit early and be prepared for a possible wait.

We opted for the 8takoyaki set, which allows you to sample four different flavors. It was a delicious introduction to this iconic Osaka street food. Highly recommend stopping by Takoyaki Wanaka for a genuine taste of local cuisine! Ordered 8 plain Takoyaki as a pre dinner snack, and it was very flavoursome and piping hot. There was a long queue when I first walked past, so I didn't join the queue but made a mental note. When I walked past it again, the queue was much shorter so I decided to buy some. Takoyaki seems to be everywhere in Osaka, and I've never been a big fan, but this one is quite yummy. Tried as it's one ot the local specialties but it's not really my favourite dish. So for my own taste I would give a 3, but I assume if you'd like this type of food that this would be a good stall to eat it.

Balls are quite bland, the toppings really give the taste to all of it.

Osaka Station City,"3-chōme-1-3 Umeda, Kita Ward, Osaka, 530-0001, Japan",4.0,34.702411,135.495917,"Osaka Station, located within the shopping complex of Osaka Station City, is the biggest and busiest station in Western Japan.

Like its neighbour Kyoto station 29 mins train ride away, Osaka station offers plentiful facilities and services to tourists and locals. The station is well liked by people as a great recreation and entertainment haven.

The station itself has North Gate building and South Gate Building which are linked at ground floor by the station concourse. There are department stores, restaurants and many recreational facilities in both buildings. If you stay in nearby hotels, then you dont need to venture out  to any other area like Namba or Dontonbori for a huge and convenient shopping spree.

You can go between the two buildings via two bridges on 3rd floor and 5th floor respectively. If you are a train enthusiast, then go to these two bridges and watch the trains coming and going on the rail tracks below.

We spent a beautiful morning at the North Gate Building which is a 28 stories tall premises. Popular  department stores like Lucua my favourite store and Isetan are located in this building. Shop till you faint. There are also a cinema, a fitness club and offices in this building complex as well.

First we went up to the Tokinohiroba Plaza on the 5th floor of Osaka Station City. There is a bridge, decorated with 2 large clocks  one is gold and the other is silver in color.  If you can get some snack like spaghetti, pizza, lasagna etc from the Caffe Bar Del Sole here on 5th floor.  From this floor you can also see the train tracks and platforms below.

We continued to visit the 10th floor of the North Gate Building.
There we found a traditional Japanese style garden called Yawaraginoniwa Garden the meaning is peaceful garden. We saw many people enjoying the fresh air and warm sunlight peacefully whilst we were amused by the stunning city view calmly.

Then we continued our exploration by going up an outside staircase to the Kazenohiroba Plaza on 11th floor.  Kazenohiroba means garden of the wind.   The plaza is quite true to its name because it is a long and breezy garden. However this garden is famous for its multiple and colorful fragrant flowers. A lady gardener was carefully tending the flowers and plants while we were there. She was really really focus on tending of the gorgeous flowers see photos. Many young kids were playing joyfully at the water feature garden next to the flowers garden.

There is a Tenkunonoen Farm heavenly plantation located on 14th floor. It is a small rooftop farm 3 floors above the Kazenohiroba Plaza. Well the name is really appropriate for this plantation! Why? Let me tell you. We would love to see the plantation, but we have to walk up an almost 70 degree angled long flight of stairs. When I looked up the long stairs I felt as if I were going up to heaven.I made 3 attempts but my legs went jelly and could not move so finally I gave up. For some unknown reasons, I felt the staircases were  built in a scary straight angle at least to me. I have climbed 12000 ft mountain in Tibet but it did not make me feel scary as I faced  this only 3 floors high staircases. Unfortunately  I chickened out after trying several attempts otherwise I would have taken some nice photos of the plantation to share with you here. All I know from my research is that  a small vineyard and local vegetables herbs and fruits are planted in the plantation.  Anyway I saw the same gardener from the 11th floor garden walked up elegantly and relaxingly up the stairway to heaven shortly after I quit walking up the stairs.

Last but not least lets explore the South Gate Building. You can find Daimaru department store and Hotel Granvia and Taiyonohiroba Plaza plant of the sun.

I find that all the big train stations such as Kyoto, Tokyo and Osaka stations have provided many great entertainment and recreational facilities for people to enjoy and explore. An incredible indoor shopping malltype experience that seems to offer virtually everything you could think of buying.  It is, however, a bit daunting for newcomers who are going to spend some time figuring out where  everything you are looking for is located. Very confusing when you first arrive but when you get used to it, it's ok. Lots of stuff including an underground supermarket called Eki Marche and food stores to fill up time before catching your train. Place is easy to navigate as the layout is quite straightforward. Just follow the signboards if you're not sure where to go.

Loft store name is also large, there were stationary and make up things like lip tints and so on. Including Ghibli store there are many kinds of character stores. I recommend IZUMO eel don restaurant, workers are nice food were lovely. The food selection on the B2 floor has so many delicious things that I spent about 30 minutes and couldnt decide what to buy for dinner. There is an area where you can buy the takeout and eat it there. They have a washbasins, a microwave and many tables to sit down. So while other restaurants around are closed at 9 PM, you can still order food here. They even give discount for some food around 8 PM. Shopping mall within the perimeters of Osaka Rail Station. More premium brands on display including local brands to feast your eyes upon. 7 floors of shopping til you drop as you browse through floor by floor of various fashion wear and accessories. Easy to navigate around as it isn't too big within each floor. This was a pretty nice shopping center. Had many floors to go up to get to the sushi place I had found in google to eat at but that was ok. I did appreciate the little smoking room on the same level of the restaurant as I popped in there to puff on my vape for a couple minutes while I waited for the sushi place to let me in to be seated. I didnt do any shopping but I did look around a bit and it seemed very nice, clean and well organized. If I had more time I would have went and looked around each floor more extensively. Really enjoyed the bottom floor of the LUCUA mall as a jewelry and perfume lover. They called this area Isetan Urban Market and had many boutiques of local brands or Japanese made brands.

This place is great if youre into niche interests such as this. I was able to buy high quality gold plated to gold fill jewelry and some very softgentle fragrances. 2040each.

The 2nd to top floors had lots of premium cosmetics, clothing and other items however I felt they were a bit expensive like 100 . Still very beautiful mall and worth walking around!","Monday: 10:30 AM – 8:30 PM

I went to discover the sweets and it turns out it was one of my favorite places in Osaka.
The price was ok  it wasnt cheap but not too expensive. Bustling places with a lot of people to buy something. When you visit the food court in this place at around 7 PM, which is an hour prior to the closing time, you'll be able to get a special discount offermore than 20, generally up to 50 for many food, including dumpling, sushi, pudding, Japanese dessert, and more. The feeling I have for Japan is that I can't see, feel enough for so many things, people, and their culture.
It's pity now there's overtourism every where in Japan, I feel sorry for that. In the meantime enjoy all the nice things in Japan, I hope they will not one day raise up the bar high to block some bad quality tourist...... But again maybe that's not a bad idea. .
Hope to visit Osaka again soon. Hankyu Umeda Main Store is a premier shopping destination in Osaka, known for its excellent accessibility and diverse offerings.

Located above Hankyu Umeda Station, it features 15 floors filled with luxury brands, cosmetics, gourmet food, and lifestyle products.

The store is particularly popular for its ""DepaBasement Gourmet"" food hall, showcasing exquisite food displays and a variety of dining options.

Additionally, it provides convenient services for international visitors, including taxfree shopping, free WiFi, and hotel delivery, making it a mustvisit for both locals and tourists.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

While it may not be as large or bustling as some other shopping malls in Osaka, it offered a more intimate and relaxed atmosphere. We would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the area.
Consider that air conditioning system is not good enough here! Bright and cherry place with a food court that is perfectly situated near two of the most kidfriendly attractions in Osaka Lego and Kaiyukan! Plaza designed for kids, good for family travel if you got plan to the acqurium. But need to take note that there're no big lockers for suitcase inside the shopping mall. Crowded and without tax free shops even though many tourists. Disappointed as we would have shopped more with tax free. Thank you for maintaining a clean shopping experience.

4. Sumo statue seems to be like their signature also route check when you want to go there. Not sure about the actual plaza area however the cafe  dinner downstairs is very bad. We walked in to a not so busy restaurant at the time and werent even acknowledged by the 3 waitresses that walked past us.

The menu looked good for breakfast but I guess well never know. Out of the places that I have visited in japan this would have to be the most disappointing ever.

Highly recommended Large mall with many shops in a convenient location. It is right next to a subway line! If you buy food here there are tables outside, next to the river, which is a great place to relax and have a snack. Large shopping mall with everything you need from households, phones, TVs and electronics, toys, gifts to clothing, snacks, traditional Japanese goods and computers including your favourite security software.

The top floor offers high quality dinning and a golf training academy service. Looks nice but we did not shop. On our way to the subway.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

We first got lost in the whiteys underground shopping city. We found an entrance right outside the station after we found the trippy elephant statues lol we got there early so places were just opening up. It's
Like a multi floor mall  indoor swap meet in some sections. We did shop around a little, grabbed a quick snack an made our way over to Shinsaibashisuji  Dotonbori afterwards via a short inexpensive Taxi ride to avoid the crowded buses. The driver was super helpful and gave us some local insight  recommendations  Good underground shopping center. A little old and hard to navigate but lots of good shops and convenient exits, too. The fountain area is great to meet up with people and has seasonal displays that are pretty ridiculous and fun. In warmer seasons, the fountain runs like a normal fountain. When you wonder where everyone is during the day, theyre all in Whity underground mall  its another world. Street filled with food stores and shops. Nothing spectacular, unless your in the area. I would not come here if it was out of the way. This underground shopping mall is so vast that you will be surprised to find yourself getting lost.

What's even more surprising is that even this underground shopping mall is only a small part of Umeda's entire underground shopping mall.

A small history room about the Osaka Castle is on the ground floor. A great place to explore when you visit the Osaka Castle. This building also has an interesting history in the area and now houses several souvenir shops, cafes, restaurants and public facilities.

In the heat of the summer, this place is air condition and a good place to come in and cool down. There's also a mini museum with the complete history of the Osaka Castle. There's also a few water machine here. Just on the path towards Osaka castle. Nice place to take a break to get a drink, lunch or shipping.

There were many antenna shops from each prefecture!
It's fun just looking at the unique assortment of products.
There were a variety of restaurants, from unique restaurants to wellknown restaurants.
There are some stores that are opening in Kansai for the first time, so it's nice to visit various stores
There were some shops that weren't that expensive even though they were in prime locations. Since it had only recently opened, there were a large number of customers.
This time we mainly visited the second floor, where antenna shops from all over the country are gathered.
First, I went to Miwa Yamamoto's directly managed store in Nara Prefecture, the birthplace of handstretched somen noodles.There were products I had never seen before, such as instant somen noodles that you just pour hot water on. There were also many other products that are not normally available at antenna shops in Hiroshima and Wakayama.
On the way to shopping, I stopped at JP Cafe and ordered a craft cola, but it didn't really suit my taste.
Since I only had a limited time this time, I wasn't able to see everything, but I'm sure there were a lot of products I'd never seen before, so I'd definitely go back again. I went there for the first time in August 2014. Even after opening, I was surprised to see so many people there. It was easy to get to as it was right next to the JR West Exit. There are so many antenna shops and restaurants that choosing one can be difficult. There are many restaurants and antenna shops such as Kagoshimaya, Izumoya, and Satosa.
The toilets are also clean. There is also a theater and mailbox, which is cute.",no operation time,"shopping_mall, point_of_interest, establishment"

The place was that of former Osaka Central Post, this is why named following the Japaner pronouciation of post stamp.
So interesting and eyeopening construction as it is at the beginning, similar with Kyoto station, people will be bored sooner or later. Nothing interestiong was found inspite of hiexpectations.

There were no shops like this around here, so it was a relief.
Dr. Reform is open from 930 a.m. to 630 p.m., except on days Seni City is closed and during the yearend and New Year holidays.
Sen'i City itself has declined considerably compared to what it used to be, but there are still some clothingrelated shops operating here.
Also, Daikoku Drug recently entered the market. When I heard that it had been renovated, I went there for the first time in a while and it didn't look like it used to. The number of stores has decreased considerably, with most stores catering to elderly people. I watched it while feeling the flow of the times. About 45 years ago, when I was in junior high school, I went fishing because I wanted a transformation suit, a combat uniform, or a jumper suit...I ate standing at Mikuni Soba...At that time, Sen'i City was a great textile town''. There were also a lot of clothes shops that looked like they were unscrupulous...The ones that were used by bad boys at the time...Clothes shops that were frequented by Teru from Joto, like Parion'' from Bebop...There were a lot of cutlets hiding in the shadows...People were being targeted. There were two of us...so I remember being prepared when we went... The futon store Daishin has a wide variety of products and is a very friendly shop.

Core shopping building act III

This is a fun building with lots of shops that people like!

Desk Union is a used record shop where you can buy core records.

DADA, a secondhand clothing store for women with outstanding taste

There are many other shops that are perfect for subculture lovers.

A store that I personally have been going to for a long time is
Desk Union

When I was a record collector,
I found a lot of bargain records at this store, and it became my sacred place 

It's been a long time since I've been here, and I was very moved to see that they're still alive and well in this era of digital shift and vinyl records being in decline. It had an atmosphere that was a bit difficult to get into, and although I had recognized it for a long time, I just walked past it. When I entered the building, I saw that it was an ordinary building with many restaurants and other shops. The location isn't bad, so I'll look around to see if there's a good store. It was a little dark, but the two restaurants serving lunch were busy.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Contains hotels and restaurants. There are various shops, and I was satisfied with the place to eat!  I thought that in Osaka they would be more concerned about quality, but they were influenced in the opposite direction and turned out to be a bad restaurant, comparable to Bgrade gourmet food. The toppings are flimsy and come in a plastic bag for delivery.
The staff's hands are all oily from touching the food, and the smell is so bad that I can't eat it.
The tuna in particular is very good, and I've used it twice for delivery, but this time I took another bite and it all went straight into the trash.At least Kura Sushi's food is better.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

All the staff members serve customers cheerfully. There is no need to force it. It's fun to watch as the items change every two weeks. They have a good selection of leather products. The shop channel is targeted at women, so it is difficult for men to get into it, but it is an outlet that offers products with packaging and other problems at low prices.
Clothes samples are quite cheap, and depending on your timing, you can make some great purchases!
The staff's response is also good  I sometimes take a look. Once a year? I once purchased a large amount of chairs and storage items at an event sale at the plaza. I don't really watch the Shop Channel broadcasts anymore, but it's a valuable place where you can get your hands on the actual product. Although it's not surprisingly cheap because it's already expensive, it's also a place where you can check the size before purchasing online. It varies depending on the manufacturer. They only have some products, but they sometimes have Bgrade products, so I check them out when I'm nearby.
It's a shame that the location is a little inconvenient even though it's in Umeda. It was on the corner of Third Avenue. It was new to me because I didn't know about it. After all, I think shopping like this is fun because I see it on TV. The clerk is nice o","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Last year, there weren't many events held and I felt lonely, but recently when I looked at them, there were a lot of them held on weekends 

This time, I painted Van Gogh's View of SainteMarie''. Its really difficult 
However, by actually drawing, you will realize the greatness of Van Gogh. You'll never understand this just by looking at it 
I also thought Van Gogh's color choices were cute.

However, I have been painting since middle school
This time, the teacher Mr. Aki wrote a draft so that it could be finished in two hours.
So all that was left was to color itI was planning on doing it. . . 
It's not that easy 

The teacher was very easy to talk to, and I felt like we were friends, so I enjoyed spending time with him.
By the way, the reason for the 4 stars is that 2 hours is not enough.
I started drawing it a long time ago, so I wish I had continued to do it for a longer period of time.
The teacher said it was okay if I stayed longer, but if I went along with that, I would probably stay for 3 or 4 hoursI had time after about 2 hours

But I wanted to draw again, so I made an appointment right away 
Personally, I would be happy if the event was held on weekdays too I'd love to take a detour on my way home from work

By the way, it's great because you can go emptyhanded 
No paints or aprons needed 
While drawing, there will be wine, soft drinks, and snacks, so you can draw while half drunk 

Paintings are 5,500 yen per person.
I think it was 7,700 yen per person to drop paint. Even though I am an amateur who can't draw while eating alcohol and sweets, I was able to draw a very good picture! The instructors are amazing I had a private charter with my wife and my friend, and we had a great time drinking together in the morning  It was a really fun time and I learned so much from you!","Monday: Closed

I strongly recommend the Adidas store in Shinsaibashi! Professional, courteous and friendly! I tried to exchange for a size but the staff was very rude and angrily told me he cannot change without shoes box , I told him I didnt receive box he said he will check video and still decided to not approve exchange . He had no care at all . Came to grab a pair of shoes. Great service! People like Takashi are wonderful ambassadors for Japan. He was incredibly helpful and polite today when I purchased some shoes and other items. I had to end up going back 3 times due to my fault and he was helpful and patient on each occasion. He also very kindly researched a great coffee location for me, which didnt disappoint. Thats 5 star service. Love your country and love people like Takashi  The service here is the best.

Ladder was in the way but the staff made no attempt to move it to clear the way. They seemed more interested in chatting with their regular customers instead. The female staff tried to be nice but the male one seemed to lack the ability to do so. I ended up leaving without buying anything, not that it bothered them. Excellent shop with products of the highest quality.  The staff were friendly and very helpful! Fortunately, I was able to purchase DSB 1001XX. I also purchased laundry detergent, and the staff was kind and the store was clean. The lower floor is a warehouse and the upper floor is made up of denim. Recommended. The male staff is really friendly.
I was looking at 4601 tshirts, and he asked me about my size and brought me all the tshirts in sizes that fit me.
You can also hear a brief explanation about the shrinkage rate and fabric after washing.
4601 I only bought one pocket tshirt, but if I could afford it, I would have liked to buy a printed tshirt as well.
However, you cannot try on the Tshirt and it is not taxfree. If you're looking for real American casual, this is definitely the placeI went to the sample sale this summer as well. I bought two Tshirts.","Monday: 12:00 – 7:00 PM

There is no flow from the moment you enter. No logical layout compared to the other big stores in Umeda.
The ESL and EFL selection of books has also greatly diminished from several years ago. They carried very few publishers and didn't carry more than a copy or two in stock. Won't be going back there!

At the time of shopping, there was a promotion with a gachapon machine. I tried my luck and got an extra 5 for the bag.

You will eventually get hungry or end up buying things you didnt know youd wanted to buy.

Caution ! Dont go when youre hungry. Youll be broke  Tax refund was a nightmare even though it was organize . I wanted to queue for my wife when she is in the toilet and coming up .

But the person does not allow me to queue for her . Saying the person who queue must be the one who receive the tax refund .

I have visited many shopping and mall worldwide and This is the first time I heard of this . The rules are not flexible .

The person is not able to show me the exact clause or rules stating this at first and pass me some leaflet to show me . I question her that there is no such clause printed .

. Until eventually she found something look at attachment near the queue . I Believe the conditions can be more flexible .

Only the lady slightly senior with shoulder hair  can speak English . The other are not able to speak English .

The lady attitude can definitely be improved . This is not a typical Japanese attitude . Was a bit disappointed.

1. The bookstore and stationary area is difficult to find, and there is no a dedicated personal that his job is to assist with finding the right book and stationary. I asked the cashier, and she was very kind to provide me with an assistant.

2. Difficult to find nice casual clothes for men. Almost all clothes are for women. The store is big. I ended up annoyed finding a shirt to buy.

3. At some floor, there are two tearoom, but despite the name, there is only one kind of tea to order earl gray. And the tearoom was in felt relatively neglected that requires to be renovated and more attention. I tried one of them. maybe the other one is good, i didnt try it.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

We just came back from Japan for our honeymoon last month. We shopped at Hanshin to buy some souvenirs to take home before our flight later that day. So we bought these Mt Fuji chopsticks, but when we got back to the US and unwrapped them, we realized they gave us the wrong ones. So I rang the department store, found someone who spoke English and told her what happened and asked how we can get the Mt Fuji chopsticks even if need to pay for them. They emailed us a couple of days later to say they will send us the set and will let us to keep the existing set. We received them today by express post from Japan. i felt so emotional by looking at these beautiful chopsticks because I was extremely upset that the wrong set of chopsticks were given to us and for me to only realize it after we flew back. The team was apologetic and communitive. I am so impressed by your dedication for customer service and you go above and beyond to showcase your customer obssession! Thank you so much again for sending us the chopsticks, you made our trip extra special. These chopsticks will remind us the beautiful country we visited and the kindest people we met along the way.  Japan, you are truly special! And Hanshin, we will be back again to visit your beautiful store!! So many delicious food! Good place for people who want to buy souvenirs, too B1 1F are all the food gift  a must place to visit. We went back another 3 times to buy the biscuit. Even when we moved to Kyoto. This review for Hanshin food hall.

We visited during the matcha  tea fair. Which we noticed from their Instagram account. Worth a lot of time because they curated a good matcha shop from Kyoto, Osaka and many more. I was surprised because some shop were a rare find.

So we got to try everything in one place! Really enjoyable to walk around. They arranged the standing space with table for eat in. Really convenient.

Also stop by at their bakery space, variety of selections. It is quite sufficient for brand lovers. Remember brands for man is in a separated building! If you go shopping with family members, there are plenty of facilities for playing and eating.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

And i really love shopping Kintetsu Main department store  dining at Harukas So when you are in Osaka, Come  visit Kintetsu Not good brands to shop, elevators are a headache be ready to patiently wait at least 20 minutes to get on one, because two were out of service, tax return is super slow and overall the shopping experience is quite poor. Would never recommend to spend time here unless you need something urgently and youre right in front of it. They close too early at 800 PM Actually I came to this departmental store to buy engrave chopstick for my relative. Relatively more expensive compare those I saw at Higashiyama area. This place is more for the local. Tourist then to get lost as there are too many floors. Great place so many things to see ","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

The atmosphere is pleasant, making it a fun place to explore. Whether youre looking for a snack, a new outfit, or just browsing for unique items, this department store offers a delightful experience. Actually not department store, just supermarket or a little bit larger. It doesnt mean bad, handy size is enough good for daily life. Wide range of shopping selections and friendly environment for shoppers. I went to Ramen Kaeoh, located downstairs at the Kintetsu Higashiosaka store next to Fuse Station. You can choose the type of noodles, firmness, amount of sauce, etc., and it's delicious. Hanepari gyoza and fried chicken are also good lol Due to the coronavirus pandemic, ordering is done via touch panel. There is also a selfcheckout system, and it is very quiet for a ramen restaurant. The department store directly under the guardrail connected to Kintetsu Fuse Station looks like a large downtown shopping districtThe 551 Horai Wagon store is opening there like a store. . .

Its the perfect place to explore, shop, and snack your way through the day. And if you havent tried the pistachio shake at the dessert shop, youre missing out! Absolutely worth the visitjust be ready to order one for yourself, no sharing allowed!  Underground shopping at its best! This place covers 3 floors of shopping and food  and we felt that the vibes here aee much better compared to the Namba underground shopping. So much to see or shop, so many choices of food! Can't believe we didn't explore this place in our earlier trips to Osaka. Overall a very satisfying outing here. Comfortable to take a bus to the airport. There is an area with air conditioning that you can sit. The airport bus comes every 1015 mins. This a underground arcade full of small cafes, restaurants and shops under the Hankyu Umeda train station.
The cafe Roma, serves a range of spaghetti dishes at a reasonable price. There is a mix of high counter and table seating. Service is quick. Picture menu. Awesome stores located here. But can be at two different building as they are not linked. This is also a bus terminal and train station so there are many people around. Its very crowded!

LOFT Umeda,"16-7 Chayamachi, Kita Ward, Osaka, 530-0013, Japan",3.9,34.7080631,135.4999925,"I love LOFT since I first chanced upon it in Tokyo. Its a departmental store with fashion, kitchen, beauty segments.

A great place to shop for souvenirs imo! I recommend the Shupatto reusable bags as theyre big when opened and flat when folded. I used to think SGD1120 is too expensive for a shopping bag but Ive already bought a small and medium size for myself and 34 more for friends.

The way the goods were displayed were very attractive to me! I love nice crockery and kitchenware and bought some items for myself and my friends.

Theres also a huge beauty section with various make up and skincare products on level 2.

TAX FREE FOR TOURISTS Check with staff or read posters regarding the minimum spending  I believe it is 5,000 yen. Once youve made payment at the various levels, present the receipts and items at the taxfree counters at level 4 for taxfree refund.

Just a tip, some people mentioned the staff are slow. Do hold some items and receipts in your hands. I was standing in queue and there were some idle staff but the moment I took my items and receipts out to prepare as I wa next in line, a staff swiftly offered me a basket and processed my items.

As usual, these will be packed in the taxfree transparent plastic packaging that you are not supposed to open until you leave Japan. Hence, if you need to strategize how you want them packed, pls inform the staff. A total of 8 floors and definitely one of the largest LOFT in Osaka.

There are wide variety of items from stationaries to household items and many more. Spend almost half of the day here to browse and shop. The items are all neatly organised and categorised which improves the shopping experience.

Love the store staff too as they are all friendly and helpful.

Will surely return to shop here! Nice shop if and only if you are not shopping taxfree! Tax refund procedure was a hell. First of all we had to pay at the cash register including tax, then you must line up again at the tax refund counter for half an hour. Then the procedure started with two persons, the one had to fill in some form on paper and the other one had to check if everything was done correctly. After then we had to wait for more than 30 minutes before every step was taken correctly by the staff. Then we discovered that we had to pay around 14 handling fee. A great place for shopping. Very good selection. Loft's staff was kind, courteous, and attentive.
The store was fairly clean, and the staff did a good job of attending to foreigners needs as best they could, though I did not personally need such assistance.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM

They have a fantastic selection of Rimowa luggage options. Whether you're looking for something stylish or functional, there's plenty to choose from. The store is always lively and offers so many unique products. Highly recommend visiting! Donquijotes are great. Good place to kill time at 5 am when you have jet lag lol. It's too bad that the elevator in this one isn't usable right  now. Looks like they're fixing something, so your way is blocked if you try leaving the elevator on the 3rd floor. They don't allowencourage strollers up the escalator either. You can still get a good amount of shopping done on the first floor alone How ever,as how as another reviewers back down. I felt the same when I was there to shop. As a traveler I bought goods there and paid with my tourist visa for free taxes. An old Japanese lady gave me a wear look. I saw another Vietnamese works arubaito  there and gossiped something. Really wear and not polite at all! Definitely the worse experience in Japan. Literally no customer service inside the shop. You can easily find same products with lower prices in those drugstore inside the metro station. Can you even imagine in Japan when you go to the cashier, they dont even say hi? Eventually we returned the products havent opened the whole tax free package which initially they said no, BUT, when we asked for the official document just to demonstrate the consumer law, they said ok you can return them all. Definitely the dark side of Japan tourism specially here in Osaka. Worst shopping experience EVER in Japan. Bad customer service, mean attitude, didnt wanna help customer to find goods I wanted. Check out procedures were blunt. The cashier was a robotlike without customer care service. PLEASE VISIT OTHER BRANCHES!","Monday: Open 24 hours

The female clerk straight up yelled at everyone because apparently the 2nd floor is kids section only. She kept yelling at everyone without listening to reasons. Everyone just walked out frustrated.

We travelled to Japan many times and never been yelled at any store for any reason.

Something is fundamentally wrong with the staff here. This store completely destroyed the ZARA brand for us. Do Not Visit! The fitting room assistant girl is very rude.
When I gave her back unnecessary items, she told me put myself to the rack inside. Nice store very rude workers. This lady was very rude while my girlfriend was checking out and I was sitting by waiting Store is fine just met a very rude staff hence I give a 1 star for bad experiences.

This store occupies 3 stories of the building.  Floors 10 12.  Tax return is done at the 10th floor.

Its the same building where Pokemon Store and Nintendo store are at so you can leave the family there and get some metime exploring Hands. Nice place to visit for all sorts or merchandise. This outlet has a few levels, and sells a variety of goods, including stationery, back and knee braces, seats with back support, electronics, household items, toiletries and office essentials. We spent a bit of time browsing at some of the novel items.

Shop is clean and bright. It is located in Daimaru Osaka station. Sell lots of interesting stationary, stickers, handcraft, cosmetics, kitchenware and bathroom accessories. This is a perfect store for strolling around in and indulge yourself in the vast varieties of Japanese merchandise.

If you plan to buy some sweet souvenirs, you should consider visiting this place instead of buying them at the drugstores around. It will be a little cheaper and you have a way larger selection.

Once we got inside, a sales person came over and introduced herself. We explained what we were looking for we had a few different items we were interested in and she was very accommodating. She brought us the items we were looking for if they had it, and then was more than happy to show us other items we asked about.
Overall a great experience.

Also, I had no idea that this is the largest LV store in Japan. Its a beautiful store inside and out. Looking forward to visiting again. We came to this LV store on a rainy day but there was still a long queue to get through. After around 20 minutes, we were assisted by 2 staffs. One was miss Oishi and sorry I forgot the other ones name. They were both so supportive and friendly, trying their best to communicate in English with us. We even asked them for food spots recommendations lol.
The store offered a great selection of products. New collection pieces were on display.
The packaging process was a bit slow due to some problems with the engraving machine we were the last customers to leave. However, we still left with satisfaction and got what we wanted! I visited the Louis Vuitton Osaka flagship store with high expectations, but unfortunately, it failed to impress. Compared to the stunning Singapore store, the Osaka building was a letdown. The exterior design, inspired by traditional Japanese cargo ships, fell flat for me. While the concept is interesting, the execution didn't quite work.

Upon entering, I found the interior to be surprisingly plain and lacking the luxury feel I've come to associate with Louis Vuitton. The nautical theme continues inside, with wooden floors and metal ceilings, but it didn't wow me. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I left feeling unimpressed.

While the staff were friendly and helpful, the store's architecture and design didn't meet my expectations. If you're a diehard Louis Vuitton fan, you might still want to visit, but for me, it was a disappointment. We enjoyed our experience at Louis Vuitton. My son was looking for a custom bracelet and he found exactly what he was looking for. The service was impeccable as always and we would recommend the experience. Pro tip A line forms to get into this location, which can be quite long, so be sure to plan your visit accordingly. Ayaka HORII served us and we had the best experience.

We came back multiple times and made 2 purchases on 2 different days.

She was very patient. Ive seen reviews on other people that they were mislead or urged to buy stuff and this was not the case at all.

She was always waiting for us at the entrance, just brilliant and always punctual and adaptable.

Ayaka took pride in her work and allowed us to explore all product ranges and customisable options.

I also wanted to try on some clothes and she accommodated that very quickly and she didnt question it at all.

Great store, Great cafe, and a great buying experience. We were offered comfortable seats and water during the buying process and leaving the store had a great structured etiquette and routine.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Even though the items I wanted were sold out, but I still had a very enjoyable experience. After I had a bad shopping experience in Sacai  Store, CDG had better customer service. a middle age male salesperson are professional and love to helpanswer all my concern.

They had three or four options at 5000 yen they did not have the sleeve design separated from what I was looking for. I also believe they had no zipper on the short. Colors available are black with thin stripes, also a navy blueindigo color.
 was helpful. We did not speak Japanese, we are thankful the younger lady helped us with the transaction. This spot was perfect for grabbing food, and entrance is not too busy. ! I was looking for a jinbei in Kyoto but the prices were insane. Luckily I found this shop in google and managed to get two jinbeis here. The couples were really nice and know some english. The shop has been selling Japanese souvenirs for almost 75 years. They managed to sort out my jinbei dilemma as well. I highly recommend for anyone whos looking to buy japanese souvenirs here because prices are quite reasonable. I visited here twice, once when I lived in Osaka, and a second time a year later on vacation. Each time, they were super friendly and polite, and made the experience extremely memorable! Many of the uniforms they have in stock are the standard traditional cooking attire, but unlike many of the other uniform stores in Osaka, they also stock a large amount of independent designs made by the young woman who runs the place! If you ever wanted to equip yourself with the stylings of a Japanese chef, support a local artist, and get a good deal on top of it all, I 100 recommend this place!!!!!

I purchased 4 traditional aprons for me and some friends, as well as a cooking apron, chef hat, and 2 bandanas. Each one was perfectly sized, and built to last! The aprons have seen steady use for over a year straight, and look just as sturdy as the day I got them! The shop has nice and cheap clothes, especially aprons. They also have original design aprons which look really nice. The owners are really nice and friendly.
They will help you find the right product for you.
The shop looks a little bit old, but is well organized and has nice goods.
They accept credit cards like visa and cash of course. This little shop is owned and run by a local elderly couple that are an absolute pleasure to deal with.  I found this hidden jem looking for jinbei traditional pajamas. The little old lady helped me find everything I needed, she knew my size just looking at me!

The prices are really reasonable and I definitely recommend them!","Monday: 10:30 AM – 6:30 PM

At first, she wanted something she saw online, but she liked the necklace recommended by the store the best.
I bought two, and I would like to thank the female clerk who recommended them to me.

I've been wearing it ever since.
It was a satisfying purchase. Thank you to the onsite staff for their enthusiastic and warm hospitality. They provided detailed introductions to various products. The staff from Taiwan and local Japanese staff tirelessly assisted us in finding suitable items, sharing product designs and concepts, creating a highly professional atmosphere .

Although we didn't find the perfect wallet, we ended up purchasing a uniquely styled leather wallet as a gift for our family. Despite this, it was a delightful shopping experience, leaving us with a lasting impression of the brand. Exceptional sales service not only boosts sales but also significantly enhances the company's image. Thank you for making our afternoon enjoyable.

Thanks to the onsite service staff for their warm and cordial hospitality and detailed introduction to various products. The local store clerks from Taiwan and Japan took the trouble to help us find suitable products and shared product designs and concepts, which made people feel very professional.

Although we still haven't found a suitable long wallet, we bought a beeshaped wallet as a gift for my family, hoping that it would be as diligent as a bee. But it was a very pleasant shopping experience and we were very impressed with the brand. Excellent sales and service personnel can not only increase sales, but also greatly enhance the company's image. Thank you for a lovely afternoon. 326 I heard that it is good to buy a wallet on the strongest day of the year, which is the Year of the Tiger, the Day of the Tiger, and the Day of the Tiger. I was planning to go to Osaka on this day to buy a wallet, so I made a reservation in advance and had a great shopping experience at GUCCI in Osaka Takashimaya. Above all, the advisor staff that helped me was wonderful! First of all, even though it was later than the scheduled time, they had great customer service and explained the products to me, and I was able to try them out.Afterwards, I went to a Yakiniku restaurant in the area. I was planning to go there, but I didn't know where it was, so when I went to see the staff member who was in charge of it, she did her best to look it up on her smartphone, and then went outside to see me off outside Takashimaya. He even told me how to get to the yakiniku restaurant and even gave the shopper a plastic bag. She had a very nice smile and was one of the nicest clerks I've seen in a brand store, the store was nice, the products were exactly as described, and I liked everything about it. I went to the store with my Korean boyfriend, and my Korean boyfriend also said that the Japanese staff were very polite, provided good service, and were kind.Japan is the best. , he praised me. It was a memorable shopping trip, and it was all thanks to the staff who took care of it. All the staff in the store were nice, and the atmosphere inside the store was nice. Another thing I often think about is that the staff at GUCCI are really nice. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Okumoto, the advisor staff member who was in charge of this project. Please continue to do your best with the advisor staff who are worthy of the GUCCI name! ! I would like to purchase from here again. Thank you! !   I went shopping around 7pm on April 12th. My wife's wallet and my key case were falling apart, so I bought a new one.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

I'm surprised that there are people like that even among department store clerks.
I don't really want to say this, but I was wondering about him as a person.
I hope it will be improved. The tallest female clerk is the worst!
If you don't want to sell, close your shop or take a vacation.  The tall, curlyhaired man has a meek attitude and seems to want to answer the question. Should the company deal with it? Look like you are sick. If you are sick, go home and rest quickly. Don't care about people's complaints. Customers will be in a bad mood when they see you! Very bad shopping experience, bad staff ruins the brand image. The person in charge of me was probably new to the store, so I was surprised by the highpressure language from the other employees.
Is this a problem with The North Face as a whole, with employees talking loudly to each other during the cash register?

They sell all kinds of cosmetics, so I think it's convenient for women.

There are also other popular clothing items, a variety of sweets, drinks, frozen foods, and a coffee stand, so although the store is compact, I personally felt that it was a very fulfilling store. This store is next to the airport limousine bus stop. Therefore, the target audience is tourists.
The first floor has food, sweets, drinks, cosmetics, etc. The 2nd floor has accessories, clothing, underwear, etc. that can be used for traveling.
The first floor is an atrium, so the ceiling is high and there is an open feeling.
Not all items are available, so if you want to see a variety of items, it's better to go to other stores Grand Front, Hanshin Department Store.

Staff is very helpful and friendly. They are able to speak English as well. Very satisfied with my purchase !  Official Porter in Osaka Porter Exchange PX tanker specialty store.

The bag was all broken so it was a bit inconvenient to take it out and I had to take it all out one by one. It feels like it was organized for interior design rather than a display for customers. It's for display purposes, so if you ask, many products are out of stock. Still, the display is really cool! It felt like I was inside an army tent!

There are many tankoriented products and various types, so you can choose according to your preference. There are more details than the regular Porter models, so the price feels a bit higher.

Because it is not part of Daimaru Department Store, there was no 5 discount, and only a tax refund was received! Happy to get it!!!!  I finally found an allnew tanker... They say it's the last green one on sale. Even considering that it is the most expensive model with two zip lines, the price is too high 83,000 yen taxfree. Other than the fact that the zipper opens and closes more smoothly and an internal pocket has been added, there are no significant changes from the existing model. The staff was really friendly and it was nice to know what I wanted in detail. There are many new versions of tanker products.

I purchased a pair of sneakers and with her help every process was easy and flawless. Thanks Chihiro! The only thing they have to improve on is acknowledging customers when customers first walk in. At least five people walked by me without saying a simple hi or ill be right there with you, and as I was just about to get frustrated someone connected me with Ms. Chihiro. Other than that, loved the selection at the store and loved everything about my purchase! Miss is very kind.Even if I am a Taiwanese,she communiactes with me patiently in English.After I decide to buy military messenger bag,she also carefully check the details of the bag. I think this is an awesome shopping experience.
 I'm glad to be able to purchase the puzzle I wanted here, even though I'm a foreigner. saAyumi Takai was very attentive in answering my questions. I was planning to buy a fragrance, but I was surprised by the poor attitude 
I guess they thought I was a customer who wasn't buying anything, but they just sprinkled the fragrance I requested on Muette, and although there were no other customers, I didn't seem to want to serve them. I will never go there again  I bought a puzzle tote. I buy from DAIMARU and Hankyu Department Store Umeda Sannomiya from time to time without worrying about which shop, but they seem to have a history, and even though I only buy from time to time, they always treat me kindly. I liked the atmosphere because it was easy to watch and easy to get into. I will use them again.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Saturday at 5pm was the wrong time to visit!

Very helpful and friendly staff. amazing clothes that seem oneofakind. I found the clothes to be quite different from the Kyoto store and it was worth the adventure. It's on the top floor of the department store, split into two different stores at each end of the hallway. Staff was very helpful! Happy with the items I picked up. They have staff more than customers but not allowed customers to go inside  Never boring with Kapital, always intriguing to see what is next I went to this store last week. It was just before closing time. I asked the staff to help me find clothes in Size Large and XL. For about the next hour the brought me almost every large sized item they had in the store. It was such a cool experience. I ended up buying a few items. I would certainly reccomend checking this store out.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Unfortunately, the store doesnt carry many cute colors for their luxury look. I was hoping to get a luggage to match my Samsonite work bag which is an autumn brownish orange color. The woman working at the counter was respectful and kind. She answered my question about colors promptly. Great service at Samsonite. We purchased a luggage and the staff was able to arrange for next day delivery to our hotel room. 2024.04.13 Pass here
The store has a textured style.
We walked in and took a look at the luggage for boarding. After choosing for a long time, we asked a lot of questions. The store clerk was very kind and patient. They didn't treat us differently just because we are foreigners. Thank you very much for their service.
I love the last carryon suitcase I purchased! Thank you for your kind and courteous customer service for a long time.
After all, Samsonite is my only choice for suitcases. Our manufacturing and commitment are different from other manufacturers.
I didn't end up purchasing it this time because I didn't have the color I liked, but I will buy it someday.
I was reassured that I could repair old items that I use carefully. It was the first time I went in and asked to see if I had not purchased anything. The clerk was still very polite and thanked me.
Take a look at it the same night or come back to buy it
Pretty good shopping experience
Chinese is different, but simple English is acceptable
Basically do things carefully
Big push

But I had a few seasons of their stuffs. They r durable and value for money. Unlike porter, they did not go global, hence retaining their cost competitiveness. They uses gortex and all the best materials in the market for their products. My shoulder sling bag lasted for 13 years before retiring. While the bag selection was a bit smaller than I expected, the store has other items like apparel and shoes as well. It seems their main competitor Y P has been rising globally and so their prices have gone up a lot  MSPC bags are great value in comparison with basically the same quality.

She was happy to show me all the  bags that I want to look and offered others for me to choose. I couldn't decide on the first day so she gave me a business card in case I came back to buy one. The next day I went to another branch in Osaka where the service was very bad. Finally, I came back to buy a bag at this branch with the same staff who took care of me. Even though they didn't have the bag that I wanted but I got a another new collection handbag and a mini wallet. I was very impressed. Next time I'll come back again. Worst customer service ever, SA dont even bother to check for stocks when I asked for other colors. When I agreed to buy the bag, she only shared that they left with display bag which is full of scratches and rushing me to pay before 7.30pm just because she needs to go home? Please beware of SA starts with the name of   cause she is definitely the worst. Horrible attitude. Treated me with such passive aggression just because I spoke Chinese? Told me everything I wanted was out of stock which is hard to believe, it made me wonder if they were just trying to gatekeep the bag from me. Store clerk here is not helpful. Asked to see what earrings were available and he brought 1 tray out. Asked if there might be more, he hesitated to bring another. Asked if theres anymore, and he brought a 3rd tray out. Should have been more proactive. Seemed like he wasnt interested to serve or made a judgement that I wouldnt be a potential buyer. I picked out a pair from one of the trays as the prices were favorable due to the falling yen.
Otherwise, would prefer to purchase from Bkk airport where service is impeccable. Racism. Keep you out of the door. No service. The store was empty and we watched for 10 minutes and no one came in to tell us that the reservation was full, no reservations allowed and no reservations today.

MAISON GOYARD OSAKA HANKYU UMEDA,"Japan, 〒530-8350 Osaka, Kita Ward, Kakudachō, 8−７ 阪急百貨店 阪急うめだ本店 2階",2.4,34.7022315,135.4986084,"I want to buy a gift for my wife and we dont have specific model to look for, so we 1st go to Namba br. as its not far from our stay. No que and we are the only cutomer in the store but SA a little Japanese guy seems like dont wanna service us he answer only what u ask luckily there is no item we like. So we head to Umeda br. but not expect to get one as it is weekend with crowded people at this area. A bit wait for 4 que 1015 mins. We are finally in the store and my wife find sth. she like. SA is very nice to us. We are from Thailand and SA has visited Thailand for several times and he plans to visit Thailand again very soon. So talking chitchat is very smooth along with the service. So I am very happy to get my wife her 1st Goyard as a birthday gift and you can tell from her smile. That smile make my day.  I recently purchased a Goyard St. Louis PM bag, and unfortunately, my experience has been disappointing. Shortly after purchasing, I noticed that both top handles started peeling off. To make matters worse, I discovered additional defects on other parts of the handles.

I reached out to the company's aftersales service team, but since I live outside their service country, addressing these issues has been incredibly inconvenient. I requested a replacement instead of a repair, as traveling multiple times to drop off and pick up the product is not feasible for me. However, I was informed that only a repair is possible, which will take at least two months.

This experience has left me frustrated and disappointed. I hope the company can improve its quality control and aftersales support, especially for international customers. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this product. Visited on a Saturday afternoon and there was quite a line but it moved quickly. I enter in 20minutes unfortunately both Osaka stores dont have the regular St. Louis just the one with a heart painted. Prices are very similar to Europe. Staff was attentive and fast. From the moment I stepped into Goyard Osaka, I was greeted with the utmost courtesy and politeness that one could expect from a luxury boutique. The contrast was stark compared to my previous visit to Goyard Kyoto, where the service did not quite meet my expectations.

In Osaka, the staff went above and beyond to ensure that every customer felt valued. One employee, in particular, made a lasting impression as they gracefully navigated through the queue, attentively inquiring about each customer's needs and preferences. This proactive approach to customer service made the shopping experience personal and enjoyable.

While the boutique's selection was somewhat limited, with a few items out of stock and a narrower range of colors than anticipated, the exceptional service more than compensated for this minor inconvenience. The team's dedication to customer satisfaction shone brightly, making my visit to Goyard Osaka a memorable one.

I would highly recommend Goyard Osaka over to anyone seeking not just a product, but a delightful shopping experience. The staff's commitment to excellence is evident, and it's clear that they are the cornerstone of the boutique's charm. The staff at Kyoto should learn how to treat their customers better. We could directly see that the staff had put away additional stock in a separate cupboard, and given that it was large quantities of the exact same product, it was clearly not for display purposes. However, the store clerk denied its existence and refused to sell us the products that we clearly saw was still in stock.

Furthermore, the male staff had shown a non display product to the group next to us for their considerations, but even when they ultimately decided not to buy it, he refused to let us have a chance to purchase it.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

In the summer, this place serves as a great place to cool down from the hot summer heat. There's also a cafe, food kiosk, toilets and an exhibition area inside here. This shop has a good selection of gifts and souvenirs. In particular, I liked the tshirts and magnets on offer here. A spectacular castle set in Parklands. Food and drinks available nearby. Just a moderate walk from a JR station on the circle line. Some stairs are involved but if necessary an elevator is available. Just Drinks  snacks but not recommended if U r not really Hungry.

There is also a store in the Tenjinbashisuji shopping street, but this one has wide aisles that allow you to walk around more comfortably. I'm glad that you can easily find delicious Okinawan souvenirs such as root beer, island tofu, sea grapes, and chinsuko in Osaka. Here you can find things that could only be bought in Okinawa! It's about 20 more expensive than the local price, but they even have Lloyd's items that you won't find in other Okinawa shops  We also have two types of Nuchimasu salt tomatoes. You don't have to look around for it, it's all here!

I want to eat brown sugar chocolate soon, but I have to restock it lol It's only available a few times a year for a limited time, so I have to call before going. This is one of the few Okinawa shops in Kansai.
I think the selection is quite small compared to Washita Shop in Tokyo, but they have a wide variety of products, from awamori, koregusu, and sanpin tea to shisa figurines and Ryukyu glasses.
Speaking of Okinawa, they had mozuku, but they also had kimchi mozuku! It's a rare item that can't be seen in Honshu, and it's very interesting.
Also, it's great that it's within walking distance from Umeda and Osaka stations!
Although the price is higher than buying it in Okinawa Prefecture, there are various products that will make you feel like you are in Okinawa, so just looking at it will make you feel like you are in Okinawa  They sell Orion beer Tshirts, brown sugar, Sanpin tea, Habu sake, Okinawaonly retort curry, seaweed, and sea grapes, so I often go here 
I was told that brown sugar tastes different depending on the island where it is made, so I compared the tastes and found that Honma was different
I love Nanshikowa! If you go to Umeda, definitely go there! LOL
Of course, they also sell awamori, so you can buy Okinawan things here without having to go all the way to Okinawa! Laughter
If you want to go to Okinawa but can't get there
If you come to this shop, you might be able to recharge your batteries...
The store staff are also kind and polite! Osaka Umeda Links Okinawa products exhibition on the 1st basement floor.
Im grateful that I can buy Zanpa bottlescans without going to Okinawa ","Monday: 9:30 AM – 10:00 PM

The store is clean and tidy, with products arranged for easy viewing. In addition, the cashier service is quick so that you can shop smoothly even if you have a short Shinkansen transfer time. Especially for busy businessmen and travelers, being able to purchase souvenirs efficiently is a great benefit.

You can easily find great souvenirs. Its something in the middle of the Obon Day of the Dead weekend to see the hundreds of travelers buying cakes of all kinds to bring to their families. It's bustling and we don't understand all these little cakes but we would love a tasting  The products were neatly displayed and I was able to pay at the cash register smoothly.
I bought hojicha jelly from a longestablished store in Kyoto, and the jelly was refreshing and went great with the red bean paste. It's lively and sells all kinds of souvenirs!
There are also items outside of Osaka Kyoto, Hyogo.
Even though it was a normal Saturday and Sunday, which is not the busy season, I was surprised to see that they were doing sales and tastings.
It was a sight that you don't see in Tokyo or Nagoya, and I thought it was very Osaka. It's crowded with people buying souvenirs.
There are local specialties from the Kansai area.
It is a popular store along with 551!
Depending on the item, you can receive a small bag as a souvenir.

Exit the Kintetsu Namba Station ticket gate and go straight ahead, and the store will be on the left.
They also sold cute miscellaneous goods and bottled orange juice.
I would like to use it again when I come to Minami.

I enjoyed it slowly.
Souvenirs are collaboration items with various characters.
It was fun just looking at the store, where you could buy souvenirs from Osaka just like you would normally.
As someone who was born in the Showa era, there were some nostalgic brand items and I was having fun lol.
I have other plans for this day.

I came to see Namba Kagetsu and thought I'd like to stop by.
Still, I bought it. It's so crowded before and after the theater that you can't go shopping. There will also be long lines at the register.

There are many types of alcohol that I'd like to try, but I can't buy them because they'll be in my luggage...I'd like to buy them again when I get a chance.

Its ridiculous that I purchased a box of Tokyo Banana on 20240622 to have it expired on 20240624. And also charge full price?!! It is also almost 20 cheaper at the airport and also the Royce chocolate too.

The gentleman who was guarding the gift paper bags was also extremely rude. Requesting a paper bag for each gift box is not too much to ask. Isnt that why you are more expensive than the other store down the street from you? Good selection but can get a bit crowded.  Royce is a popular choice amongst tourists and can get sold out quite quickly. I bought NY Cheese and Tokyo Banana. Because I couldn't find it in other shops, when I found the shop is selling them, I rushed to get them here. However the items are more expensive than the other shops. Also I wonder why all the boxes and packaging are dirty. If you want to buy things for people as souvenier, I would say it is better to buy it from airport, is more hygienic and also with lower price. If you want to eat immediately, is okay to get it from here. Service mind is so bad!","Monday: 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Osaka trip 
I bought two types of Iwate's famous confectionery, Kamome's egg lemon and Aomori's apple juice. It was delicious This is an antenna shop in Aomori and Iwate prefectures located in Dojima, Osaka.
There are lots of delicious things.
There are a variety of delicacies such as highquality seafood pickles, strawberry stew, and sea squirt sashimi.
This time I bought something reasonably priced.
I'm grateful to be able to purchase it here as it reminds me of my previous trip to the Tohoku region. Antenna shop in Aomori and Iwate.
I went there 30 minutes before closing, but the store had started closing, so I felt like I was being rushed and couldn't take my time to choose. I love Aomori, and when I learned that there was an antenna shop in Osaka, I went there. I only looked in the store and didn't buy anything, but the staff didn't say a word when I entered or when I left. I think there were two people.

I don't know if the clerk is from Aomori, but people from Aomori have a reputation for not being as friendly as people from Osaka, but I didn't feel that way when I went to Aomori.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

If you're just heading towards the tower then follow the signs for ticketing and the elevator entrance! Lots of cute miscellaneous goods.
The price is also reasonable.
It's a souvenir zone, so you can buy things without going into Tsutenkaku.
It is unclear whether if you call out to the staff while queuing, they will let you through.

There are many products with motifs of various sweets.
Perfect as a souvenir.

There is also a restroom that is clean and easy to use. There were many local products such as Happy Turn and Kaki no Tane, as well as character goods such as Glico, Chicken Ramen, Kyorochan, and Chicochan. Waku Waku Land had Morinaga, Glico, and NISSIN shops.

Especially when it comes to Glico, back in the Showa era, Glico'' would have been synonymous with caramel.
Caramel has become a rare confectionery that is hard to sell these days.

I remembered that my grandfather had asked me to buy Glico caramel when I went to Osaka, so I stopped by.

If you want a souvenir with a Showa retro feel, we recommend Glico's caramel.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:30 PM

The limited time ""Mint Gaufre"" cherry blossom flavor cream with cherry blossoms was a great souvenir. When I arrived, I happened to have a coin set from the Jiachen Year. As soon as I entered the store, I was attracted by the dazzling array of products in front of me. From antique coins to modern collectibles, each item showcases the unique charm of Japanese currency. There are also many exquisite souvenirs, such as badges and stationery from the Mint Museum, etc. They all attract me with their exquisite craftsmanship and design.

Those antique coins. They are inspired by real currencies from Japanese history, recreating the culture and artistic style of the time. I saw a copper medallion modeled after Edo period currency, with traditional patterns and text engraved on it, and I was amazed at the sophistication and detail.

While shopping, I also had the opportunity to interact with store staff. They are very friendly and welcoming. They introduced me to some special items and answered all my questions, making my shopping experience even more enriching and enjoyable.

Finally, please note that this store is not taxfree and needs to pay 10 consumption tax, but for me, the items sold in this store are indeed a bit small. I am purchasing anniversary sets and viewing information on the products available at the internet store.
After enjoying a tour of the adjacent Mint Museum, taking quizzes, and experiencing weights, we entered the store to purchase souvenirs. I definitely want sweets! That's what I thought when I made mint rice crackers. I shared it with my family during snack time on the go and it was delicious. Individually wrapped, it was easy to say ""Yes, please!"" Anniversary sets are gifts for people whose birthdays are coming up. I bought commemorative medals for the families who showed me the way.
For those who like collecting coins or those visiting for sightseeing, I think the easytosee display makes the process of selecting and purchasing coins simple and easy to understand. There are many commemorative coins. They had rice crackers, so I bought them as souvenirs. Next time I'll come when it opens.
After commenting on this, I entered the store when it opened, and there were quite a lot of coins etc. Among the inexpensive items less than 1,000 yen, there were canned drops Sakuma? and rice crackers Kameido.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 4:30 PM
