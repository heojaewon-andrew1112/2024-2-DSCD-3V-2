Rockefeller Center,"45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10111, USA",4.7,40.7587402,-73.9786736,"I recently visited the Top of the Rock Observation Deck at Rockefeller Center, and it exceeded all my expectations! The panoramic views of Manhattan from the 70th floor were simply stunning. The stunning vistas of iconic landmarks like the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and Central Park left me awestruck.

The observation deck was spacious and wellorganized, making it easy to navigate and find the perfect spot to take in the views. The interactive exhibits and displays added a fascinating touch, providing insight into the city's history and architecture.

The staff were friendly and efficient, ensuring a seamless entry process. I appreciated the timedentry system, which prevented overcrowding and allowed for a relaxed experience.

Whether you're a local or a tourist, the Top of the Rock is a mustvisit attraction. I highly recommend it for its spectacular views, engaging exhibits, and unforgettable experience.

Each member of staff we encountered were polite and helpful, and the toilets are kept sparkling clean.

Empire State Building,"20 W 34th St., New York, NY 10001, USA",4.7,40.7484405,-73.9856644,"My visit to the Empire State Building was absolutely incredible! The process was smooth and efficienthaving purchased tickets in advance, I was able to skip the long lines and head straight in. The staff was friendly and guided us through each step. The museum artifact section was a fascinating way to learn about the buildings history and construction, with interactive exhibits and iconic memorabilia that really brought the story to life.

When we made it to the top, the views were breathtaking! You get a 360degree panorama of New York City that feels surreal, especially at sunset. It was an unforgettable experience, and Id highly recommend it to anyone visiting NYC. Definitely worth every penny! This architectural masterpiece is both historically significant and aesthetically captivating. The building is a magnificent addition to the New York City skyline, embodying a simplicity that is both elegant and aweinspiring. Visiting New York City has long been a dream of mine, and the moment I laid eyes on this skyscraper, that dream was fulfilled. I highly recommend it as an essential stop for anyone planning a trip to NYC. My visit to the Empire State Building was an unforgettable experience. From the moment I entered the iconic building, I was struck by its grandeur and historical significance. The Art Deco architecture is stunning, and the lobby itself is a sight to behold.
The elevator ride to the observation deck was smooth and quick, and the staff were friendly and efficient. Once at the top, the views were absolutely breathtaking. Seeing New York City from such a height is truly aweinspiring. The 360degree panorama allows you to take in all the major landmarks, from Central Park to the Statue of Liberty.
The exhibits on the way up were informative and added to the overall experience, providing interesting insights into the buildings history and construction. The binoculars on the observation deck were a fun addition, allowing for an even closer look at the citys details.
In summary, the Empire State Building is a mustvisit attraction in New York City. The combination of its historical charm, architectural beauty, and stunning views makes it an experience not to be missed. Simply iconic, having seen the sunset at the top of the Empire State was one of the most striking experiences I had and I have to come back someday! The path through the corridors and elevators was also very fun. The staff was very receptive and friendly. It should be noted that the sunset time is also the most crowded and the competition for good spots is very high. I really enjoyed the experience. It was fun. You could feel the energy and excitement from the other tourists and from the building itself. It was so incredible and unbelievable that men build this amazing building, but also s unfortunate so many lost their lives. I would recommend as it is an opportunity to see New York, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Philly...it's incredible!!","Monday: 9:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Times Square,"Manhattan, NY 10036, USA",4.7,40.7579747,-73.9855426,"What a fun and exciting place. The action never stops last night. It was beautiful. We got some great nighttime shots. Today was rainy and it was amazing to see all the different color umbrellas. Walking down the street and everybody still enjoying themselves. Even in the rain, this is a definitely must see. When you come to New York, you will have an amazing time. So many places to go to so many places to eat at tons of options. New York City's Time Square is magical  shouldn't be missed!  If you've never been, you should go at least once as the lights at night are magical!  Go for their midnight moments hour for their art time on all the ads, it's magnificent.  There is so much joy in one place, yes it's a tourist trap but the best kind to people watch. It was my first time visiting, and I was pleasantly surprised that it was so clean. I've heard horror stories. My husband and I went on a Saturday night and walked around for a while and then spent a couple of hours people watching. It felt very safe and was alot of fun! Can't wait to go back. It is lively with many tourists staying there. You can enjoy watching various performance shows around the city. For food, go down a side street and you'll find delicious Italian and Asian food. One of my favorite places to be during evenings when its all bright and lit up with crowds cheering. I love watching those big bright screens with moving images. People walking around with their loved ones, some buying from the street vendors. I quietly enjoy people bargaining with those roadside vendors who are selling copies of branded women bags. Its a fun place to be.",no operation time,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment"
Statue of Liberty,"New York, NY 10004, USA",4.7,40.6892494,-74.0445004,"Amazing experience! Perfect for families and created some unforgettable memories. Although weve visited NYC before, we never planned ahead enough to visit the Statue of Liberty. The Crown Tour requires advance planning  we booked our tickets two months ahead to ensure everything went smoothly, and it was worth every penny! Be ready to climb between 200500 stairs. We skipped the pedestal elevator and ended up walking the whole way. The spiral staircase leading to the crown is a real workout, so make sure to hydrate beforehand, especially since summer temperatures can get intense inside the statue. While the food is on the pricier side, its still good. The souvenirs and swag are also fantastic. Wed definitely do it again, but maybe in cooler weather next time! Located in New York Harbor off the southern tip of Manhattan, Liberty Island is best known as the site of the Statue of Liberty, one of the most iconic symbols of freedom and democracy in the world. It can only be reached by Statue City Cruise after leaving Ellis Island yesterday. The colossal neoclassical, copperclad sculpture was a gift from France to the United States as a token of goodwill for America's centennial of independence. The island is well kept and fairly small, but there is enough to see and do for at least a couple hours. Weve been here numerous times, and this time my partner, his aunt and I didnt arrange any special tickets to the pedestal or crown. The surroundings around Lady Liberty offered some amazing photos with views of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Jersey City. The museum offered a deep dive into the statues significance and the incredible craftsmanship that went into its creation. The exhibits were engaging and educational, highlighting the statues role as a symbol of democracy. It offered a lot of 11 reproductions that one can touch and interact with that truly give you a feeling of the scale of the statue. The digital wall was fun to do by taking your photo and watching as it appeared on the giant digital wall called Being Liberty. The overall experience was inspiring and educational. A mustsee for anyone visiting New York City, which we can recommend. Great experience. Family friendly and wonderful memories! We've been to NYC before but never planned ahead enough to do the statue. MUST PLAN AHEAD FOR THE CROWN TOUR!. We booked our tickets about 2 months in advance to make sure we had it done right. Well worth the money. Be prepared to climb 200500 stairs. We didn't wait for the pedestal elevator and ended up doing all the stairs. The spiral staircase to the crown is a workout so drink water ahead of time summer is hot under a giant copper lady's dress. Food is a bit pricey, but good. Great souvenirs and swag. Would do it again in cooler months for sure. The Statue of Liberty is truly a timeless symbol of freedom, offering an aweinspiring experience that goes beyond ordinary sightseeing. Approaching the monument by ferry, the sight of Lady Liberty towering majestically over the harbor is nothing short of breathtaking. The statues immense scale and intricate craftsmanship are remarkable, from the detailed folds of her robe to the iconic spikes of her crown.
The pedestal, which houses a museum, adds depth to the visit, providing rich historical context. It offers insights into the statue's creation, its powerful symbolism, and its important role in welcoming millions of immigrants to the United States.
Overall, it was a memorable experience that left a lasting impression. Finally up close and personal at the Statue of Liberty in New York City! The entire tour was exceptionally fun and educational. I encourage all visitors from around the world to include the Statue of Liberty tour in your itinerary. Either take the ferry from Manhattan or from Jersey! Explore the entire museum and you will learn so many things about Lady Liberty. Indeed fascinating and the experience will be forever remembered. If youre up for a challenge, take the stairs up and down. Dont worry, theres an elevator. If given another chance to be back, will sure am!","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:30 PM

Top of The Rock,"30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112, USA",4.7,40.7593495,-73.9794087,"This is hands down my favorite viewing platform in NYC! The first level offers a 360degree view behind glass, but the upper deck, accessible by stairs or elevator, is an open balcony with an even better viewideal for taking photos without the glass in the way. Its the perfect spot to look down at Central Park and admire the citys skyscrapers. However, it gets very crowded at sunset, with people arriving 1.5 to 2 hours early for a frontrow view. At other times, finding a spot is much easier. The only downside is the waitelevator service can be slow, and it typically takes 3545 minutes to get to the top and even longer to come down, which can be frustrating! We had an amazing time here and would highly recommend it to anyone considering visiting! We recently visited on a Friday evening just before sunset and caught the most spectacular views. The observation deck was busy, but there was still enough room to walk around and take unobstructed pictures. The weather was beautiful and the air was crisp. It can get windy up there but it's certainly refreshing on a hot day. Everything was clearly labeled making it easy to navigate, and there were friendly employees always nearby to tell you where to go  this was greatly appreciated. Your ticket will have a specific entry time on it, so just show up at that time to avoid waiting in line. We visited several observation decks during our NYC trip, and to our surprise, Top of The Rock was our best experience! Top of the Rock is a can'tmiss experience!  Even the journey up is an attraction in itself, with the operators getting super creative to make it memorable. By the time you reach the top, you're rewarded with a breathtaking view that truly shines, especially during sunset.  It's the perfect spot to soak in the stunning NYC skyline. If you're exploring New York, this is one place youve got to hit up at least once. Totally worth it!  Such a stunning view. Absolutely gorgeous view of the Empire State Building and Central Park which was spectacular. Visited at sunset and was in awe of how the skyline looked with a beautiful pink sky. Also done the beam which I would recommend. In comparison to the edge which I done two days later this was many times better in my opinion. Would love to go back next time I visit the city. So far the best rooftop observatory I have been in Manhattan, Views are incredible gorgeous, 3 floors of full of fun, a coffee shop and food was delicious and drinks were refreshing and tasty. I have to say that if you want the best view of Manhattan, Top of the rock is the perfect place. Building itself is an icon for New York.  Cant wait to come back again to this rooftop but now I will do the sunset time.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 12:00 AM

The Battery,"New York, NY 10004, USA",4.6,40.7029312,-74.0153603,"Simply an amazing trip.  Everything was amazing on this trip except our accommodations.  We had forgotten that some hotels are considered sanctuary hotels for the immigrants.  Our hotel wasn't but 2 close by were and they DO NOT sleep apparently.  Was up most the night due to noise outside An amazing park, and still under construction to make it even more special! We had a wonderful stroll in the park, stopping to take pictures of the Statue of Liberty in the distance. Enjoy this wonder! The park itself is pretty. But there are ticket sellers who force you to buy the ferry tickets. They wore authorized ticket seller vests, but they cat called women who walked by. Say mean things. Don't even answer them. Just keep walking. Hate those ticket sellers.
Also, the views for the Status of Liberty is all blocked by fences. Plenty of open lawn space for lounging or walking. There is a cool carousel and large playground here for the kids too. Beautiful view overlooking the water and we saw multiple lines for attractions I believe it was boat tours in the area. Battery Park, Manhattan, is an astounding and worldfamous park with such history, beauty, breathtaking and especially its people. While you're walking about enjoying the splendor catch a ferry to the State of Liberty Park! It's without a doubt one of the most amazing places in not only New York  but the world.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Central Park,"New York, NY, USA",4.8,40.7825547,-73.9655834,"The central park was really nice, it was impressive to walk in a park which is in the middle of the city. There were so many people picnicking, relaxing, exercise, and even doing online yoga classes, which was interesting to watch. The first thing was horses with carriage, which was the initial cost of 79 and 20 everything each ten minutes. The dogs were on leads and always so friendly. I love dogs  so for me ,this was a heaven. The water fountains are everywhere, so you can fill up your bottle or just drink directly for free. There are bicycle and running paths, though, so we need to be aware of not crossing their way. It was amazing to stay and walk around. I am definitely recommending everyone to visit. The girls are selling a cup of fruit for 5 dollars. It's freshly cut and delicious. Enjoy squirrels everywhere and don't forget to bring nuts  It has been many years since the last time I visited Central Park, so I didn't remember how lovely this place really was. I revisited this park this past weekend and enjoyed playing ""tourist"" in my own city.  If you don't feel like walking around like I did, you have the option for a pedicab tour or horse and carriage ride. They have plenty of places to check out like a visitor's center to get information, a carousel, a zoo, boat rentals, gift shops, playgrounds, mall, etc. While doing your own selfguided tour, there are QR codes to get an audio tour about the points of interest.  They also have several places around the park to get a bite to eat. But be forewarned...it can be a bit expensive so I suggest bringing your own drinks and snacks if you are planning on being here for a while. I didn't get a chance to really explore the entire park as this place is quite huge. There are a good amount of restrooms throughout the park and plenty of places to sit and rest. There are critters scurrying about, but I didn't see the ""rats"" that several other reviewers have mentioned.  The park is kept reasonably clean and seems safe during the day.  In my opinion, Central Park is a great place to get some exercise, explore, or just relax.  I will definitely visit again in the future the next time I want to play ""tourist"" again. My visit to Central Park was an absolutely wonderful experience. This iconic New York park is a true oasis in the heart of the city. As soon as I entered, I was greeted by lush greenery and breathtaking landscapes.
The paths are perfectly maintained and offer numerous opportunities for walking, jogging, or simply relaxing. I particularly enjoyed the lake, where you can rent rowboats for a romantic or family outing. The gardens, such as the Conservatory Garden, are beautifully landscaped and provide an ideal setting for rejuvenation.
The park is also rich in cultural and recreational activities. From street performers to art installations, theres always something interesting happening. The playgrounds and open spaces are perfect for families, and theres plenty of room for picnics and outdoor games.
In summary, Central Park is a mustvisit destination for anyone in New York. Its natural beauty, combined with the variety of activities available, makes it a perfect spot for a memorable day out. If you are in Manhattan and looking to ride a bike or jog or casually stroll, then this is the park for you. It is a very safe place during the daytime. You must do boating in the lake. Park is pretty big so be prepare to walk some distance. Park is a tourist paradise. I think this might be my first time writing a review for something other than food. Central Park is much larger than you can imagine, sprawling and full of life. What I loved the most were the benches with engraved messages. Each one tells its own little story and adds a personal touch to the parks charm. Its a perfect place to relax, explore, and take in the beauty of nature right in the middle of the city.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 1:00 AM

Brooklyn Bridge,"New York, NY 10038, USA",4.8,40.7060855,-73.9968643,"After a fun day of shopping, my brother and I decided to visit the iconic Brooklyn Bridge before our latenight flight back to India! I had been to Brooklyn 8 years ago, but for my brother, it was a firsttime experience, and it was absolutely breathtaking!

Perfect spot for those Instagramworthy photos, too!  An unforgettable part of any New York adventure. The Brooklyn Bridge is a nice landmark to visit if you have some time while in New York. The views of the city skyline and the river are great, especially if youre walking across, but be prepared for heavy crowds, especially during peak hours. Its a wellknown spot, but theres nothing particularly extraordinary about the experience beyond the historical significance and views. If youre into sightseeing, its worth a visit, but I wouldnt go out of my way if youre short on time. Still, its an iconic part of New York, so it can be worth checking off your list. The Brooklyn Bridge offers a scenic and memorable walk with stunning views of New York City's skyline and the East River. Perfect for photos and soaking in the vibrant atmosphere, its a mustvisit for anyone exploring the city.

The breeze was absolutely lovely, and if I had more time in the day, I would have just sat on a bench and enjoyed the shade of the trees and watched the boats go by on the water.

There's a beautiful view across the water. This is an overall very peaceful area to visit in busy new york. I've Never Been to the Rockefeller Park before,  it's quite a Sophisticated park. However, they're were a Whole Lot of joggers jogging in both directions,  they started to annoying me that I had to keep looking behind me to see if they were coming up to me  they were taking up space that it was hard to walk in peace.

It's super easy to get to, with wide paths for walking or biking, and the whole park has a really peaceful vibe. The open green spaces are perfect for laying out a blanket and having a picnic with friends or family.

SUMMIT One Vanderbilt,"45 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.6,40.752764,-73.9787461,"A Stunning Experience at the Summit

I recently had the pleasure of visiting Summit  One Vanderbilt in New York City, and I must say, its an incredible addition to the citys skyline and a fantastic alternative to the Empire State Building. While the Empire State Building is undoubtedly a classic mustsee, Summit One Vanderbilt offers a modern and immersive experience that is simply not to be missed.

The views from the various observatory levels are nothing short of breathtaking. Whether youre gazing out over the iconic skyline or admiring the intricate architectural details of the city below, every angle presents a stunning photo opportunity. I highly recommend visiting around sunset for that you have to buy in advance  tickets at 6PM.

For those who might be hesitant about heights, I can assure you that the elevator ride to the 91 to 93 floor is incredibly smooth and quickyou hardly even feel it!
The design of this space is so thoughtfully done that even the journey adds to the excitement rather than heightening anxiety.

However, I do want to mention that my visit coincided with quite a crowd. Even though our tickets were timed, it became noticeably overcrowded once we got inside. We had high hopes for a sunset view, but our area was packed with people snapping pictures, making it challenging to capture that ideal shot. It seemed some groups were content to linger by the windows, some seem to be camping sitting down for more than one hour.
I understand that these challenges come with a highly soughtafter attraction, especially during prime hours. I believe The Summit will find ways to improve the flow of visitors to enhance the experience for everyone. It's definitely fun but I doubt I'd ever go again. Wife and kids liked it but I don't feel like it was amazing. Paid for the photo package but photos didn't seem professional quality and my phone was as good or better. We went at night so might be why, they just aren't setup for good night photos. Day photos might be better. If you want to get some amazing pictures high up of the empire State building or NYC in general,I recommend it but the exhibits are okay. Expect long lines and waiting. Loved it!!! The views are extraordinary......not overcrowded even though there are lots of people. Great experience for any age..... with family, friends.....date night. If you want great photos of the NY skyline this is it....the backdrop is incredible. After the experience up by the bar ... The drinks are good and you can sit outside and just take it all in. I have to say for an that gets a lot of people It was very well organized.... I think the only downside is the wait prior to security check but the workers were all great and very informative. I'm just disappointed  I didn't keep my QR code to view the pics. Definitely recommend!!!! I am absolutely speechlessthis place is insanely beautiful! From the moment we arrived, I couldnt stop saying WOW!! We visited on a sunny, clear day, and the panoramic views of NYC were simply out of this world. The experience was nothing short of magical and I was so happy to be there! I would 100 visit againits truly a masterpiece in New York. Highly recommend! Summit One Vanderbilt is a mustvisit for anyone looking to experience New York City from a whole new perspective!  Located atop one of Manhattan's newest skyscrapers, this observation deck offers jawdropping, 360degree views of the iconic skyline. The experience is enhanced with immersive art installations and stunning reflective spaces that make your visit even more memorable.  Whether you're watching the sunset or taking in the city lights at night, it's a breathtaking sight. Perfect for both tourists and locals, Summit One Vanderbilt provides a fresh and exciting way to see the city. Dont miss out on this incredible experience when you're in NYC!

It's definitely bigger than you will expect it to be. Unfortunately, the fountains were not operating but it's still worth the visit to behold this beautiful structure. There was a lot of activity in the area the day we were there. Soccer games, volleyball, and people just having a picnic. Easy to get into the park. Adjacent to the National Tennis Center. A great place to visit and have a little picnic. There is plenty of space to spread out a towel and enjoy the nice view and breeze. Its got plenty of trees. Its also a great place to take a bike and ride around . If you are bringing kids its a good thing to bring a soccer ball or a football or even a volleyball, there is plenty of space to play there. And in the summer time by the globe they usually open up the sprinklers. Place is clean and have public restrooms. Plus if you forget to bring drinks? No problem. They have people selling drinks that doesnt cost too much. Very peaceful if you Wana decompress! Visit during the fall if you can it's quite the spectacle   easy free parking, no admission fee required Love to ride my bike here. I wish they would turn the water on though. Its so cute to see the tourists posing near the unisphere Amazing place to unwind . Took myself to this amazing park  was thrilled .

The High Line,"New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,40.7479925,-74.0047649,"The High Line tends to get quite busy, particularly during peak times, which can make it difficult to find a quiet moment or take in the views without interruption. However, its still a mustsee for both locals and visitors. Whether you're after a serene retreat or a scenic stroll, this thoughtfully designed park provides a charming experience amidst the city's hustle and bustle. I enjoy this spot as a place to get away from the city while still being in town. I usually go for a walk during off hours, from 6 pm to 11 pm. It's a relaxing space with very creative art, perfect for clearing your mind. I love the food area as there are many choices for refreshments or a quick bite. I also enjoy the artwork and admiring the amazing architecture. If you enjoy all of the above, it's definitely a place you would want to visit while in New York. Its always hard to pick your favorite moment from the high line. As a New Yorker, every few months I come by here and the park has different displays or ideas. Between the wall admiring infrastructure, people watching and enjoying some kind of art. The 2030 block walk is really fun to do with friends or family. Highly recommend it for any tourist coming into NYC, which also stems into little island or the piers downtown! Again just more beautiful sights to take in. There is bar and food options along the path, benches and chair for people to chill. Did not run into bathrooms but there is always bathrooms around the area, heavy commercial area on most exits of the walkway. Great walk for exercise and to experience nature in the city. Fabulous views all around. From city buildings to the tracks to the water. Walked from Hudson Yards to Chelsea market, but a section was closed so we took the stairs down and ended up just walking the rest of the way to Chelsea. But the part we did walk was fun. I recommend as a great NYC activity to do. Chelsea Market was really great too! Now the high line is an iconic New York walkway above the city. From an old railway into a walkway. Its a must go place to walk around and in between buildings and apartments. Give you a different perspective about NewYork city.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The Museum of Interesting Things (advance appt only),"Georgetown Plaza, 60 E 8th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.6,40.7305539,-73.9930526,"I was looking for something different to do with my young adult boys during a meet up in NYC and thought we would try The Museum of Interesting Things! It turned out to be less of a typical ""museum"" and more of an authentic NYC experience! I easily connected via email with the amazing host and historian extraordinaire, Denny and secured an appointment time. Upon entering, I knew we were in for a special treat. Denny presented us with many different objects from the 19th and 20th centuries, many related to film, sound and photography accompanied by the historical background and a chance to try out the objects ourselves! Denny is knowledgeable and personable, with a delightfully quirky sense of humor. If you are interested in going back in time, or a nostalgic trip down memory lane, don't miss this! My only regret is that we didn't have enough time to go through each item in his apartment! I saw some gems hiding in there! A unique and fun experience like no other!! Definitely worth a visit!! And if you can please consider going the speakeasies! We were in town for the circus speakeasy, got to play with some cool toys and watch amazing and fun circus films. The museum is hosted by and run by Denny who is very knowledgeable and welcoming! He gives a tour of a few antiques from his extensive collection and puts them in your hands! Very hands on, intimate, and fun experience! I learned so much and will definitely be back! What a small little gem. This is basically a private person's personal collection of old, vintage things covering music, photography and videography. You have to book in advance for a private showing of his stuff in his own private apartment. I went here with my 5 and 7 year old kids and both them and myself had a really great time.

Denny, the owner, is an animated man, telling the backstory and background of all the items he showed with lots of humor and energy. He interacted a lot with the kids and made them laugh  I can imagine his tours being popular at schools. We saw an early Edison cylinder phonograph got to hear it as well, various apparatuses to capture photos or view photos, a old camera obscura,  old projectors, flipbook like private movie watching devices, musical instruments, just really fascinating stuff. We all got to try these items ourselves and the roughly one hour tour ended with us even unboxing other things he recently ordered a photographpostcard of an old, giant calculator.

Truly fun experience. I have to come back without the kids to ask many more questions or come to the Sunday public speakeasy exhibitions. The Museum of Interesting Things was easily one of my top 5 favorite museum experiences of all time. Its set up in an apartment and not only is everything out in the open but Denny the person that runs the museum hands you stuff to touch and try out. When I visited, some of the incredible items included original Edison cylinders, an original 3D photo of Abraham Lincoln, a Nickelodeon that has been opened up so you can see the mechanism, the Hobbit game for Commodore 64, and time card machines made by IBM before they were IBM. And everything has a story. We even unboxed some new donations to the museum. Even for the items I was familiar with, I LOVED how he recounted the history of the items. Dennys charisma and passion for his work shines through. Why walk through a large museum devoid of personality where everything is behind plexiglass when you can experience the dynamicism of the Museum of Interesting things. 1110 amazing experience. Fantastic experience! Denny was such a friendly and knowledgeable and passionate host. A visit to this museum would be great for anyone hoping to learn interesting facts, spend a quirky afternoon with friends, have a fun activity for a date, or go on an educational family outing. Denny has such an amazing collection of items and the positive energy he radiates is contagious. He has so many interesting items to show and so many great stories to share!

The museum would be particularly exciting for those interested in the development of media technology.",no operation time,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment"

We had such a wonderful time here with our family. The sprawling lawn is perfect for kids to run around and burn off energy, while parents can relax on the grass or at one of the many tables and chairs scattered throughout the park.

We loved grabbing lunch from the nearby food kiosks and enjoying it in the park. There are so many great options for food and coffee surrounding the area.

The park's central location is incredibly convenient, with the New York Public Library right next door and several subway stations just steps away.

The park offers a variety of free activities and amenities that kept our whole family entertained. We particularly enjoyed the putting green and the carousel, which were big hits with the kids.

From the large green space to chairs and tables you can sit and have a coffee, the park gives you the needed rest and relaxation from the hustle and bustle of the city. There's also a lovely restaurant and cafe attached to the park where you can grab some drinks and food. On certain Mondays you can head to the park to watch a movie on a big screen and grab a quick snack and sit on the grass. Other days you can stop by to listen to live bands or plays going on.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM

The Museum of Modern Art,"11 W 53rd St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.6,40.7614327,-73.9776216,"What a collection! I absolutely love this place. There is so much to see and experience, so make sure to give yourself AT LEAST 4 hours to take in all they have to offer. Their collection is very impressive, and we really enjoyed seeing so many famous works of art. We also found some new artists that we like! Add this place to your NYC list! This is a great museum worth visiting in NYC. With so many museums, it is hard to choose which one you should check out if you are limited for time. This should definitely make your top 5. Lots of interesting exhibits and activities for patrons of all ages.

If you are around on 1st Fridays, there is an evening event from 4pm8pm. MoMA is an intriguing museum with an extensive collection, offering something for everyone. Despite the large number of visitors, the museum never feels overcrowded due to its size and numerous galleries, allowing for a comfortable viewing experience.

When it comes to the individual works of art, everyone will have their own unique interpretations, and its something best experienced personally.

As a whole, I highly recommend this museum to anyone visiting New York City. A must visit in NY! If you love modern art this place is for you!! I spent hours here ! Its so much to see and do . I was able to see Van Goghs Starry Nights. Based on previous reviews I wasnt sure if it would still be there but it was !! Also this place is 56 floors. I did not realize initially going ! That was quite a treat . Lot of modern art here from likes of Andy Warhol, Claude Monet water lilies huge panels did he spend his entire career on growing and getting water lilies right ?, Picasso , Frida, Jackson Pollock abstract paintings
Vincent Van Gogh Starry nights
You can easily sit down and admire paintings as long as needed
I would recommend to spend atleast 2 or 3 hours on different floors and the painting period is clearly called out. It makes easier to navigate so many masterclass paintings

Bethesda Terrace,"New York, NY 10024, USA",4.7,40.7739528,-73.9709657,"Exquisite promenade marked by walkways and water features. Choose to bike to Bethesda Terrace from Columbus circle. A nice change of scenery and away from the bustling streets of New York. There is a flurry of greenery around you, you can get a good view from the balcony above the fountain and lake. Wonderful spot. This place was featured in many movies such as Home Alone 2 and The Avengers. Really stunning architecture and very popular. Theres also restrooms but they are so short! It was a beautiful place to visit. The weather was great and it really allowed us to enjoy the view. It was nice to see the place that showed up in the cinema. Bring your walking shoes. If you don't want to, there's plenty of bicycle people and horse carriage and they can drop you off on top, and you just go down the stairs. If stairs aren't your thing, there's a side that you can take but it will take longer to get to the actual fountain. Either way, you will love this place. Peaceful and beautiful. Bethesda Terrace is one of my favorite places in Central Park, from its lovely scene, to its busy with life attractions every day at whatever hour! Its really an amazing time and a great place to catch a photo. My favorite thing about it is the outdoor dancing events that happen during the summer to fall time! This place of Central Park now has a new special place in my heart. Ive always walked Central Park but never went by Bethesda Terrace, I recently visited with my husband and it was the most beautiful area. From the boat house to the under passage across from the fountain.. all you could hear is lovely live music, families laughing, people picnicking. It is a hidden gem to bring a blanket and get lost in the nature of the city. My husband even got me a personalized poem from Poems by a stranger.

The Met is more than just a museum its an inspiring journey through humanitys greatest artistic achievements. Highly recommended! This is a great museum. One of the best you'll ever visit. I came for the Sleeping Beauties Exhibit at the Costume Institute. I waited a couple of hours to enter that, but was able to see the rest of the museum. I had a wonderful day here. Thanks to Quinton, who worked in the line to enter the Costume Institute. He was so helpful because the line was so long and the system of using the QR code to get notified of when to enter was new to me.  I thought I had lost my place, but he got me back on track and in line just in time to enter. Very friendly and professional. Crazy expansive and quite the hiking trail if you intend to view every nook and cranny of the museum. We managed a visit to maybe 75 of the rooms and only read the most interesting information plaques. This itself took three hours. Another visit will be necessary. The Met will cater to whatever art interest you have but we particularly loved the periodarchitecture room displays. Plus it is likely undefeated for statues if you find yourself looking for that. It was amazing. I haven't been in so long!
The best part for me was the fashion exhibit that they had and the dresses were so cool! It was so nice to see human creativity.
There is so much to look at. I'm sure we only looked at a fraction of what was in the museum.
The knights were super fun and I loved the paintings. You are able to buy tickets online. There was a long line to purchase tickets when we arrived on a Thursday. It's a pretty easy process to buy tickets online. The museum is huge. You would need a few whole days to take everything in. There is a food court and clean restrooms.

The building itself is quite lovely and a great size to see everything in a slow paced few hours. The exhibits were incredibly well curated  using multimedia and interactive screens in a super effective way. If you want to learn everything about N.Y.C. history  this is the place!!! Loved the show about classic New York films and the main historical timeline exhibit. It felt like every artifact was perfectly chosenrare for the era being described. Dont miss the dynamic maptimeline of immigration flows depicted by growing tree rings in the restorationconservation exhibit. Everyone working there seemed content as well! And a sweet cafe to boot. This place is great for thoughtful tourists and lifelong New Yorkers alike. Its educational, politically charged and emotional.  The 2 hour tour was like a fun condensed history lesson. The lady was amazingly knowledgeable and fun to listen to.

This history and art museum was founded in 1923 by Henry Collins Brown. Run by a private nonprofit organization.  Its originally housed in Gracie Mansion.  Joseph H. Freedlanders Georgian ColonialRevival design for the building in its current location started in 1929 and was completed in 1932. Museums collection contains approximately 1.5 million objects. If you live in New York City, I highly recommend you to visit the museum. Youre going to have many aha moments there. The museum uses quite creative way to tell the story. It was very fun to see and learn the history of New York City.
If you visit New York City, you might find interesting to know what makes New York City this unique.
After museum, we went to Central Park for a picnic and a nice walk. What a beautiful day!
P.S. My friend used the culture pass to get tickets. The Museum of the City of New York deserves a 5star rating! This museum offers a fascinating and comprehensive look at the city's history, culture, and development. The exhibits are wellcurated, engaging, and informative, providing deep insights into New York's past and present. The museum's modern and accessible design enhances the visitor experience, and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful.

Visited the Museum of the City of New York on a Sunday. Got the tickets online and went into the museum hassle free. Initially, I did not have many expectation on the quality of the exhibitions due to the small size, however i was proven wrong by the comprehensive exhibitions and films in the museum. I learnt so much about NYCs history. Really recommend to catch the short film on the history of NYC which is shown only at specific timings.

They have free concerts in the summer in the plaza by the vessel and there is some nice shaded seating around the perimeter too. Close to the highline and shopping and restaurants in the Hudson Yards and Edge observation deck. This is definitely a goto place if you are visiting NY! It's an extraordinary architecture.  I loved being there. The atmosphere was wonderful. There was music, people enjoying their afternoon. A wonderful sight in this busy city. This was one of my favorite places during my stay in Manhattan. I'm so thankful a friend recommended it.

I actually liked that it was closed so no one was walking on it. Made for some gorgeous pictures! You can still go right up to it, and they had a farmer's Market on Tuesday and Thursday plus a fun mural and nice tables and chairs in both the sun and the shade. One day there was even Jenga on one of the tables.

I was told that when it's open, you need to book your ticket months in advance. It's beautiful. The architecture is stunning. You have to get tickets pretty far in advance at the moment, so check their web site. Pay special attention to their Terms and Conditions which allow them to use your posted photos for free in their marketing without paying you. There is an elevator but only for people who are disabled. the Vessel is an architectural marvel that offers an unmatched experience. While the inability to go upstairs is unfortunate, the impact and significance of the structure cannot be diminished.

People from different backgrounds and cultures explore this place to have a once in a lifetime experience. You must enjoy the view from the glass ceiling as well enjoy the beautiful elevator virtual tour while climbing down the elevator. And most importantly, if you are a photo lover you will love this! This is such a romantic place I cant wait to be there again. Besides, make sure you have enough time and energy to keep some beautiful once in a lifetime memories. Enjoy the Edge! Thanks me later. Dont worry about the ticket price its 100 worth of my friend. We went here at 10 am. Had some issues with the ticket confirmation. But they were able to get it figured out with some basic information. Staff was good limited interaction. He mentioned that the site has had some temporary issues. This was definitely built as an observation deck and not a retro fit. The glass was ok. A little smaller than expected. It had some wonderful views. Very enjoyable. Fantastic observation platform with a great view over NY. We went there Wednesday afternoon with basically no waiting time, entry fee is included in the NY pass. The large, tilted glass surfaces make the experience even more special.

After we spent 30min on the observation deck we moved up to the bar for a drink and came back duringafter the sunset to take a few more photos. We finally got to go and check out the edge this week while in town for business and it was a fun experience. There was no wait to get up to the top, this was a Monday morning at 11 AM. The views were great of the city and highly recommend. I did think that the price to go up was a bit much. All in all its another great observation deck in New York City with a different view of the city. Would recommend to those coming to visit. Incredible view of the Big Apple! We went on a Saturday, September 14th, in the morning and had no wait to go up to the observation deck. It was very spacious and had great views. The glass floor adds an interesting twist! You can see all of New York City from up there, as well as the Statue of Liberty in the distance! It's worth the price of admission.

Summit Rock,"Central Park W, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.7,40.7831954,-73.9700393,"Visitors can journey up the south slopes carved stone stairs to enjoy the vista at the peak, sunbathe on the lawn, or sit at the stone amphitheater with views to the wooded slopes to the south and east.
Before the creation of Central Park, Summit Rock was a prominent feature in Seneca Village, the predominantly AfricanAmerican community that existed in the West 80s from 1825 to 1857.
The rock outcrop commanded views in all directions, including of Seneca Village and west to the Hudson River and beyond to the hills of New Jersey. You can still see the river though the corridor of 83rd Street. When Central Park was constructed, the elevation made it a natural place for designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux to build a carriage and pedestrian overlook. The small seating are next to summit rock is one of my favorite spots. Quiet. Peaceful. Great view of the surrounding architecture. Just a nice spot to sit and think Unfortunately the summer time is not good for view the sky line as the trees and vegetation blocks the view So cool visiting the highest part of this iconic park. Definitely recommend visiting. Five stars. Great quiet place in Central Park with views of adjacent areas, with great space for small gatherings.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 1:00 AM

One World Trade Center,"285 Fulton St, New York, NY 10007, USA",4.8,40.7127431,-74.0133795,"One World Trade Center, located at 285 Fulton St, stands as a powerful symbol of resilience and hope in New York City. The moment you approach the tower, its striking architecture commands attention, reaching skyward with elegance and strength. The glass facade reflects the skyline and surrounding area, creating a dynamic visual experience.

Inside, the One World Observatory offers breathtaking panoramic views that stretch for miles, allowing visitors to appreciate the city's vastness from a unique vantage point. The elevators provide a thrilling ascent, showcasing a multimedia journey through the history of New York.

The immersive exhibits at the observatory deepen your connection to the citys story and its journey of renewal. Whether you're visiting during the day for stunning views of landmarks or at sunset to witness the city bathed in golden light, the experience is truly unforgettable.

One World Trade Center not only represents architectural brilliance but also serves as a poignant reminder of resilience and unity. Its a mustvisit destination that leaves a lasting impression on all who experience its grandeur. We had the opportunity to visit the One World Trade Center as guests of the country. An unbelievable experience, taking the elevator up and witnessing the development of New York is something to behold. A great place to visit, I would recommend it to anyone visiting the state it's a must do. Went on a Saturday at 230 p.m. in October after visiting the 911 Memorial  Museum, which are next door. So it was very convenient to add this activity.

We paid 157 for my mom, myself  two daughters. Get the family pack option to save a good amount on tickets.

Get your tickets online in advance  skip the long line. We went through security  then headed right in no wait.

The elevator ride is super fast our ears popped. It shows a neat photographic history of New York as you ascend.

The view is amazing of course, being the tallest building in NY. But it's blocked by glass  all indoors. Tons of people, so getting a good picture is a little tricky but doable. You can see the statue of liberty, empire state building  even other states.

I would have liked a little more interactive experience  more info on landmarks that I'm seeing. For 15, you can rent a tablet that's interactive to learn more about the places you see. Maybe info on the walls about the landmarks would have been nice.

Overall, it's just ok for what you pay, but we did appreciate the opportunity to go into the tallest building. One visit is sufficient. Probably wouldn't return. We'll try a different observatory next time. I enjoyed Wilson tower in Chicago much more, as it's a museum on your way up  the views are more breathtaking. Great attraction, queues were not too bad and we arrived quite late in the morning. The elevator ride is an experience in itself. The views from the top are incredible and large enough not to feel crowded. The price is very reasonable compared to other attractions of this type I have been to. One World Trade Center is a powerful symbol of resilience and an architectural marvel. The building offers breathtaking views of New York City from the One World Observatory, which is an unforgettable experience. The area around the tower, including the 911 Memorial, is both moving and serene. It's a mustvisit for anyone looking to take in the significance and beauty of this landmark.",no operation time,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment"
The Ride NYC,"W 42nd St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.2,40.7572095,-73.989331,"Outstanding! It was raining cats  dogs and these 2 saved our afternoon. Amazing tour amazing show elements laughter singing dancing  great! Our fellow riders could have been more fun  else fine! Very entertaining! Absolutely worth it! What a fantastic experience!!!! We visited NYC on Sept 28th from ScrantonWilkes Barre PA and Scotty was one of our hostesses on The Ride. Leaves one wondering how many coincidences can happen in NYC.  You could say we were over the moon impressed with all the performers on and off the bus! It was a rainy day in NYC and it was beautiful still! I will be back to see the show again without the rain  Cant rate this high enough! A must we had the best time and witnessed a first. A kid projectile vomiting into a grate right in front of our very eyes that's the hardest we've laughed the whole trip!!! We loved the guides, Street performances, singing and roaring with laughter! Our guide felt like family, and was so funny!!! I wanted to try out this experience for myself after reading the conflicting reviews. Im so glad I did. I had such a great time. I do recommend The Ride. I found the street performers entertaining and the narrators on the bus informative and engaging. They will have you laughing from start to finish. Yes some of its a bit corny but, dad jokes aside, if you dont have fun its because you decided not to have fun. It is interactive which is part of the experience. The street performers were amazing! The Ride is just over an hour long and you stay onboard the whole time. There are no restrooms or restroom breaksstops. So, plan ahead. I purchased my ticket on the viator app but you can go to The Ride website or maybe save a few dollars on groupon. I had no trouble securing a reservation an hour or so prior to scheduled departure and had several options. I had read great comments on a Facebook ad that this was hilarious so we did it because it was included in our go city tickets.  Would never pay even half of the ticket price.  While it was a decent time it definitely isn't hysterical by any means. The skits on the road are not very funny the female singer near Central park the mic was way too loud blasting inside the bus. The other singers were not that loud.  The two comedians in the bus were fun and I would've rather just gone on a ride around the city with them just being like funny tour guides. They were actually funny maybe could've been hysterical if they didn't have to stop for the acts on the street",no operation time,"tourist_attraction, travel_agency, point_of_interest, establishment"
Pier 46 at Hudson River Park,"Hudson River Greenway, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.7,40.7341889,-74.011265,"lovey spot to eat some pizza and watch the sunset. very peaceful and nice escape from the city. get. a bite to go from anywhere in west village and bring it to pier 46 for a perfect chill evening. great for a walk or run too. nice with tables across the pier. Nice pier to check out strolling along Hudson River Park Absolutely stunning view during sun down, breath taking view of the water and the city across the water. Won't disappoint trust me. You can take a bike ride along the waters which in it self is beautiful. Cool hangout at the frying Pan on the Hudson. Food was O.K. for my taste buds. Better for first dates or group hangouts. I remember the way the Hudson river piers used to be a long time ago and the slow and steady progress that they went through. Even when they were rundown and had an ill repute, the piers were a draw to New Yorkers and visitors looking to escape the urban jungle that is Manhattan. Looking back, it seems that revelers thought that the piers were worth the risk, no matter how badly kept and dangerous they were. People still went, but at their own risk. After extensive restoration, the piers are now part of a series of small parks which are known collectively as the Hudson River park.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 1:00 AM

You can sit inside a glowing fish and it plays music which made it a magical experience. Go sit inside the fishes in the circle to also move up and down. Cute carousel for the kids. Tons of stuff to do around there. Cheap entertainment for the kiddos and the employees were very friendly. So much fun, the staff is actually the best! They will make you feel quite at home, actually helped them get a Praying mantis that wandered onto there out of the carousel,  Lines can get pretty long. Wait times up to 30 minutes or more the weather is good. The ride was just under 3 minutes from stay to finish when we last went. Tickets are very cheap though, only 6 per ticket, 12 months and under are free and must be in the lap of an adult, and the same goes for anyone under 42 inches. Tickets are only available for purchase at the venue. Great for any age  go alone or with others , it doesnt matter best time to go is in the evening when the sunlight goes down and the colors of the carousels are brighter  it is very affordable

Castle Clinton National Monument,"New York, NY 10004, USA",4.4,40.7034401,-74.0168023,"This is mostly just a place to pick up tickets to go to Liberty and Ellis Islands. Although 7.5 million people arrived here from 18551890 including some of my German ancestors, there are only a few relics around inside, and one room with displays, mysteriously most of them are information about other places in America. I thought there might be a place to look up the names of some ancestors who came through here, but no. This is the only genuine place to buy tickets to ferry for Statue of Liberty. To get to this place is literally a nightmare with all the Red Blue and Green dressed fraudsters holding walkie talkies and pretending to be authority to stop you from reaching this place. Dont believe them! They physically stop you from reaching this ticket counter and the city authorities do nothing about it. These fraudsters must be put behind bars for their bad practices. This is not even called a business, simple fraud. If you can reach this place then you have avoided a lot of fraud today. I have been here a few times now. Its quite an interesting place to visit. The castle has a lot of history, starting out as an island fort connected by a wooden bridge, to being landlocked in Battery Park. Its amazing how things have changed around it.
This is well worth doing. There is a lot of history here. There is also a small gift shop with very helpful staff. This circular sandstone fort is in Battery Park on the southern tip of Manhattan, also known as Castle Clinton or Castle Garden.

Built in 1808, this landmark had held the immigrants before Ellis Island in the 19th century and went on to serve as beer garden, exhibit hall, theater and reportedly, as an aquarium.

I often stop by when I'm in the area. It's centrally located in lower Manhattan. Today I'm here to catch the ferry to Liberty Island on my island hopping trip. Good place for the history lovers..

If you are going to Ellis Island and Statue Of Liberty then you would stop by this monument.

It has come great pictures depicting the history of the place.

Though the monument is small and only one room is accessible but you still will like it once you enter the monument.","Monday: 7:45 AM – 5:00 PM

Berlin Wall,"393 S End Ave, New York, NY 10280, USA",4.1,40.7117091,-74.0166011,"A single slab of the Berlin Wall. A piece of history that was worth checking out after visiting WTC memorial. I served in Berlin from 1990 to 1994 and had much higher expectation for this tribute.  A single slab of wall and it's missing the smoothed rounded crown at the top of the wall.  I believe this section was called ""Chickenlips.""  Could have been better.  At least 3 sections with all components to the wall.  If you are going to do it, do it right!!  For anyone who may visit Berlin, do not miss the 1.2km stretch of Berlin Wall at the East Side Gallery. Nestled within a small garden near the World Trade Centre site it is quite hard to find even with Maps pointing the way. It is an interesting relic of the times when western and eastern Germany were separated. It is completely out of context in New York and it is like they have no idea what to do with it apart from put it on display. There is no interpretation or signage. You only know what it is because Maps says it is and you can find mention on websites. An interesting piece of history definitely worth checking out if youre visiting the World Trade Center. Weird one to review. It's a nice little piece of the wall but it's kind of hidden away.

Love the no mow area that has populated itself! At the cross section of 23rd and Broadway, Madison square park is a popular spot among tourists and locals. It is surrounded by buildings, and has the Nomad public area right next to it. The park has lots of pathway, historical statues, a pond, childrens play area. Lots of good restaurants and shopping stores available around the park.

Very popular among dog owners because it has a massive dog park. In the hours so many dogs play in the park. The first Shake shack store is also inside this park. This brings in a lot of crowd to this park around lunch and dinner time. There are plenty of sitting area in the park, with chairs, tables, benches.

The park had a recent renovation, looks much better since then. Still there are some odd spots that are dirty in the park. Beautiful scenery! Everywhere I look reminds me of mother nature.

Bow Bridge will offer you an excellent opportunity to take a great picture. Whether in spring with the cherry blossom or fall with its incredible colours, this place will give you a unique scenic look of the Manhattan skyline and its reflection on the water.
Its reputation as a symbol of love and romance has made it a top choice for engagements, wedding photos, and other romantic occasions. A charming and romantic place in Central Park. The bridge is beautiful and the view from it is amazing. A calm and pleasant place. Around the bridge there are many benches for resting. Many couples come here to take pictures on their wedding day. Central Park's Bow Bridge is a charming spot, perfect for a stroll together. We loved gazing out at the lake, watching rowboats glide beneath the bridge. The view itself is postcardworthy  the graceful arch of the bridge framed by the lush greenery, with the iconic Manhattan skyline peeking through the trees in the distance. It's a picture of tranquility amidst the city's energy. Whether you're seeking a romantic moment or just a scenic pause, Bow Bridge is a Central Park gem This is a highlight spot in the park.  You can rent boats at the boathouse for 15.00 per hour cash only and 4.00 per each additional 15 minute increment.  They do require a 20.00 deposit on the boats.  At the boathouse, the lake looks small but dont be deceived...its quite large and gives you plenty of places to explore!  The lake is filled with turtles who are very used to the congestion of nyc and not at all afraid of passersby.  You can get great photos on a sunny day.  The Bow Bridge is pretty with spring blooms and is often crowded so you will want to expect people to be apart of your photo opportunities!  Great views with the skyline behind!

Pier 35,"FDR Dr, New York, NY 10002, USA",4.6,40.7094517,-73.9884141,"Pier 35 is an excellent spot for catching a beautiful sunset. The atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed evening by the water. I highly recommend bringing some snacks and drinks to enjoy while you take in the view. Just remember, no alcoholic beverages, as public drinking is prohibited in the US.

Overall, Pier 35 offers a wonderful experience and is a mustvisit for anyone looking to enjoy a serene sunset in the city. Excellent place to go alone, with family and friends. It is ideal for exercising, sitting down to rest or simply walking and watching the sunsetsunrise. The only thing I dislike are people who take dogs and don't pick up the poop, literally everywhere you walk there is dog poop  also people there are so many BIG TRASH CONTAINERS throw garbage into the sea or throw it on the ground  It would be nice if there was some watchman in this area to regulate those situations because a dock as beautiful as Pier 35 is also filling up with homelessness sleeping on the floorseats. I recently visited Pier 42 and it looked new, everything clean, the tennis courts, soccer, basketball, playground, among others. I began to see that more people were going and it gets dirtier and dirtier  It's irritating that people don't respect rules like picking up their own dog's poop or even throwing trash in trash bins... I also saw that currently there are many who want to fish and they cut the security wires, I have also seen that they have destroyed fences to cross faster to the other side of the park... We should be more grateful for our environment and be conscious about keeping it clean because we are the ones who go there to take advantage of what surrounds us.  Amazing and breathtaking spot to hang out with friends and family. The swings and benches are very clean and offer a beautiful view of the Manhattan Bridge along with the East River. Its a great spot to watch sunset by the river, there are 3 swings but most are on queues as people wanted to make pics and videos on social media. Its nice windy on the day I went If you want to catch a great view and just sit, read, or have a conversation with someone, this is an excellent spot. Before entering the pier there are some seats outside in front of the water and is never crowded as the pier is. The views of the Manhattan Bridge and Williamsburg Bridge are stunning!

We did the whole thing in under two hours, and there were so many great places to grab a drink or a bite at the start and finish or along the way. I love that it's self paced. Can't wait to try the quests in other neighborhoods! Will absolutely be recommending to friends and family who visit NYC. We had so much fun doing the Quest! Such a great way to discover a host of curiosities in Brooklyn Heights and have a genuinely fun, engaging adventure along the way. Difficulty level and timing were perfectly pitched. Definitely recommend if you like a clever way and fun way to discover the city. Can't wait to try the other ones! I'd highly recommend Questing NY to tourists and locals alike! It was a lovely way to explore a new area and discover fun facts and features that I wouldn't have come across on my own. The clues were clever and a good level of difficulty  they weren't too obvious but we didn't get stuck at any point. The hunt was a nice length too  it took us a little over an hour but that included a drink stop at one of the suggested cafes. I'd definitely do another of these when I'm next in NY. If youre looking for a fun way to explore NYC  finding oft overlooked city specifics  a Questing scavenger hunt is for you!

My daughter and I followed clever clues with the exact right level of difficulty around FiDi and South Street Seaport areas of Manhattan.  It was challenging, fun and informative.

Truly, Questing scavenger hunt was a great find!

Jill  Niki Z. We had a phenomenal time doing this quest. I went with my teenage daughters, nieces and nephew.  We enjoyed answering the riddles and learning so many cool things about our beloved NYC. Its well thought out with bathroom and snack breaks in between. Whether youre a lifelong New Yorker or a tourist, youll definitely enjoy this one of a kind activity.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Minimalist Fountain,"W 30th St &, 10th Ave, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.6,40.7522507,-74.0011768,"The fountain is under the elevated but the tree is much more interesting.  It's bold color in the gray and shiny city really catches the eye.  There are many other sites nearby Highline Trail, The Edge, Vessel, Hudson Yards so they are worth a stop. I was mistaken that this red tree sculpture was the minimalist fountain. Which should be below it, underneath the highline. Nevertheless, this is a very cool looking and eye catching sculpture. Well, when I think about fountain I have different exceptions than what I could see here. I mean, its not that it has to be the next Trevi fountain, but this is a slab of stone with some pipes within that make water flows on top of it. Pretty cool minimalist fountain at street level directly under The Spur. The water clings to a black rocklike surface as it flows over it and is reclaimed within a 2 inch seem in the surrounding concrete ground without disturbance. It's very smooth and peaceful. Kids like to touch and play with it, although they absolutely shouldn't stand on it for safety. Nice spot for the pictures","Monday: Open 24 hours

Nice elevated walkway with good views of lower Manhattan. Would probably look way better at night or close to sunset. You can even see the Statue of Liberty out in the distance a quiet step back from the usual tourist spots. witness the new york skyline from an elevated position. statue of liberty can also be seen with the squint of an eye. absolutely breathtaking watching the sun set across the horizon of concrete and glass towers. the walkway is nicely lit even as the sky dims. Randomly stumbled across this bridge and was glad I did. I mean, just look at that view!

Its in the middle of the city, just a few steps and youre already looking at NYU.

This was January 2019. You can see a diversity of people just chilling and having fun. Kids playing and running, this man is making ginormous bubbles, the other guy is playing piano, other people are reading, bonding with their family... WSP sure had witnessed a lot. UGHH. Beautiful place. Good place to spend some quality time with friends and family at any time of the day. There are superb food options at street very close to the park. The park is huge and will not feel overcrowded. Overlooks nyu and can also see wtc from there. Its amazing vibe Love coming here because there is always a ton of activity from singers, musicians,  dancers, chess, dog run, playgrounds and squirrels you can hand feed. A lot of students and tourists can be found roaming around. Pretty cool spot for a picnic or just a stroll on a beautiful day. Lots of locals doing yoga playing music just hanging out. Eem like It's a no drama  environment Lots of great local musicians play here and there is food and ice cream as well.  It is actually a very clean park and has a dog park and a children's play area as well.  The area around the park is great and filled with art and food and fun.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 1:00 AM

A great place to relax, talk with family and friends, and even splash around its Jeff Koons sculpture in the summertime when water flies out from the ground, encircling the sculpture! Its located in a loud part of Lower Manhattan, but right next to a silent memorial park. The atmosphere feels heavenly and extremely soothing!! Calling it a park is something of a liberty as it is just a little plaza in front of the 7 World Trade Center 7WTC office tower with a fountaincumsculpture in the middle.  It's a nice place to pause and tie your shoelaces and take a breather.  Not particularly picturesque as it sits within the middle of a concrete jungle of office towers.

It stands on part of the footprint of the old 7WTC which was destroyed on 911.  It is named after the property developer Larry Silverstein who owns most of the WTC buildings except 1WTC.

The sculpture has been changed  gone are the purple balloon things you may see on older images by a big wire three dimensional star thing.... The place is huge.

I am from Chicago and it reminded me of the lakefront path in a lot of ways through the downtown. I will definitely be coming back next time I visit the area.

A true community area with people playing mahjong, filming screenplays, and enjoying nature. An unexpected high from my trip to nyc!! A quiet gem located in the heart of Chinatown. People congregate here to play cards, practice music, and either sit to relax or play ball and exercise. The park is also family and dog friendly but be sure the dog is leashed because there are a lot of people and it's good to know that the dog is close by you. And after you have been thoroughly reinvigorated, there are many restaurants to try out before the day is done. Old men  women playing gomahjong and gossiping while drinking tea, someone playing an amplified pipao and singing in one corner and people playing soccer on the green. One of the more lively and pleasant parks in Manhattan, definitely worth visiting. The building is more symbolic than functional. The building once served as the famous politician's office, but it is now a theater with little connection to this story. The building is lovely and worth a visit. Nice park and playground in the center of Chinatown. The perfect spot to start the exploration of the borough.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Their are many nice views to be seen as well. I love coming here after work to relax and take in the views of Jersey, the Statue of Liberty  and listen to the ocean. It's nice! They're currently doing work on certain parts of it. Most of the park now leading to Battery Park is closed till mid 2025. I can't wait to see how it looks when they finish! Most likely one of the most underrated parks in Manhattan. Might be because need to walk a bit to get there from the train so tourists dont really go there.

Anyway fantastic place to walk around, sit and read in a relatively peaceful environment with the Hudson river in front of you. Helicopters fromto Wall st and 34st can be annoying. Second time in New York  if you are runner, head here in the morning and join in . Saturday  Sunday is the best time to head. So busy with runners and walkers.

Very safe and near to Down Town Manhatten, brilliant views. Such a chilled vibe. It's the best place to see how wonderful the new york is from the other side This park is hidden innext to Battery Park and is one of the nicest spots in the whole city. Its incredibly well maintained, with amazing views, and is rarely crowded. At night, its especially beautiful and well lit. A total gem.

Also, being next to Battery Park and the pier there are tons of opportunities to explore after checking this spot out. You can see some awesome Yachts in the marina as well as eatdrink.

This park has a unique viewing platform I think is awesome as well. Recommend walking up there and taking it in or sitting at the waterfront benches.

Its also incredibly safe here which is always important.","Monday: Open 24 hours

There are a couple of old sailing ships and the Tin Building had some restaurants, but I did not eat there. Just was passing through the area. A unique part of NYC, with character, Architecture, and the atmosphere of a European port town.  Amazing place to walk around, relax and enjoy Both historic and trendy.

I got to see ancient China without even traveling to China. The tickets are pretty cheap, its 5 per adult and 4 for seniors. Even the botanical was so pretty. There was a lot of great views to check out and plenty of pictures you can take. The New York Chinese Scholar garden was the best. I was bummed the harbor eats wasnt open yet. But this is a good place to check out scenery with the elders. Oh did I mention they also have a little pond for the fishes. NATURE ESCAPE IN THE CITY  This is a great escape from the city. Incredible grounds just to walk around in. Plenty of space to play with kids or throw the football. There are turtle ponds and an incredible Chinese garden hidden through one of the front doors  of the houses . Good times, good food, good experience. Highly recommend  Could be a little bit tidy, but it's a really good place to find if you are looking for a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. Great for both kids Childrents Museum and adults alike. I recently visited the Snug Harbor Cultural Center  Botanical Garden and was extremely disappointed with my experience. The grounds were poorly maintained, with overgrown plants and litter scattered throughout the garden areas. Several exhibits were closed without any notice or explanation, which was frustrating. The staff seemed indifferent and unhelpful when asked for assistance or information. Overall, the visit felt like a waste of time and money. I would not recommend visiting this place based on my recent experience. Beautiful garden a delightful place to spend a day. It's best to visit early to explore the entire garden.

My husband and I love to take leisurely strolls around the park, soaking in the stunning views of the Hudson River. Its our goto spot to unwind and connect with nature amidst the hustle and bustle of the city.

The park holds a special place in my heart, bringing back fond memories of my childhood. I remember watching my dad play baseball with his local team, though my attention was often captured by the surrounding nature and wildlife. The joy of exploring the natural beauty of the park is something I cherish to this day.

Another highlight of our visits is stopping by Inwood Farm Caf. Their coffee and pastries are the perfect complement to our park outings. Plus, its a bit special for us since we both worked there briefly together... Say hi to Tom!

Inwood Hill Park offers a unique blend of tranquility, nostalgia, and natural beauty, making it a perfect spot for relaxation and reflection.

I spent over an hour exploring the art. As you wander through the exhibits, you cant help but question whether the works are truly genius and if they have a lasting future. However, considering the free admission Im a member and a free Saturday, it was definitely a good choice.

Theres also an old hearing room in the building, which itself is quite dated. The space felt disconnected from the art gallery experience, and I found it somewhat uncomfortable because of that. I loved going to this offshoot of MoMA, the exhibits were well curated and placards well written! My favorite was the loom artist. I also loved the courtyard and cafe on site. Could definitely kill some time at the cafe sitting and appreciating A small art gallery in old building, loved the run down feel of whole area. Squeaks on wooden floor and graffiti on stair cases. Enjoyed their collection of arts somewhat experimental works there. Recommended. there was not much to look at when i went because there was like 3 things opened  and like twothree galleries were closed. This museum consistently hosts new art exhibitions that marvel at the imagination of artists. Besides the art pieces on display, the museum itself is a work of art.

From some points the World Trade Center seems so near. The Brooklyn bridge, the river, boats, in front and the iconic brown stone buildings behind you is a great feeling. I am a frequent visitor whenever I am in New York. One of the best places to watch a sunset and see the city lights come on. The view is framed by the statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge. You are elevated above the waterfront and looking across to South Manhattan. Nice benches to sit on while you enjoy the view. Before the sunset, take a looping walk through the adjoining Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. A lot of beautiful homes with great architectural details.  The Dumbo area is a short walk from here. A great selection of restaurants to enjoy as well. Brooklyn Heights Promenade is an absolute gem. This serene walkway offers stunning views of the Manhattan skyline and the East River, providing a peaceful escape from the city's hustle and bustle. The energy here is wonderfulcalm, yet vibrant. It's the perfect spot for a leisurely stroll, a quiet moment of reflection, or simply to enjoy the breathtaking scenery. The wellmaintained gardens and friendly atmosphere make it a delightful place to visit. Whether you're a local or a tourist, this promenade is a mustsee. Absolutely gorgeous. If you're looking for fresh air and beautiful scenery,  this is a fabulous choice.   Pack a lunch, there's plenty of benches to sit and relax. The vibe is super chill, and the views are amazing.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 1:00 AM

Bethesda Fountain,"New York, NY 10024, USA",4.8,40.7743214,-73.9708829,"Pretty part of the central park, surrounded by pond, greenery and ancient building. We saw people getting prewedding shoots, there are also some food stalls, and its a must visit for the tourists. Crowded on the weekends but you could also find spots for a some private space and a lot of people bring their dogs to train. Favourite place in Central Park! Many facets to this area and had flashback from movies filmed here.
Mild amount of people selling items, picture perfect from any angle. Stroll around to see it all from different perspectives. Lovely spot within the park. You go can first thing when it is quiet or later in the day when it is alive with families and musical performers. Both have their merits. I can't recommend Central Park enough for anyone visiting New York City. Whether you're looking to take a leisurely stroll, have a picnic, or engage in some serious exercise, this park has it all. It's a great place for photographers and nature lovers alike. Don't miss the iconic Bethesda Terrace and the picturesque Bow Bridge! A must see iconic Central Park landmark memorialized in many movies including Enchanted. Scenic views of row boaters behind the fountain.

African Burial Ground National Monument,"290 Broadway, New York, NY 10007, USA",4.7,40.714538,-74.0044649,"This place is a part of American History I hardly learned about growing up in 1960s and 1970s! I felt honored to experience this exhibit! As one narrator said, this is the Ellis Island for the Africans who arrived in America! As slaves they were abused and suffered tremendously! The movie I saw in their theater brought tears to my eyes! NYC was built on the suffering of these people! I greatly want to thank Ms. Doris for her great customer service and dedication! She was like our personal tour guide! Everyone here had a smile and were courteous the staff and security guards! May I mention that the entrance is currently free to the public! There is a souvenir shop that uses the proceeds from the sales to support the facility! Please purchase somethingjust my opinion! Thank you! This is a very interesting place to visit, but you also need to go to the visitor center, where the true history of the site can be found. Its quite amazing some of the things our ancestors were capable of and sites like this are a reminder of how far we have come. The African Burial Ground National Monument is a profoundly powerful and emotional place that touches the heart and soul of everyone who visits. As you walk through the gates, the weight of history and the significance of the site become immediately apparent. Theres an almost tangible sense of power and reverence that permeates the air, making it clear that this is hallowed ground.

As you begin reading the plaques and the messages inscribed on them, youre struck by a deep sense of sorrow and reflection. The thought of so many people buried here, many without their names known, is a somber reminder of the injustices they endured. Yet, even in the absence of their names, the presence of those buried here is felt strongly. The silent recognition of their lives, their struggles, and their humanity is an act of remembrance that speaks volumes.

In this space, where the unknown should be remembered, I found myself saying a silent prayer for those who rest here. Its a place where your heart and mind are naturally drawn to honor and acknowledge the souls who contributed so much to the foundation of this city and this country, yet were forgotten for so long.

The African Burial Ground National Monument is not just a place of sorrow, but also one of respect, remembrance, and deep connection. Its a place where the unknown are brought into the light, where their lives are honored, and where visitors are given the opportunity to reflect on the history that has shaped us all. This site is a mustvisit for anyone seeking to understand the profound impact of African Americans on the history of New York and America, and to pay their respects in a place that is as sacred as it is powerful. This is an important place to visit. I was a bit disappointed I couldnt go in. The place was supposed to be open to the public on Tuesdays, but for some reason it was closed. Easy to overlook this place with a powerful and fascinating story while you are in the city but take the time to stop by and learn a piece of our history. The NPS attendants were helpful and the presentation was very well done, especially as much of the story is in the history of the site being rediscovered in the 1990s and the public response. Doesn't take long at all to go through the museum and monument but well worth the time even with all the cool stuff in NYC.","Monday: Closed

Battery Park City Promenade,"Battery Park City Esplanade, New York, NY 10280, USA",4.7,40.7114795,-74.0180057,"Very good views from here. You can even catch a glimpse of the Statue of Liberty, although it's too far away to get any decent looking pictures. It's also just a super nice area to have a stroll or even a jog. Great views and head down for some volleyball while your out! This promenade is beautiful and wellkept, of course, but I was especially pleased to see an ADAcompliant picnic table installed. While Id love to see more seating along the promenade, this a great start so good work, BPCA! After 12 miles of walking around Central Park and seemingly everywhere else Manhattan had to offer, I thought I would end my journey for the day. As I headed back to catch the train I saw a group of people playing volleyball. What a dream to be able to head to the pier and play a game with likeminded people. Ditching all plans to head in for the night, I headed in to watch the game. A step or two later, I realized Id stumbled upon one of the most incredibly vibrant sunsets Id witnessed in all my years walking around this planet. I watched until the night sky took over and even then the beauty of the city bouncing off the darkened sky astounded me. I often go back to this spot in my memory to relive the feeling of being in my favorite painting. Do not miss this spot on your journey through Manhattan. Very nice place to relax and watch sunset.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Staple Street Skybridge,"9 Jay St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.4,40.7182678,-74.0094464,"I come here daily to take photos and to take a break from work. A great neighborhood in NYC,it is safe and clean. Chambers street subway station is a few blocks away. The Staple Street Bridge is a truly remarkable structure with a fascinating history. Originally part of a hospital, the bridge was used to transport patients between buildings, adding a unique and functional aspect to its design.

The history of the bridge adds to its allure, as it provides a glimpse into the past and how architectural elements were creatively used for practical purposes. Today, the bridge stands as a reminder of its past while also serving as a picturesque landmark in the heart of New York City.

The location of the Staple Street Bridge is indeed stunning. Nestled among the bustling streets of Manhattan, the bridge offers a peaceful retreat, surrounded by historic buildings and charming cobblestone streets.

Visiting the Staple Street Bridge is a must for anyone interested in history, architecture, or simply looking to explore a hidden gem in the city. Its unique design and rich history make it a truly special destination in New York City. As a photographer I like this historical place. Romantic and truly unique. Interesting little bridge ! Very cute in a very small street.
It can be a great place to take professionalmodel pictures I think. Located in Tribeca neighborhood and considered one of the  must photo ops spots in the city. Staple street is one of the shortest streets in the city only spanning across the 2 blocks so it is very easy to over look that location. Skybridge, that at one time connected 2 parts of the hospital, is great background for fun photo shoots. At the moment theres construction going but you can still enjoy the architecture and get great pictures.","Monday: Open 24 hours

If you are looking for a wonderful immersive Colonial history walking tour with Alexander Hamilton you should take this tour. I love history, and this tour made it come alive. The tour was very interesting and our tour guide, ""Alexander Hamilton,"" was in character from the moment we showed up. His mixture of history and the lyrics from the Musical including identifying the points that were inaccurate were both funny and educational.It was a great time. If you love history this tour is absolutely for you. What a great tour! The guide was knowledgeable, engaging and thorough. We learned so much we didnt know about Hamilton and his interactions and relationships with the other founding fathers. We also learned a couple of things that were inaccurately depicted in the musical. Lastly, the first person account made it more interesting. We were amazed how he stayed in character the entire time. If you are a fan of the musical and love history, you will enjoy this tour. It did not disappoint. If you love Alexander Hamilton, or the history of New York, you will love this unique walking tour.   We went to so many historical spots that I as a New Yorker did not even know existed. The knowledge 'Ham' shared in this tour is amazing and it really makes you feel as if you were there talking to Hamilton. What an amazing experience. I recommend it for kids and adults.

And please donate after the ride! Finally got to try the free kayaking at Pier 26 on a Sunday morning after Labor Day. I didn't have to wait long to be suited up in a life vest, paddle in hand and helped onto a kayak. The water was a little choppy, but navigating with the paddle was fairly easy. It was my first time kayaking, and the guides were helpful in giving tips. They're at the dock and in the water, helping people who may need it. They say we're supposed to have 20 min on the water, but nobody checks. I had fun, I would do it again. FREE kayaking on the Hudson River with gorgeous views of downtown Manhattan and New Jersey. A must do in the summer in NYC.

Note that they do not allow dogs on the kayak here. Also free lockers provided. You will get wet so dress accordingly.

Color Factory NYC,"251 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,40.725773,-74.0053337,"This place is great for families. The staff was awesome. We had an amazing time. Some places you can go and say your glad you did it but u probably won't go back but not the color factory. We will definitely return maybe another location because we have had enough of New York for a while. My favorite room was the dance room but they were all so much fun. This place brought the kid out of my husband and I. We were all able to let our hair down and enjoy each other. They gave us ice cream at the end, which was pretty tasty. The ball pit was awesome, and I love that they have cameras where you can scan your code and get the pics after right to your phone. A 10 out of 10 experience. I came here with my friends and their kids. It was adorable and the adults had just as much fun if not more fun than the kids! Its a bit pricey, so definitely take your time and take lots of pics.   We had a lot of the rooms to ourselves so that was nice! We went on a weekday before noon, so it wasnt busy at all. I can imagine the weekends could be crowded. Mehh..I was not sure how to feel about the exhibits and the whole experience.  It was costly for me and my eight year old son.  I think most of the exhibits were large space to put stuff.  The confetti exhibit was about the best, and its the only exhibit that i liked and my son did too  The best part and what it seemed like everyone enjoyed was the ball pit and most people seemed to just go the museum for that reason.  they do offer a place to check your bag mine traveled with me but i gave them my coat I highly recommend visiting here. My daughter and I had so much fun from beginning to end. Love the cameras that will capture every moment and every room you visits. I love the idea of treats in every room like candy, chocolate, ice cream and souvenirs for take away. The best experience ever. You use your senses to explore colors, its a fun place that lets you explore your child like wonders. I will say its main focus is pictures. I did not spend the time it says it will. I spent around an hour there. Its a cute place to have a date and get to know a person more.
Fun interactive experience for all ages. I will say better to do this with someone else and not alone.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM

There are restaurants and bars around . Few blocks away , there are other carts on wheels selling few other stuff .  Lots of seats  in this pier . There are few piers like this , but I like this one . Restrooms were there but was locked ! Donno why. We had to use restrooms in the restaurant nearby.

Great for groups or date night The city cruise that docks and ships from pier 15 is a wonderful experience.

Mulberry Street,"Mulberry St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.6,40.7187322,-73.9974944,"The feast was great with tons of people and lots and lots of food. The bathroom situation was not good. I couldn't find any of the portable bathrooms and the garbage cans were very scarce. Other than that it was fabulous. The Feast of San Gennaro celebrated by generations of Italian immigrants that settled on the lower east side of Manhattan, each region settled on a different street. The Neapolitans settled on Mulberry St. In 1926 with keeping their Neapolitan traditions they decided to have a party for their patron saint and protector of Naples, San Gennaro which continued year after year something that has now and for decades become not only a New York icon but a world known 11 day event which stretches throughout 11 blocks of the Little Italy neighborhood. For many years this feast has always been an important part of the Little Italy neighborhood and New York City. San Gennaro festival...food family fun, food food and food Went to the St. Gennaro festival with great company. Couldn't wait to get zeppole and ride the ferris wheel. Amazing food fest!

We bought tickets in advance, its easy to find them on the internet, so you dont have to wait in a queue to buy your ticket. It took us just up to 10 mins to wait for our ferry. We had the pleasure of riding with Steve on our NYC harbor cruise on July 1st, 2024. The only thing Steve loves more than his job is his hometown. This guy was FANTASTIC. He had SO much information... we could have rode with him for HOURS and still only get a fraction of his knowledge. He was also super funny and, of course, very friendly. Everything you'd want in a harbor cruise guide. Also, the rest of the crew were equally as friendly, which made for a smooth, fun adventure. Great job, everyone! We took the 1.5hr landmark cruise. If you want to sit outside there is limited covered seating so get in line early. The tour guide was amazing, he was very knowledgeable and funny. The boat is nice as well. We did the landmarks sightseeing cruise.
We suggest to book it online in advance, and if it is summer don't forget your cap and solar cream.

The view and landscape you can see from this prospective will be unforgettable.

American Museum of Natural History,"200 Central Park W, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.5,40.7813241,-73.9739882,"In my opinion American Museum of Natural History is the best museum to visit in NYC. This museum is very interesting and big, I would recommend you to come here in the morning so you have plenty of time to explore the whole area of the museum. The museum has a lot of interesting and different sections to see. In my opinion, the most interesting part of the museum was 4 floor that is about primitive and advanced mammals. Also on the 4 floor you could find fossils of different types of dinosaurs. In addition to my review, I was impressed by the unusual lobby, the lobby has interesting quotes on the wall and in the middle of the lobby there is a fossil of a giant dinosaur. When I went into the museum, I didnt need to wait a long time to get in, but it would be better for you to buy tickets online so you have dont have to worry about the line. Visiting the American Museum of Natural History in New York was an incredible experience that captivated both my inner child and adult curiosity. The realism of the exhibits was truly impressive.

As I wandered through the animal dioramas, I was struck by how lifelike they were. Each display seemed to transport me into a different habitat, with animals looking so real that I almost expected them to move. The detail in the taxidermy and the recreated environments made it easy to lose myself in the wonders of nature.

The crystal and mineral exhibits were equally stunning. I marveled at the vibrant colors and intricate shapes of the crystals, each one presented with such clarity and beauty. It felt like stepping into a dazzling world of natural artistry.
The museum did an excellent job of making the exhibits engaging for all ages.
Overall, my visit to the museum was both educational and aweinspiring. Its a place where the natural world is brought to life in a way thats both magical and meaningful for visitors of all ages. I advice to book your ticket in advance. Wow, this museum is massive! It is huge and so interesting! if youre the type to read most things inside a museum be prepared to spend over 5 hours here. This museum is perfect for people of all ages! I went here solo and I was having a blast. I honestly wished I had more time to read and explore. Pro tip, all CT, NY and NJ residents can pay as much as they want I personally paid a single dollar, just bring your ID. I highly recommend this museum! It is a really fun place, however, it is hard to rate it higher given several of the factors associated with making the trip. First thing to consider is I do not live in NY, I live in central NJ, so getting into NY is an unfortunate factor to add into the equation. Museum parking for more than 5 hours is 46 dollars. That is not bad given NYC, just something to factor into the equation if you plan on driving in. The next thing is the ticket prices. It can be free, however, I wanted to take my girlfriend to the butterfly vivarium. The way the ticket prices work is if you want one of the additional events you need to purchase a general ticket first and then the event of interest is added on afterwards. This means if you are interested in attending the butterfly vivarium, its around 30 dollars a person for the 20 minutes you may be spending there. I suppose it is worth it if you really want to make someone you care about happy, but otherwise that does not seem super realistic. Another factor to consider is the crowds. I went on a Thursday from 11am to closing 5pm. The only time it was even remotely quiet was in the reptile room a relatively remote area of the museum at around 330pm. otherwise the crowds and commotion can be pretty grating. Thinking about it, I wouldn't mind the pricing of everything as much, if it was an actual museum experience, as opposed to the amusement park experience that was presented to us. I am aware if you want to attend the museum after hours from 6 to 8pm you could do that with the membership, however, the membership is somewhat expensive, isn't the most practical for someone living outside of the city, and frankly a strong enough experience was not made on me This museum is incredibly expansive, and I found myself needing to return to fully explore all it has to offer. The exhibits are captivating and I particularly appreciated how the message of interconnectedness was emphasized throughout. I would recommend setting aside 45 hours to truly immerse yourself in all the museum has to offer.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 5:30 PM

Flushing Meadows Corona Park,"Queens, NY, USA",4.6,40.7400625,-73.8406875,"An Urban Oasis Full of History and Fun


Having visited Flushing Meadows Corona Park five times, I can honestly say its one of the most diverse and vibrant parks in New York City. Its a perfect escape from the urban hustle, offering something for everyone, whether youre looking to relax, exercise, or explore.

The park is massive, and every visit reveals something new. The iconic Unisphere is a beautiful centerpiece, and walking around it, especially on a sunny day, feels almost magical. The views are spectacular, and its a great spot for photos. The park also has plenty of wide, open spaces for picnics, family gatherings, or just lounging on the grass.

If youre into sports, there are plenty of facilitiesfrom tennis courts to soccer fields, to biking and running trails. Its a great place to stay active or just enjoy a casual stroll. The playgrounds are wellmaintained and perfect for kids, making it a great familyfriendly destination.

One of the parks biggest highlights is its cultural significance. You can visit landmarks like the Queens Museum, with its Panorama of New York City, or catch an event at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Theres always something happening here, whether its a festival, a concert, or just the daily buzz of New Yorkers enjoying the outdoors.

Flushing Meadows Corona Park is a wonderful blend of nature, history, and activitya place I cant help but return to again and again. If you havent been, I highly recommend checking it out! Flushing Meadow Corona Park is a true oasis! From the moment you step in, you're surrounded by lush greenery, wellmaintained paths, and the serene sound of nature. It's the perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.

The park offers something for everyonewhether you're looking to take a leisurely stroll, enjoy a picnic, or get some exercise. The playgrounds are fantastic for kids, with plenty of space to run around and explore. I also loved the scenic walking trails, which are great for a peaceful walk or a morning jog. Dont forget to check out the world sphere  a landmark in Queens, NYC!

The grounds are impeccably clean, and the landscaping is beautiful, with vibrant flowers and wellkept lawns. There are plenty of benches and shaded areas to relax and take in the surroundings. Overall, Flushing Meadow Corona Park is a gem of a park. Whether you're spending the day with family, walking your dog, or just looking for a quiet place to unwind, this park is perfect. Lovely experience. We went walking at the Pat Dolan trail but of course you can try other options also its a huge park and many interesting trails. So quiet, with amazing smell of flowers and trees and sounds of nature. Many birds can be spotted and rhe lake is beautiful. Highly recommended. Clean trails and safe. Just one issue was that not many bathrooms and seating is seen on the trails. This park retrieves my soul from the gravity of the city, as I pedal around broad roads with no cars and few pedestrians, enjoying the wide open pastoral spaces. Few places can rival Flushing Meadow Park, especially for a runner or a bicyclist, at least in New York City. We visited Flushing Meadows Corona Park for the Queens Street Market. We walked from the metro station through the park. We saw the Unisphere. It was huge. The park was well used with many families and groups on the Saturday night we visited. The street market was amazing. There was foods and drinks from all around the world. We tasted many items and enjoyed all of them. There isn't very much seating in the area of the market. I would suggest bringing a blanket. There was a lot of grassy areas to sit on and enjoy your tastings.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Its one of the more basic zoos Ive ever been too. Its still cute and a nice little stroll. Its historic so I came out but I go to zoos in most cities I visit and other cities such as Chicago have a free zoo with more appeal. At one point I was like where is the rest. lol but still check it out and support The smallest zoo Ive ever been to but it was a great experience. So far the best view I have ever seen of a snow leopard in an enclosure.

The red pandas were adorable and the topical enclosure with all the birds and plans was very nice. Such a fun and cute little zoo! We loved exploring all the animals habitats and the exhibits. The staff were very friendly and the animals seemed well taken care of. We loved the sea lions, red pandas, and the tropical bird exhibits! We had so much fun and the zoo was not too large so you do not get overwhelmed. A perfect day or a half day event, we will definitely be back! If you live in the city and want to experience getting away from the city, without going far, then the Central Park Zoo is a great place to go. Although still technically located in the city, it does not feel like it. The zoo is very well kept and there is a nice variety of animals to see.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM

And theres so much to see and do. I actually visited the Museum of Natural History with my  daughters ASL class and teachers from Truman HS, and my two other kids. We all enjoyed ourselves.

Washington Square Park,"Washington Square, New York, NY 10012, USA",4.6,40.7308838,-73.997332,"Iconic park! Must visit in NYC so much happening all at once its wonderful. Was worried it might be a bit too much for my cat but she had a great time and we just stayed away from big crowds which is actually possible here. Even with the fountain on full blast, people playing music on speakers and a large protest happening it was easy to converse without interruptions in relative peace. Perfect place to have any kind of park experience you want. Essential New York visit! Washington Square Park is a lovely spot, situated right next to NYU, making it a perfect place for students and locals to relax. The park is always lively, with people sitting around, enjoying the scenery. The central fountain is a standout feature and adds to the calm atmosphere. Its a nice, small park ideal for chilling out, reading, or just peoplewatching. With its prime location and welcoming vibe, its a great place to take a break from the hustle of the city. There is a lot of energy at this park, and it's worth a stop. First of all, it's beautiful. Second, you never know what you'll find. I feel like this is still a very bohemian hang out spot it's full of artists, demonstrations, dancers, drum circles, and just about any and everything you can think of. It's a very exciting vibe, and it's nice to snag a spot to sit and just watch the world, watch the art, watch how other people react to things. It also has an extremely interesting history that I think adds to the overall energy of this spot. In my opinion, there's no other place in the city quite like it. A great park with a huge marble arch, a fountain, lots of benches and lots of NYU students and some very eccentric characters.  The park has a kids playground and very clean rest rooms.

The park is very safe even later in the evening.  Always a very enjoyable and entertaining experience.

Highly recommend this park. Fun and lively park to hang out. This park holds nostalgic value to me since I went to NYU and I spent lots of time at the park in my 20s. My daughter loves this park so much so we come here often after dinner and walk around.

I bet it has a lot of history. Lovely photo opportunities. I would say its a pretty park but I cant say that bc I couldnt go inside bc there were locks   I didnt even know manhattan had these exclusive private parks for the rich ppl. Its kinda crazy walking around the park and seeing ppl close the gates which were then locked and on the same block seeing a homeless person walking around Beautiful neighborhood, but park not open to the public except on Christmas Eve. Nonetheless, its a charming area surrounded by historic buildings, and the garden always has something of interest to view. Its now midMarch, and the daffodils within and surrounding the park are in bloom, and the magnolias are either flowering, or about to flower.
My favorite season is fall midNovember to early December the ginkgos  are blazing yellow.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 12:00 AM

However nice place, pretty. Worth a visit. Flowers  all around. Shakespeare would have loved it. The fouracre garden, reminiscent of an English cottage, is overflowing with plants featured in Shakespeare's works. Trees, shrubs, flowers, and herbs mentioned in his plays and poems fill the space, and bronze plaques scattered throughout quote Shakespeare's references to these plants. One of the most relaxing and peaceful areas of the park.  English cottage garden filled with shrubs, flowers and herbs. A few wooden benches allow you to relax and watch the wildlife. A garden to view no matter what time of year and weather. One of my favorite places to visit in Central Park. Must see To be or not to be, thou art in a dream but a dream! Oh! To be with thy self in a mid summer night. Such love, love such. But me! Away away to thine place of peace and joy and the things that tick thy smell. Oh lover! Come away with me, my love!

The pond, the paths, the scenic views it's a really nice park. Talked with a park staff member and appreciate all their hard work maintaining the park. Beautiful park in Flushing Queens. Nature walk near the velodrome very relaxing.
Fun place to enjoy playing softball, tennis, basketball, and there's even a bocce court by the lake.  A really nice park to spend quality time with your kids. This was a very nice place for my dog and I to be secluded and just have space to ourselves even tho there were things going on around us. People had volleyball set up in the corner and a baseball game on the other side of the field. Kissena park is a fantastic place to visit for its gorgeous scenery and plentiful outdoor activities. The walkingbiking paths are beautiful. The lake is stunning and often has ducks, geese, turtles, and even swans. My 5 year old son loves visiting and playing at the jungle gyms. This park has restroom facilities which are usually in good condition. One of my favorite parks in NYC  it has a nice lake with swans. Safe neighborhood and safe to go on your own.

With so much to see and do, two days would be ideal to truly appreciate everything. Although I managed to see everything in one day, I felt rushed through some exhibits. The food was decent, as expected in a zoo setting. Overall, this is a wonderful zoo that I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't visited yet."" After years of living in the city, we finally got our membership and visited the Bronx zoo. Expectations were high, the zoo did not disappoint. It offers an incredible variety of exhibits, with highlights like the Congo Gorilla Forest and Tiger Mountain. The spacious habitats allow the animals to roam freely while still offering visitors fantastic views. The zoos dedication to conservation shines through, with engaging programs that inspire a deeper respect for wildlife. Its a great place for a family outings and connecting with nature We had the perfect day at the Bronx Zoo! Everything was so wellorganized, the animals were incredible to see up close, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The exhibits are thoughtfully designed, making it a great experience for both adults and kids. We especially loved the Gorilla Forest and the Butterfly Garden.

The zoo is clean, easy to navigate, and theres so much to do that we didnt even get to see everything. Well definitely be returning for another visit soon. Highly recommend this zoo to anyone looking for a fun, familyfriendly day out! Went there on a weekday. Not too crowded but the place is maintained so nicely. Lots of variety of animals and exhibits. I love that you see peacocks just walking around casually and hanging out on top of buildings. My kids loved it here So amazing and beautiful. The complex is nice and clean all the time. Animals looks in a good shape and you can see them while eating and walking. Such a nice day and a magic one. Highly recommended for families and children.

Alley Pond Park,"Union Tpke, Oakland Gardens, NY 11364, USA",4.6,40.7423947,-73.7384341,"I grew up near this park over 50 years ago. Ive only been back a couple of times since then. While visiting friends we went there to take a walk. We mostly followed the outermost trails and walked 3.5 miles. Parking on a July Tuesday afternoon was easy with plenty of spaces but I could imagine it fills up on summer weekends. We tried to stay on the dirt trails as much as we could but also walked on some of the paved trails. We only had one short steep hill. The dirt trails are narrow for walking one behind the other. The paved trails are wide for three or four people to walk together. Its a great park to visit and brings back memories of my childhood. Nice place to spend time for family picnic or for jogging and walks etc. there is place for barbecue as well. Very nice and refreshing atmosphere if u want to spend some time from hectic life.
Notes carry everything you might need. There is washroom but it's closed at 4pm. Beautiful park. This park is great for everything. It is large enough to wear. You can truly find all that youre looking for. If you want some interactive summer areas to potentially barbecue, take dogs on beautiful nature trails, or even get on a bike and ride the trails. You really can never go wrong with this park. Sunset view is  matchless . Lake side is Nice and quiet Alley Pond is one of the best parks to visit in the spring! The fields, playground, trees, and benches all contribute to a soothing and welcoming atmosphere here at the park.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Not difficult to find! Grabbed coffee with a girlfriend and thought it would be nice to sit here and enjoy the space but unfortunately EVERYONE sits there to smoke cigarettes and its disgusting. Theres no air circulation in that small space with the waterfall and youre just sitting in an outdoor space where you cant breathe like a vacuum. So disappointing. Such a peaceful, quiet place to step off the busy midtown streets. We found the breakfast here to be delicious and affordable. Wonderful place to sit on the patio when the weather is nice  and we even sat there in the rain and had a great time. Friendly groundskeeper and restaurant owner. Definitely a hidden gem on the streets of NYC. Still a gem in thr middle of the city, but with the construction going on across the street,it takes some imagination to feel peaceful. Every time I visit NYC, I like to spend time checking out new to me parks. On this trip, I found a couple that had waterfalls which seemed unique for a city.

It's a very small park, but it's cute. The waterfall adds a nice element to it. There isn't really grass or anything here, but there are plenty of trees so it's nicely shaded.

I'm not sure I'd add it as a must visit, but it would be a nice spot to eat lunch.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Alley Pond Environmental Center,"229-10 Northern Blvd, Douglaston, NY 11362, USA",4.7,40.7629104,-73.7531177,"This is a nice local spot to bring your kids. The environmental center has a few small animals like rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas, snakes, birds, etc. Depending on the time of day, you may be allowed to pet some of these animals.

There are a couple of trails you can walk through, with lots of trees and marshes by the water. You can walk the entire trail in about 20 minutes. It is obviously beautiful during the summer with lush greenery all around.

You can host a kid's birthday party at this venue for a very reasonable price. We have definitely been here before the renovation and are extremely happy with the new upgrades to this place. Looking forward to our next visit. A hidden for families and environmental science lovers! This place is a community center that educated people about the local salt marshes and the preservation of natural spaces in NYC. The center has a display of small animals, including rodents, reptiles, amphibians, and birds, and programs for children. There are a few trails outside the center! A great place to take your kids. Ive been eyeing this Center since they were being built. Glad its finally opened! Nice nature trail through the back. Im sure it will be even prettier as the weather warms up. The people who worked there were very friendly. One of them even offered the kids animal petting. Not opened on weekends! This is a super fun place to come with young children. You can enter free and see a lot of different types of animals up close in their cages such as birds, turtles, lizards, snakes, bunny rabbits, Guinea pigs, and much more! A neat educational experience for young ones. My son loved it here and so do I. The classes were great and affordable. He loves visiting the animals!","Monday: 9:00 AM – 4:30 PM

Gantry Plaza State Park,"4-44 47th Rd, Long Island City, NY 11101, USA",4.8,40.746716,-73.9582075,"Beautiful and very peaceful. Amazing views of the Manhattan skyline. It's also not overly crowded and mostly locals walking their dogs or kids. The best time is late afternoon to early evening to wind down, enjoy the sunset reflecting off the East River and the buildings across. Or come for an early morning walk to have a calming start to your day. There are plenty of seats along the pathway to just take a few minutes to sit and breathe in the scenery. Perfect for a romantic stroll or a picnic with your family. My favorite spot in the city, with phenomenal views of midtown in a stretch of beautifully manicured promenade with plenty of sunny and shaded benches and loungers. With a wide variety of different use public spaces, people come here to walk, picnic, sunbathe, eat, play beach volleyball, take the ferry, play soccer, fish, and generally hang out under the metropolitan backdrop across the river. Close by Vernon Blvd, there is also plenty of great dining situated nearby! Superb place with nice wind, nice city view, huge Pepsi Cola view. Peaceful. Clean. Short walk from subway station. Train 7 from Manhattan. Nice park at Long Island City next to Hunters Point park. Can sit there for hours seeing the view and feeling the clean wind! Gantry Plaza State Park in Long Island City is an urban oasis that offers a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of New York City. Nestled along the East River, this beautifully landscaped park provides stunning panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline, especially breathtaking during sunset.

The parks design is a perfect blend of greenery and modernity. With its lush lawns, meticulously maintained gardens, and unique gantry structures, it offers a picturesque setting for a leisurely stroll, a family picnic, or a romantic evening. The riverside boardwalk is ideal for walking, jogging, or simply sitting on one of the many benches to soak in the views.

One of the highlights of Gantry Plaza State Park is its peaceful ambiance. Despite being close to the city, it feels like a world apart, providing a tranquil spot to relax and unwind. The park also features playgrounds, sports fields, and fishing piers, catering to visitors of all ages and interests.

The wellthoughtout layout includes plenty of shaded areas, making it a comfortable place to spend time even on warmer days. The proximity to cafes and eateries in Long Island City adds convenience, allowing for a perfect combination of outdoor enjoyment and culinary delights.

Overall, Gantry Plaza State Park is a gem in NYCs collection of parks. Its scenic beauty, thoughtful amenities, and calming atmosphere make it a mustvisit for both locals and tourists looking to experience the natural charm of the city. Beautiful park with views of the NYC skyline, East River, and the southern end of Roosevelt Island. Its not too crowded, with plenty of space to walk around or layout a picnic blanket.

Walking along the park is a delight, with stunning views of Manhattan both day and night. The skyline is breathtaking and provides countless photo opportunities. The park offers plenty of spots to relax, whether you're enjoying a picnic on the grass or lounging on a bench. There are also playgrounds, sports facilities, and gardens, making it perfect for all ages. It's a fantastic place to unwind and soak in the beauty of the city. Highly recommend for anyone looking to experience the best of Brooklyn and Manhattan! This park is one of the most beautiful places in the city and has some amazing views, plenty of hidden spaces, nature, trails, eating areas. All great. The one hold up is with some of the bike and paths infrastructure, the bike path is not as clearly separated from the main path leading to many people blocking the bike lane and a lack of a bike path at all on the part north of the Bridge. Other than that a great place! I just so LOVEEEE this park in Brooklyn! Been here in all seasons but of course love it during summer. A very good place to hangout, sit somewhere, read a book, watch people, have a picnic and best of all see the beautiful facades of Manhattan. A great place for dating too. Theres a lot of restaurant options when you get hungry and coffee places when you just need an espresso shot or macchiato. You can come and see this beautiful park after a long walk at the Brooklyn Bridge and DUMBO. Brooklyn Bridge Park has quickly become my new favorite spot in New York. The breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline and the iconic Brooklyn Bridge are nothing short of spectacular. The park is impeccably maintained, offering a perfect blend of nature and city life. Whether it's taking a leisurely walk along the waterfront, enjoying the lush green spaces, or simply sitting back and soaking in the scenery, every moment spent here is pure bliss.

What really stands out for me, though, is the basketball court. It's the perfect place to shoot some hoops while being surrounded by such an incredible backdrop. The court is always lively, and the energy is contagious. I plan on making this my goto spot for both relaxation and a little bit of play. Brooklyn Bridge Park truly offers an experience unlike any other in the city, and I can't wait to keep coming back! Great place for children to roam around! At the entrance or what I believe to be an entrance had a park near by for kids to play around, and was pretty big. As you go more deeper you'll eventually make it towards a riversorry if I'm wrong with an amazing view and you'll get to see both bridges on both end, also if you have a stroller, a kid, etc, you're just in luck, if you walk past the stair case and continue to walk straight you'll see a gate exiting and turn the first left and it should be steady enough that you won't have any trouble walking through. There's also public bathrooms near by inside a building, except the line can get a bit long if you don't make it time. It is clean although!

Hudson River Park,"61 Chelsea Piers, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,40.7492961,-74.009261,"My Fourth of July visit to Hudson River Park was a memorable experience. The park, stretching along the western edge of Manhattan, offers a stunning blend of natural beauty and urban vibrancy, making it the perfect spot to celebrate Independence Day.

The atmosphere was festive, with families, friends, and couples all gathered to enjoy the holiday. The park's expansive lawns provided plenty of space for picnics, and many people had brought blankets, food, and drinks to set up for the day. The community spirit was palpable, with everyone sharing in the excitement of the day.

As the sun began to set, the view over the Hudson River became even more breathtaking. The golden hues of the sunset reflecting on the water were a sight to behold, setting the stage for the evening's fireworks. The park's wellmaintained pathways and gardens added to the overall charm, making it a pleasure to stroll around and take in the sights.

The highlight of the evening was, of course, the fireworks display. Positioned perfectly along the river, Hudson River Park offered an unobstructed view of the dazzling show. The bursts of color lighting up the night sky were spectacular, and the collective ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" from the crowd added to the excitement. It was a joyous and patriotic moment that truly captured the spirit of the Fourth of July.

In addition to the festivities, the park's amenities were excellent. Clean restrooms, ample seating areas, and wellplaced trash bins helped keep the environment pleasant and tidy. The presence of park rangers and security made the event feel safe and wellorganized.

Overall, Hudson River Park proved to be an exceptional choice for a Fourth of July celebration. The combination of natural beauty, wellmaintained facilities, and a festive atmosphere made for an unforgettable experience. I highly recommend visiting this park, especially during special events like Independence Day. Amazingly beautiful green space along the Hudson River on the west side of NYC.

Plenty of areas to sit and relax either on a bench or on the grass at one of the many garden areas.  The walkways take you along the river or through some of the parks that have been built for people and pups to enjoy.

Smart idea and NYC is doing a great job. Spent a leisurely Sunday morning walking up river from Pier 57 to 76. Just a gorgeous morning before the heat. Cute place!

I ride over from midtown across the Brooklyn Bridge. Enjoy! Absolutely stunning park in one of the most beautiful NY neighborhoods... Park Slope. Gorgeous fields and green lawns, ponds with swans and ducks, colonial arks and pargolas.. It is absolutely amazing especially during October foiladge. This park is beautiful. My fianc and I visit Prospect Park as often as we can. Theres so much open space to ensure a decent amount of privacy. While the size of the park is massive it will still make you feel like you are a small Hometown.
During the weekends, we visit the park, for much needed relaxation. Usually we bring our tent, snacks, drinks, and entertainment, and just veg out.
Theres just a peaceful atmosphere here. This park has such Beautiful landscape, you cant help but to be taken away.
There is always so much to do here. Prospect park is also home to the botanical garden, the boathouse, the lake house and so much more.
Youll never get bored here!
This is a great free place to spend time with family and friends or to spend some time alone!
The next time we visit we are planning to explore more of the park and maybe visit the botanical gardens while we are out exploring. Prospect Park has changed from when I was younger and used to go there. It seems like its not as well kept as central Park less pondered that moment but other than that, its still beautiful. Its still has a lot of visitors and theres so much to see and do enjoy. It's easily the best part of this area.

It is well integrated with surrounding skyscrapers, would be a good idea to combine visit of this park with High Line Park. We went to sit around the park and it was very very chilly that we had to take shelter from the wind. There were many halal food carts around to curb those hunger pangs. We didnt get a chance to go up as it was almost closed when we went down from the edge.

If you wish to admire the unique design, you can visit it. At the nearby Field Of Light Typical NyC playground right next to the FDR expressway and the United Nations! Love this park and the green space it offers to the neighborhood and the many nearby business and office buildings. Many tables and chairs to eat in nature and to explore with a little walk.

The park brings together some new aspects of New York City and respects what has gone before, in a tasteful and visually pleasing way.
The park and views from it are stunning and its a nice and quiet place to reflect and take in the history of this area of Manhattan. This place was so moving. Over 20 years since this tragic moment in history ... and you can still feel the pain. It's a quiet yet bustling atmosphere. The 911 memorial booth there is very nice and the grounds are as serene as it can be. I spoke to one of the security guards there, thanking him and  asking him about about potential threats they come across. To see security, police and military on the grounds made us feel really safe. This will be an annual trip for us.
We bought this memorial back home with us, We shall never forget  Walk up or take the ramp  and find a tree lined space to sit or stroll through. Fabulous sights include the Freedom Tower and an Orthodox Church. There is also the remnants of Koenig Sphere, which sat between the two towers. With access to the walkway over West Street. Liberty Park is a hidden gem in Manhattan, offering a peaceful oasis amidst the bustling city

 Elevated Park Liberty Park is situated atop the World Trade Center's Vehicle Security Center, providing a unique perspective on the surrounding area
 Green Space This oneacre park offers a tranquil atmosphere, complete with lush greenery, teak benches, and a ""living wall"" featuring various plant species
 Public Art Liberty Park is home to several iconic sculptures, including Fritz Koenig's ""The Sphere"" and Douwe Blumberg's ""America's Response Monument""

My Experience

 Peaceful Atmosphere Visitors can enjoy stunning views of the World Trade Center campus while relaxing in a serene environment.
 Accessibility The park is open daily from 600 a.m. to 1100 p.m. and is easily accessible by public transportation or on foot.
 Points of Interest Take in the sights of the Memorial Plaza, One World Trade Center, and the Oculus while exploring the park. There are several interesting things to see at Liberty Park  mostly the sculpture The Sphere, which was heavily damaged on 911 when the twin towers fell on top of it. Its also open at night and we came by here the first night we were in New York just to sit and talk.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Hunter's Point South Park,"Center Blvd, Long Island City, NY 11101, USA",4.8,40.7422936,-73.9606831,"Under the full moon at Hunters Point, the world slows into a dream. A soft glow spills across the landscape, turning the sea into a mirror of silver light. The air is cool, carried by a gentle breeze that feels like a secret, brushing against your skin.

The moon, heavy and luminous, rises high, casting long, delicate shadows across the earth. Waves shimmer as they meet the shore, quietly reflecting the nights calm. The breeze carries the faint scent of salt and earth, mixing with the stillness of the evening.

Everything feels hushed, yet aliveperfectly balanced between light and dark, motion and stillness. Here, nature seems to breathe with you, its rhythm soft and steady, inviting you to pause, to linger. In this quiet beauty, theres a feeling that time dissolves, leaving only the moon, the breeze, and the quiet pulse of the night. Beautiful views, not only on Manhatten but also on the new buildings on Green point side, and Williamsburg bridge. The park itself is nice for a 30 min walk with great sections of restored native plants.  There are a lot of great restaurants in the area, and a ferry trip to or from the park is fun Very nice park with boardway and multiple piers. Nice view of the city. At the end of it there is diner with nice music to chill with. Multiple fixed benches around. Lovely! What a lovely park! I just discovered this jewel recently when I was visiting this neighborhood. Im upset that I wasnt aware of it sooner because I wouldve spent most of my summer here. The park is really beautiful and clean.

There is truly something here for everyone. There is a sand park, a playground for the kiddies, ample grass to have a picnic or just lay out to grab that good ole Vitamin D.

I will definitely frequent this park moving forward in the future. Great place to remove your monotonous life. We took the ferry it was really good enjoying the whole night view and the calm breeze","Monday: 6:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Its a beautiful park with water fountain and interesting sculpture near the court house. The court house and the surrounding buildings are all amazing architecture to enjoy. Now has enormous interesting sculptures in the park, come and check them out! Beautiful little park, and a nice sport to grab a coffee and sit while exploring this area and the financial district. Lots of benches, and an interesting collection of art. Took pictures of this closeted lesbian couple out of the blue and then they loved it and left and I cried in the bench cause it made me feel happy to have gotten the chance to see that love and capture it for them.

Lighthouse Park,"910 Main St, New York, NY 10044, USA",4.6,40.7719202,-73.9409515,"We used the red free shuttle bus to get from the tram station to the lighthouse park. The lighthouse and the girl puzzle monument were great to view. Restrooms are available here and we saw a lot of people having picnics and get togethers on the laws.
Worth a visit for the beautiful views. Peaceful park at the northern tip of Roosevelt Island. The place is beautiful just by being surrounded by East River on both sides.  Presence of art work by Amanda Matthews, dedicated to Nellie Blys asylum investigation, makes the park visit unique. It takes about 1.5 hours to make full perimeter loop around the island and check its parks  outdoor attractions. The views here are simply breathtaking! If your looking for a relaxing place to escape from the world  perhaps find innerpeace or meditate this is an incredible place to start! It's nice to also see ships gently pass by from a nice park bench or other seating nearby. The outdoor artwork may be fascinating to some. There are also restrooms located onsite in case facilities may be needed. The park is also meticulously clean for those trying to escape all litter  Great park in the courner of the island , nice view you can enjoy the city views, and the lighthouse, and the statues, nice place to visit with your family. I came to Roosevelt Island often by train and mostly hung out by the bottom of Island and never come up to the top of Island. Today I came by car because I also took my dog with me. It was different feeling coming this way and I have to park my car at the parking lot because on the side street only allow the Island resident to park.

I walked about 15 minutes to the Lighthouse, and it wasn't crowded at all on Saturday. The park was nice and has some Arts make the park more interesting. Around lighthouse has big curb to sit and see east river and you can enjoy view of both side of Manhattan and Queens. Compare to the bottom of the Island I think the feeling isn't the same. Down there is more to the ocean and up here is more river vibe. I also heard in the summer lots of people like to come to this park for BBQ. It such a nice park.

There are many ways to come to this Island by train, car, furry or even on foot.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Teardrop Park,"Warren St, New York, NY 10005, USA",4.7,40.7170715,-74.015524,"One of our favorite parks. It genuinely feels magical to both parents and kids you almost forget where you are! The way its natural elements appear and move between crowded columns of high rise apartments is top tier design. The tall slide is super fun. We like to start at Teardrop Park, then go over to Rockefeller Park, and finally run down the Battery Park Esplanade to get out the remaining zoomies. Its open again! My very favorite spray park in the city, tucked into the trees and rocks with plenty of shade. Be warned, the wood deck is incredibly slippery and everyone will probably wipe out at some point. Decently sized park in the midst of an apartment complex with lots of rock formations to explore  Epic and epically hidden slide nestled away like a secret treasure, it beckons adventure seekers of all ages. Heres why its a hit with kids and parents alike. Imagine stumbling upon a hidden passage in a magical forest, concrete jungle. Thats the feeling this slide evokes. Its unassuming appearance conceals a thrilling descenta rollercoaster ride in miniature.
Our childrens eyes widen with delight as they discover the slides existence. Their laughter echoes through the air as they take turns sliding down, their imaginations soaring. Kidsapproved!
The park becomes a canvas for their game of hide and seek, a haven. The slide is a whimsical journey. Each descent is a miniadventure of fear and adrenaline.

Ah, the delicate balance! While the slide captivates the kids, we play park sentinels.

So, next time you visit, embrace the magic of The Slide. Its not just a piece of playground equipment, its a portal to wonder.   I love the water sprinklers here! That big slide? Amazing! There is also a really nice sized sandbox. However, the water is not working on that side. However, this little park is a great hidden gem.

Greenacre Park,"217 E 51st St, New York, NY 10022, USA",4.8,40.7562408,-73.9692841,"It's a beautiful hidden gem in the city. Great for getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Very calming to hear the water cascading on the rocks, very Zen! It's not super huge and I wouldn't call it a park, but to each his own. I enjoyed my time here, with my Mom and my ExWife. Looking forward to my next visit. Also, it's very clean and wellkept. I love small private park by the synagogue and am impressed by its cleanliness and the kindness of the staff. It is the safest sanctuary in the city.

Chatting to their park rangers, amazing gentlemen, I learned about the hard work they put into maintaining the park  from washing the streets at 67am daily to cleaning the park multiple times a day.

In addition to the cleanliness, the design of the park is absolutely gorgeous. They always have seasonal plants, I love the stone tiles on the wall, and of course the waterfall in the back of the park gives a soothing white noise. I come here not only when I am passing by, but when I want to meditate or focus or relax. Especially when the park is less busy, it gives so much serenity in my mind.

I have nothing but respect and gratitude for their dedication, making this park a beautiful and welcoming place to visit, and the safe place in our neighborhood. Not too far from Paley park. In between busy streets  tall buildings, lies a very scenic, calm, portrait like park. Just next to synagogue. 12 min walk away from Chrysler building. A beautiful hidden oasis in the heart of Turtle Bay. So peaceful on a Sunday afternoon. Enjoyed quiet moments and different vantage points changing seats from one area of the park to another. Meticulously curated landscape, structural and horticultural design. This has to be one of the loveliest place anyone could visit. There are a ton of chairs and tables all around, you can see it close up or close enough or even watch the water fall from the second floor or what I like to call a balcony area. it may be a bit confusing trying to find it,almost like a hidden gem so I offered how the entrance looks like. There are also trash Can's around, it's mostly quiet with the sound of the water fall mostly taking around. I would definitely come visit if you need some calming time or need time to yourself. If it starts raining cause of horrible luck you have, or the sun is to bright there's a balcony as I stated before and it has a roof you can stay under.

Don t miss the Peter Pan Statue near 86th street entrance Very nice park with dog parks, trails, beautiful flowers, grassy areas, playground, pickle ball courts, basketball courts and restrooms.

Lot of places to sit and enjoy the views of the city. Great place for lunch with incredible views of New York skyline. lots of different cuisines to choose from. Quality food. Hip environment. Be sure to take the elevator to the rooftop for the best view. The Playground is beautiful you got the water for hot days, its very clean, drinking water and 3 different Play areas! A few swings would be nice but a lot of climbing options! And the view is unrealistic!! Amazing area to walk around! Looks like theres stages and many places for the community to gather and hang out! Its unfortunate you cannot go on many grassy area or bring in dogs... If you have a chance to chill here, don't miss it. Grab a sandwich and stretch out. Take in the expansive views.

The Great Lawn,"79th Street & 85th Street, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.7,40.7816915,-73.9664192,"One of my favorite spots in Central Park. Really, you can have a picnic here, walk around, play sports and see the amazing views of the city. The Great Lawn in Central Park is the perfect spot to unwind, whether you want to relax on the grass, play sports, or simply peoplewatch. Surrounded by trees, this vast, open space offers beautiful views of both nature and the city skyline. Its a peaceful retreat from the city's noise, yet you can still feel connected to the energy of New York.

The lawn is ideal for picnics with friends, sunbathing, or even a casual game of frisbee or soccer. During summer, it becomes a lively gathering spot for concerts and performances. I was lucky to catch a free event here, and the atmosphere was incredible!

Its also wellmaintained, clean, and feels safe, making it a great place for both locals and tourists. If you're visiting Central Park, I highly recommend stopping by The Great Lawn to experience a little slice of serenity in the middle of NYC. This place is a great pitstop  when visiting Central Park!  The Great Lawn  is a wonderful green  space in the middle of the park. This is a great place to relax and unwind, have a picnic , play frisbee , and take some Instagramworthy  photos  of views  of the city!  I wish I came here more often! It was a very convenient place and atmosphere was great. Me and all my friends enjoyed being here and love the nature of the place.

Randall's Island Park,"20 Randalls Island Park, New York, NY 10035, USA",4.4,40.795813,-73.922517,"It's towards Costco, on the east River. Need to cross this bridge over to the island. Bridge view and scene is nice... But the moment I reach the island park, gives me the notsafe vibe. Trash, gatherings not the kind at central park and most importantly, 3 police cars and officers were there, standby with lights all lit up, 1 cop car was patrolling as well. Certainly don't see that in any other NYC parks. Not recommended. Too bad. Nice place but safety concerns. I recently had the pleasure of attending the Pokemon Go 2024 festival at Randall Park, and I must say it was a fantastic experience. The park was wellorganized and maintained, and I was impressed by the cleanliness of the toilets, which had been recently cleaned.

However, there was one minor issue that affected our enjoyment of the park. Due to the morning rain, there was no proper draining, which resulted in some areas being waterlogged. This made it a bit inconvenient to navigate through the park.

Additionally, myself and many other attendees noticed a significant presence of spotted lanternflies in the park. It would be beneficial for the park management to consider spraying to control their population and ensure a more enjoyable experience for visitors.

Despite these minor drawbacks, the park was bustling with people and the atmosphere was truly amazing. Being part of the festival was a memorable experience, and I would like to express my gratitude to the organizers for putting together such a fantastic event.

Overall, Randall Park is a great venue for events and gatherings. With some improvements in drainage and pest control, it has the potential to be an even more remarkable destination. Thank you! I was there for gofest. Really nice spot. Great views. Nice athletic field Really great staffing by NY PD and emergency personnel as it was extremely hot. A place full of beautiful views and playgrounds for variety of sports. Plenty of picnic and bbq spots. Went to Pokemon Go Fest. The park is beautiful, very big with views of the city.

As for the restrooms, they only had porta potties but I don't know if it was because of this event. We didn't see any other restrooms.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Note the park has different closing times depending on the season generally before sunset. Definitely a must visit while in Roosevelt Island, this park offers amazing views of the east river and New York City. We could just sit for hours here, relaxing, talking or reading a book.

Astoria Park,"19 19th St, Astoria, NY 11105, USA",4.7,40.7785364,-73.9228336,"Astoria Park has quickly earned a spot as my second favorite park, right after Brooklyn Bridge Park. While Brooklyn Bridge Park edges it out with its iconic city views, Astoria Park has so much to offer that its become a close contender. This park truly caters to anyone looking for a mix of relaxation and activity. It boasts a basketball court, tennis courts, a soccer field, and my personal favorite, a wellmaintained track and field. The track is perfect for running, and the entire park is wellkept, making it an ideal spot for anyone looking to stay active or just enjoy the outdoors.

What sets Astoria Park apart is how it combines both the serene atmosphere of a neighborhood park with facilities that encourage an active lifestyle. Whether youre into sports, running, or just taking a leisurely stroll, this park has something for you. Im definitely planning to visit often, especially as I focus on getting in good shape. With its ample amenities and wellmaintained spaces, Astoria Park is a hidden gem that Im excited to make part of my regular routine. Highly recommended for anyone in the area looking for a versatile and inviting outdoor space! Amazing place to walk, relax, be in contact with the nature. A beautiful view to the river. On Sunday you will always have something to see. Excellent place to plan a picnic or if you want to eat something you have restaurants near by. Amazing park a lot of families... lots of activities... Park on the water that provides a cooling breeze a lot of trees for shade open spaces for concerts and groups to play lawn games! Pool, sprinklers, park, bike friendly, Hot dog vendor sometimes...ice cream truck near big lawn near the water. Track, tennis courts and a soccer field All beautifully maintained. Very nice park, I was there for a birthday party in the north area of it. I will definitely go back to explore it more. Also full of restaurants around!!! I highly recommend it for a walk with your dog, with your kids and for a nice date and enjoy an amazing Greek meal after a relaxing day in the park!!! Enjoy  Beautiful park! We went as a group and brought our blanket and enjoyed snacks and chats. Lots of open space and nice scenery of the bridge, ferry, and water. There were ice cream trucks but I wouldnt recommend it since they were pretty expensive for what it was. 1 vanilla with sprinkle cone was 9. But it was nice on a hot day. The playground was great for the kids. The pool wasnt filled but I went at the beginning of spring so I wouldnt expect it. The one Cherry blossom tree was so cute! Highly recommend for running, walking, picnic, and naps as it feels very safe and clean. There was also a public restroom which is always great.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Most notable feature of the park is wine bottle sculpture Private Passage that is a representation of interior stateroom on older cruise ship Queen Mary. We walked along the Hudson River a couple of time and this was a nice little park for a break from all the walking.

Some weirdly interesting bottle shaped thing here to cant remember what it was but something to do with cabins on a ship or the like, pretty cool tho!

Also a good place for the kids to blow off some energy on the grassed area.

Could do with a refreshments cabinshop, as with many of the pier areas the buildings here look mostly derelict. Great place to relax and unwind. Located right by the Hudson River, the views of New Jersey and able to as far north with a clear site of George Washington Bridge. You can layout on one of the wood  flat bench and watch as the sun sets over New Jersey, or sit at one of the picnic tables and enjoy your meal and a drink with friends.

Definitely something different from other New York City Parks , small but very interesting. Always busy and popular A beautiful tribute to the home where pur fight for Equal Rights took off.  All done up in Pride colors for June. Quite clean and wellmaintained compared to other New York City Parks, probably because it's a national park. Definitely something different from other New York City Parks, worth a visit! Loooove Christopher St and Bleecker St. Unfortunately lots of things do not exist anymore! No more Factory Cafe on Christopher St., no more Universal Grill and Leroy St. and Bedford St. Soooooo sad

Liberty State Park,"1 Audrey Zapp Dr, Jersey City, NJ 07305, USA",4.7,40.7057531,-74.0491477,"Liberty State Park is an absolute treasure, offering stunning views and a serene atmosphere that you can enjoy day or night. During the day, the park is vibrant and full of life, with expansive green spaces perfect for picnics, leisurely strolls, or just soaking in the incredible views of the Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty. However, I definitely recommend visiting at night. There's something magical about the way the city lights shimmer across the water, creating a peaceful and almost enchanting atmosphere. The park feels like a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle, making it the perfect spot for an evening walk or just to sit and take in the beauty of the night. Whether you're a local or just visiting, Liberty State Park is a mustsee destination, especially after the sun goes down. After visiting Statue of Liberty multiple times from Manhattan, this was the first time we went from Liberty State park. I would recommend anyone to take the ferry from this side if possible. You can avoid the Manhattan busyness and the views from this side are totally worth it! It's beautiful and you can see the whole city much closer. We went on a Monday morning and it wasn't crowded to get into the ferry. The only downside we had when we went was that there was a walk to the ticketing area from the parking lot Liberty State Park is truly a gem and one of my favorite places to visit. The park offers breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline, the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island, making it a perfect spot for anyone looking to enjoy some stunning scenery.

The expansive green spaces are perfect for picnics, leisurely strolls, and family outings. There are plenty of walking and biking paths that wind through the park, allowing you to explore and appreciate its natural beauty. The playgrounds are wellmaintained and provide endless fun for kids, while the Liberty Science Center nearby offers an educational experience for all ages.

One of the highlights of Liberty State Park is the accessibility to the water. Whether you're taking a ferry to visit the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, or simply enjoying the marina, the proximity to the Hudson River adds a refreshing element to the park.

The park is so clean and wellmaintained, with ample amenities and facilities to ensure a comfortable visit. The staff and rangers are friendly and always willing to help with any questions or needs.

Overall, Liberty State Park is a wonderful place to spend a weekend. Whether you're looking to relax in nature, engage in outdoor activities, or soak in some history, this park offers something for everyone. Highly recommended for both locals and visitors! The best view of the statue of liberty by land. A true gem of Jersey. Great for long walks, bike rides, or any exercising. Even if you want to sit and marvel at the views. This park is spacious, well kept and paved with safe pathways. I cant wait to be back! This is a great recreation area. They have paved paths throughout which are great for running and biking. I like to bring a picnic and find a spot under a tree or on the grass overlooking downtown Manhattan. There is plenty of parking and restrooms are available. The most recent time we went, there was an ice cream truck in the parking lot. This park is also pet friendly.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Mill Rock Park,"East River, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.8,40.7805039,-73.9384197,"A very underrated city park that is often overshadowed by the other more wellknown parks. You'll find very few tourists and no cyclists. The beaches are never crowded. The best time to visit is probably in the dead of night. Mill Rock Park is a unique, gross unless seagull poop is your thing, cramped and hard to get to little pile of rocks in the East River. Ew. As I slipped back into my kayak after walking around, I couldnt shake the feeling that flesh eating bacteria were now a part of my day.

On the flip side, the views of Manhattan, Queens and Randalls Island are second to none. Truly stellar. So, 3 stars instead of 1.

Bring your camera, some nose plugs and a few gallons of bactine for the paddle bavk. During the War of 1812, the War Department built a blockhouse with two cannons on Great Mill Rock. This fortification was part of a chain of blockhouses that was intended to defend New York Harbor and protect the passage into Long Island Sound against the British Navy Love circumnavigating this island. There's an inlet on north end to rest from river currents. Island is a protected bird sanctuary, so there's absolutely no going ashore. Beautiful when green. Super cool .

And you can just sit there and read a bookand no one's going to bother you. Very peaceful! I absolutely love this park! Do you know how hard it is to find a clean patch of grass to lie down on in the city?! Plus honestly the fact that the grass is dog free makes for the greenest most beautiful grass ever. This place my favorite Chelsea oasis. I just discovered this small park in the middle of the city. It is perfect to sit and read a book, there are plenty of places with shadow and although you can hear the construction workers and the traffic, you can also hear the birds, the wind and many animals.

Great location to view fleet week and parade of ships. There's a small dog park, for the kids a water fountain for those hot summer days. Lots of seating, lawn area with trees and shaded areas. Bike, kayak and paddle board rentals. Live bands in the summer. Bathrooms This is a nice quiet place either a view of Intrepid, Jersey city and Hudson river. It also has a small lawn and a few chairs and tables. This pier is one of my favorite free spots to enjoy an amazing view of the Hudson River and the stunning skyline of New Jersey and Manhattan. It's especially breathtaking during sunset when the sky turns to hues of orange and pink. The best things in life are free, and this view is certainly one of them. The second best things can be very expensive. It is a special place for me due to proximity to my home and it's also my go to place to have a walk, jog or cycle along the river , which is incredibly soothing and rejuvenating. So, whether you're a local or just visiting, I highly recommend taking a stroll down this pier and taking in the stunning sights of the city. Nice pier to walk on, has a water splash pad in the beginning of it, but was closed for the winter. End of pier has a few metal tables that has 4 chairs attached, good to sit, eat  look out at the water. Also quite a few bench seats all over. Entrance to Circle line is also there at beginning of pier. You can watch the boats go out  come in. There was also an outdoor bar with seating at the beginning of the pier. Kayak rental shop is also located on pier. This was my first time actually being inside of the Pier. I always pass it while riding in a car. The day that I visited was on a weekend. They had the sprinklers    which were good for cooling off during a heatwave. Kayakers were out and enjoying the river.  I was so glad to see they had public restrooms.

My favorite was the eyes with the colorful paint splashes. I was on a selfguided walking food tour of Greenwich Village and decided to take a walk through this alley on the way to have a knish across the street at Yonah Schimmel's Knish Bakery. I'm so glad I did! The raw street art was an unexpected hidden treasure I might have otherwise missed. I was able to feel the artists' passion. Amazing street art to be seen here!  So glad we saw this!  Took a fun Graffiti Workshop by Graff Tours... if you have an artist in the family, this was a very unique experience! Always love the change and installation of continuous art. Various artist from all over the city, I'd guess the US and the World post up in this exquisite park. In the summer the mosquitos are prevalent. You may see a rat or two all year round,,, Hey it's the Norwegians rat

It has a soccer and volleyball grounds which is fun to watch by enjoying the shades at the park. It would have been even better if there was a public restroom in there. Fantastic park in Chinatown that fosters so much ChineseAmerican culture. Chinatown locals hang out playing music, smoking cigs and playing cards or games at the designated tables. Its quite endearing to witness and is a beautiful stop in the summer time. cool park in Chinatown. benches, tables, green space, sunlight, some exotic conversations also possible ofc Beautiful well taken care of park where the locals come to hang out.

I feel safe and it's fun! You should definitely go even if it's just once. I had an amazing time at the Yankees vs. Cleveland game on 08222024. The atmosphere was electric, and the highlight of the night was watching Aaron Judge hit a home run. It felt like the entire stadium erupted in excitement, and being there to witness it in person was truly special. Moments like this remind me why I love baseball so much. It was an honor to be part of that unforgettable experience. Had an awesome time at Yankee Stadium suites! The space was super comfy and had amazing views of the field. The food and drinks were delicious, and the staff was really attentive. If youre looking to watch a game in style, definitely check out the suites. Highly recommend! Yankees stadium is cool. The stadium itself is pretty cookie cutter and nothing remarkable, but the staff, fans, and amenities make it an above average ballpark. The best thing about Yankee Stadium is definitely the atmosphere, which makes it a mustvisit for baseball fans. They also had a really cool bartender, who made me an awesome margarita, which isnt something you see at every ballpark. Very happy I was able to cross Yankee Stadium off of my sports tourism bucket list! Its Yankee Stadium, how can it not be five stars?!
To say this place is like a coliseum is an understatement. The facade is grand and inside of Gate 4 you just feel like youre in some place special and important.
The main concourse is wide and full of vendors and screens displaying whats being served. Prices are reasonable for a largemarket team, and the lines werent bad at all. There really isnt a bad view anywhere in this ballpark. We were pretty high up but could still see everything going on, and felt on top of the game. There isnt much of an ingame experience, but the production team still puts on a great show.

miss KOREA BBQ,"10 W 32nd St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.7,40.7473149,-73.9864768,"If could give 6 stars I would.  This is one is the tastiest meals I've ever had.  We wanted authentic Korean bbq and we found it at missKorea.   We ordered the pork dumplings fried, glass noodles with sauteed seafood and vegetables and marinated beef short rib. All were incredible.  Service was exceptional.  Only drawback is price.  But still totally worth it We just stumbled upon this place and went in, had no idea about it being in the Michelin guide list. It was really expensive, didn't expect it to be that pricey. The food was good, but don't order the chicken, it was over cooked and dry. Great service. In hindsight I'm sure I would have gotten better korean food at a much cheaper price. In the end it wasn't worth the price tag. I've visited this BBQ restaurant twice after participating in a running events near Central Park, 2 weeks in a roll.

One of the standout features of this place is its consistent availabilitythey're open all the time, making it a perfect postrun destination. The quality of the meats, especially the beef, is exceptionaljuicy, flavorful, and prepared to perfection.

I particularly appreciate the option to choose between marinated and nonmarinated beef, catering to different preferences.

The staff are friendly, attentive, and contribute to a welcoming dining experience. Miss Korea BBQ in NYC offers highquality ingredients, particularly notable in their beef dishes. The atmosphere is lively and bustling, contributing to a fun dining experience as everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. The staff assists with grilling orders right at your table, enhancing the experience. For a party of 23, I'd recommend ordering a large beef set. However, the restaurant and its facilities could use better maintenance, as they appear somewhat rundown. Despite this, it doesn't significantly detract from the overall experience, and I would still recommend a visit. I stopped by at the midnight and staving.
We ordered two types of meat, and one soup.
The waitress name Elizabeth takes care of us. She's professional of cooking and very kind.
The beef was awesome and soup was so good.
Highly recommend to try this place.","Monday: Open 24 hours

With many unique dishes you won't find at other places, like the squid rice dish. They also offer a generous amount of banchan side dishes, and the service is excellentthey kept refilling our side dishes without us even asking. I truly hope this restaurant never closes that's the highest compliment I can give! It is a very lively place, with a sweet old fashioned Korean decoration. This time I only had vegetarian food. The food was good, but not outstanding. I liked the fluffy texture of the buckwheat pancake, and it looks so good. The perilla seed stew was interesting, but not wow. The signature homemade tofu was pretty bland. They have a few vegetarian options. Most of the staff was friendly, and service was quick. They don't take reservations and there is usually a wait Great Korean spot. It is quite busy and they dont take reservations so either come right when they open or have to put your name down on a waiting list. They are known for their homemade tofu. All the food is tasty and the spicy dishes definitely have a kick. This place always has long line, and does not take reservations.  The wait is long but totally worth it.  The special dishes are so delicious and you cannot find them in other Korean restaurants.  I especially enjoyed the eggplant rice.  The side dishes are very unique and yummy too. I was so curious to give a shot on seeing the people waiting in line to taste the food here.
Food was amazing and worth the wait.
So visited twice lunch  dinnerwhen I was in NYC for a week.

Customer service was top notch and with lots of smile on their face.

Normal combo comes with 9 dishes every dish were great It is served as a course meal and the chef kindly explains the names and ingredients. The food is decent for a full course meal. Parking is allowed for one car, and the valet fee is 5,000 won. It's usually popular as a onetable restaurant for proposals, but even if it's not a proposal, I think it's a good place to spend a happy time with happy people. The chef is friendly and the food isn't spicy, so I like it. A dining restaurant near Apgujeong and Sinsa that presents an optimization rather than a typical onetable restaurant.

Dinner for 2 hours is around 240,000 to 300,000 won for two people.
A private culinary feast for two, including salads, whole dishes, pasta, steak, strawberry tiramisu and tea, will unfold for about 90 minutes.

It is also famous as a sacred place for special anniversaries and proposals. Don't forget to write a guestbook and take a commemorative photo optional after the meal.

Wine list needs upgrade though.. Good New York theme park in Yuido I went for a dinner course after watching the performance, but the food wasn't to my taste. To be honest, it was a bit below average. But the appetizers of crab meat and avocado and crackers were very delicious.
But the seat was in a corner and the seat next to it was empty so it was private and very comfortable.
The atmosphere was very nice and cool, and the interior was really my taste. I don't think they read any of the requests I left when making a reservation. Regarding seating, I left a request when making a reservation in advance, but I was directed to a corner seat that was not reflected at all. Even though it wasn't full. There was no understanding or guidance regarding this.  I had a bad feeling from the beginning because I was shown to a bad place, but as expected, it was difficult to call the staff because it was in a corner.. I wasn't even within visibility, so I had to call them only once when I was passing by. Of course, the service was kind, but is this correct in a hotel restaurant?  I remember last year's lunch course being wellorganized and delicious, so I visited again this year, but even though I had a much more expensive course this time, I felt it wasn't worth the price.

Joa Kitchen,"46 W 36th St., New York, NY 10018, USA",4.9,40.7503092,-73.9855909,"Hidden gem!!!! Just a bit away from time square. Service was good. The food was super tasty we ordered Joa Noodle, Dumplings,  Chicken bites soy garlic flavor, and bibimbap and I can't believe how large the portion is for the cheap price! In New York!!! Hands down the most shrimps I've had in any bibimbap. And one of the best Korean spicy seafood noodles I've had. Will definitely return if in the area!

The only down side is that the restaurant was small, without many tables or seats. Most customers come in and order take out. Prices are unbelievable, especially considering the size of the portions, and the quality! I had a super yummy Tuna melt sandwich for only 10 bucks! Also they have a huge menu, and everything seems super tempting! Last but not least, the staff is very polite and nice.
Will definitely go back to this place many more times Visited without having seen any reviews, and were so pleased that we happened upon this small kitchen. The staff were all really friendly, and seemed genuinely happy that we enjoyed our food. We had breakfast, and managed to eat in on one of the small tables. Great value for money  would def recommend. This place is just awesome!!

The price is reasonable and the portion is big. Foods always come out so quick. And people there are friendly.

During my whole stay in mid Manhattan, I went to this restaurant every night with my kids, Korean food lovers p

Atmosphere was on the relaxed side. Great for early, casual dinner. Atoboy offers a solid dining experience with wellexecuted dishes. The food was good, but nothing really stood out as exceptional. The ambiance was great, with a laidback, comfortable vibe, and the service was friendly and welcoming. Overall, its a nice spot for a casual, enjoyable meal, though I wouldnt say its a mustvisit for those seeking something extraordinary. Service was really nice and friendly. I enjoyed the menu in May, the tartare was great. The server recommended the sweet shrimp and peas which was not something I've had before. Pork belly was a bit dry and overdone but it was a nice portion. The sides at the end were great, they had picked banana peppers that were insanely tasty. The fried chicken was extra but at a whopping 30 so I skipped it despite hearing how great it was. Maybe next time. Amazing food!!!! The squash dish one of the best things Ive ever eaten! Menu is 75 dont go without adding the fried chicken!!!  Great value for that price with amazing products. 100 recommended! 1010 experience. Except when I rudely asked them for some soy sauce for the mushroom juk and they said no

Hats off to Bulbap for keeping it real large portions, low prices and solid flavors. The Tofu Bites were deceptively flavorful and crisp. The Jae Yuk Bowl could have been spicier, but the creative Galbi Burger was like the gorgeous happa offspring of the most beautiful Korean and American couple you've ever met. Yumdiddlyum! We tried this restaurant as convenient and close option from our hotel. Didn't expect too much since this gem korean restaurant is quite far from actual Korean town. I am so glad that we decided to eat here because foods taste was amazing, the ownermanager looking gentleman was extremely nice and kind with his service. Foods came out super quick and fresh, the portion of Stone pot bibimbap was incredibly great! Supreme galbi burger, as my picture shows it was gigantic, juicy with full flavor!!
Highly recommend here if you are around. And i will definitely come back for next NYC visit. There seemed to be just one waiter, but he was good and very responsive. The food was great. I believe authentic because there were a number of Asians dining there as well. Great experience! We went on a Monday and got seated right away since there was no wait. We were excited to try the highlyrated Korean food and ordered tofu jap chae, janchi guksu party noodle soup, and the bulgogi bowl.

However, we were disappointed that only kimchi was served as a side dish, which is unusual for an authentic Korean restaurant. The food looked nice, but the jap chae and bulgogi bowl were both too sweet and salty, and tasted the same. The party noodle soup was bland.

There was also a lot of noise, banging, and yelling from the kitchen, which was disruptive. The waiter was eating during his shift and didnt seem to care about the noise. We had to call him over several times to get our check.

Overall, I gave them two stars for the food presentation and the portion size, but the noise and inattentive service made for an unpleasant experience. We wont be coming back.

And FYI, they do not offer small side dishes banchan, only kimchi and so little of it! No refill btw. burge bun was hard, owner said it's  supposed to be like that, but it's not. chicken wings were super hard and tasteless. Also, the owner asked us to leave  through the other door, afraid of us telling other customers to go to another restaurant because of the horrible food. He didn't  even hesitate  to fix our bad experience at his restaurant.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Kochi,"652 10th Ave, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.6,40.7619926,-73.9934692,"I was taken here for my birthday, and we had a truly exquisite evening, a sensational, New York dining experience.

Every dish on the tasting menu was well thought out, expertly prepared and beautifully presented. The crew definitely takes the endeavor seriously, and it is reflected in the quality of the meal. I had the beverage pairing, which was also wonderful. All of the Wines or sake were selected with care and accompanied each dish beautifully.

The service was extremely professional and friendly, it was a pleasure to sit at the counter and watch the team preparing each course.

Definitely would like to go back here for another special occasion, or perhaps just a fun evening to treat ourselves. Had an amazing dinner here. I had the vegetarian tasting menu and my husband had the regular tasting menu. We were both blown away by every dish. I was so thankful for how amazing my vegetarian dishes tasted, it was definitely not an afterthought and so much care was put into it. This was the best tasting menu experience Ive had and it was 100 worth it. We left feeling full. I cant stop thinking about the watermelon dish. Highly recommend for meat eaters and vegetarians! Pictures are of some of the vegetarian dishes Amazing service. Food was absolutely outstanding. Every course was surprising and illuminating, some of the best food we've ever had. We paid 476 for two, without the wine pairing. A few notes that the music was quite loud and the wagyu did not come out hot. They also asked us to leave midway through the last dessert course even though we waited more than ten minutes for some of the courses to come out and were not loitering whatsoever. Was a bit surprising. Food really wasn't an ordinary experience. The courses were interesting with fine ingredients, good taste. The staff explained the courses and were flexible accomodating wife's vegeterian preference for some of the courses. The A5 Wagyu upgrade was worth it, my wife and I felt the quality of the meat. We were also very pleased with the extra desert offered by the restaurant for celebrating our  wedding. The deserts were really exceptional. The service was very pleasant.

If I have to nitpick, I think the atmosphere can be improved. I expected more out of a Michelin star restaurant. The place is fairly small, the bathrooms could have been cleaner and taken care of. The place only had to offer metal chopsticks, I believe for trying to make it a fancy experience, but as a person that is used to wooden chopsticks my whole life it came out really inconvenient to hold much heavier chopsticks. Finally getting around to leaving a review. Better late than never.

My wife and I dined here the summer of 2023. We splurged on the chef's table experience and loved it. The food was impeccable, the hospitality was warm and welcoming, and the atmosphere was cozy yet comfortable.

Good hospitality and great food. We said ""yes"" to all the upgrades. Worth it. Flat iron steak to A5 wagyu, black truffle supplement, sea urchin supplement. I recommend this spot to anyone looking to venture North of the craziness in Midtown.","Monday: 5:00 – 9:30 PM

My favorite appetizer is baked blue cheese puff. I like to eat it with the complimentary bread. So so good 

For entree we love prime rib king the size is good for 2 people. The meat is great quality and juicy. Perfect cooked. Mushrooms side is very tasty. It has a little bit tangy favor. I'm really surprised by how disappointing our birthday dinner for 6 was, all around. We've been to several comparable steakhouses, and were excited for Keen's. Service was bad, all around. Our waiter move slowly, seemed grim, and didn't read us any specials, checked in with us once the whole dinner, and was noticeably frustrated when we had to ask for the dessert menu several times. We sat and waited for our food for probably 40 minutes. Nobody bussed our table and plates sat finished for 20 to 30 minutes. When our orders were finally brought, the busboys were confused about who got what. Our order was straightforward.

My cocktail was highway robbery at 19. At that price, an old fashioned should have a large ice cube, not whatever came out of the fridge ice maker. It was straight up bad.

The food was soso below par for a steakhouse of this magnitude. The medium well steak was overcooked.

The sides were great! Desserts were small, but delicious. We had dinner here for our anniversary with another couple.  Our first time here, other couple has been here before so they ordered for us.

We had cocktails, Jumbo Lump Crab cocktail, Thickcut Smoked Bacon, TBone for two and Chateaubriand Steak for Two, Carrots with Brown butter and Mashed potatoes.

The steaks where over cooked a little, but tasty.  The staff was friendly and not pushy.  We were able to take our time and enjoy everything. We dined at Keens Steakhouse and ordered both the steak and lamb. While the steak was good, we both preferred the lambit had a unique flavor and was cooked to perfection. Unfortunately, the atmosphere wasnt as enjoyable due to a loud argument at the table next to us throughout the meal, which made it hard to fully relax. Despite the disruption, the food was excellent, and the lamb especially stood out Keens Steakhouse is absolutely one of the best steakhouses Ive been to in NYC! I went with a group of 10, and the experience was phenomenal from start to finish. The steaks were cooked to perfectionjuicy, flavorful, and exactly as ordered. The classic ambiance added to the charm, and the service was topnotch, handling our large group with ease and attention to detail. Everyone in our party left impressed and satisfied.

There was a little confusion when we ordered corn cheese not on the happy hour menu. The server must have heard something else crunchy tofu? and thought we ordered it on the happy hour menu. It arrived at our table I have a photo of it and we let them know it was not what we ordered.

We didn't touch it and they did take it off our bill, but only after we insisted that it was not what we ordered.

We got a couple of their soju cocktails as well. Both were delicious. Food was pretty good, too. I had such an amazing time introducing my friend to Korean food for the first time here! The menu offered a variety of delicious options, and every dish was packed with flavor. We left feeling full, satisfied, and so happy with our experience. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making it the perfect spot to share a meal. Highly recommend for anyone looking to try unique Korean cuisine! If you want traditional Korean food, this place wont be a good choice. Foods are more like fancy but small portion fusion foods. Overall the taste is a bit sweet. The uni bibimbap is a good choice!

They simply served the food and left. I had to find someone to order. and my 2nd glass too. So I decided to finish for a drink.  But overall was very good for my birthday dinner. Totally awesome atmosphere, chill music and foods!!  Highly recommend this restaurant. I wanna go this place on Christmas.  servers were nice and gentle so I entirely enjoyed my dinner. Thank you  I went there to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and the service was amazing. They are very friendly and very nice. However, the food was a bit salty for almost every dishes. Overall it was ok but we loved the desserts there, it was refreshing and not too sweet.

I would recommend you guys to try it once for any special occasion or regular normal meal. A great meal that lives up to the high cost. Theres lots of different flavors here, the banchan was standout, and we left full. The sake flight was great and unique.

Loses a star though because theres less interest to return given the menu doesnt seem to have changed at all in a very long time. Also kinda awkward that there didnt appear to be any Koreans working in the entire front of house while we were there. A unique experience, ten courses with wine pairing was truly amazing.

Each dish was thoughtfully conceptualized, cooked to perfection, and beautifully presented. I also got the wine pairing and fresh truffle addons, both of which were well worth the money. Its difficult to pick my favorite course, though I would say I think about their japchae every other day. Finally, the service is truly exceptional. The wait staff is beyond professional yet still warm and personable. The atmosphere is very relaxed, which isnt always the case at Michelinstarred restaurants. Truly exceptional. We have done the downstairs tasting seating prior, and it was fantastic, but this review is for the bar tasting upstairs. I had the nonalcoholic wine pairing, and Im usually a bit disappointed at other places, but in this case I was blown away. Each of the dishes or something special and unique, with so much craft and care put into each. The amuse bouche or first course is out of this world. Stupendous  One of the best restaurants I have eaten at to date.
To me, this restaurant is proof that michelin stars system is bogus. I've eaten at 3 star places that pale in comparison to this place.

Pretty much everything tasted amazing. They were transparent about their ingredients. We got the non alcoholic pairing. 2 of the drinks were kinda mid.
Reservations are hard to get
I thought it was kinda expensive at first but after trying it I felt it was worth every penny. 100 would come again given the opportunity. Undoubtedly the best restaurant in the US. 6th best in the world. The title is well deserved. No questions asked. Exquisite service and hospitality. Delectable food selection. We dined at the bar for our special occasion. Atomix is an experience that bears true to passion and love for fine dining. Thank you for raising the standard, for pursuing excellence and for understanding what food represents in the Korean culture. I will absolutely come back again  Such a special experience at Atomix. Chefs commitment to showcasing the very best of Korean flavorsingredients in the context of New York City is so unique and interesting. Each course presented something new and came with a dedicated card from Chef. Love this special attention to detail, so thoughtful!

The soju cocktail I had was delicious and the dessert at the end was amazing! Wasnt a fan of the seafood paella, but my favorite dish by far was the Korean popcorn chicken! Felt a little rushed towards the end, but its a small place that sees a lot of traffic, so I understand the time limits.

Will definitely come back another time and try the other meals we didnt have! Wow Must TRY.

this was the best meal I've had since coming to NYC. The food was somethingelse where every dish was packed with flavours. The resturant was quite hidden but once inside the atmosphere was dark mysterious. I did not know what to expect once inside but when I got the dishes. Man o man ...... My new favorite Korean place! Korean right? Anyway lets talk about how amazing is the mac n cheese, every single bite was glorious. I also had the popcorn chicken, kimchi paella and steak. All of them delicious. Our server was very charismatic and nice. Last but not least, great atmosphere. just amazing. super unique flow in the dark cocktails in a bag. korean inspired and such great flavours in each dish. you really cant go wrong here. very busy so put your name down early. please go here if you get the chance. Wow! This place is AMAZING. Food is spectacular, the service is good and the drinks are creative and fun. If youre looking for a fun experience while dining out, dont miss this opportunity!

Superb hospitality and such an elegant setting. And the quality of the meal was unbelievable  fresh, delicious, so satisfying. Best kimchi Ive ever had? Probably! Service was great, KBBQ was absolutely out of this world. The appetizers were pretty wack and took of a star, but besides that it was wonderful.

We started with the hamachi crudo, which had a strangely extra fishy taste and left a weird taste in my mouth. We also got the galbi dumplings which were disappointing.

The barbecue, however, was outstanding. Even the meats that werent marinated just melted in your mouth. It was AMAZING. Probably the best quality meat Ive had at kbbq in NYC. It was so out of this world.

The restaurant itself was very clean and upscale and the service was attentive. The drinks were great too! I got one with lemon I forgot the name and boyfriend got a mango maksomething? They were fantastic.

100000 would go again, just not ordering appetizers next time. Amazing  I went there by myself so couldnt order more dishes but I had  and it was a full of flavor and lots of baby squid!  I wish we have this restaurant in SF city! Definitely go back next time when I visit NY! Very good Korean barbecue. Seriously impressive how much flavor they pack into their meats, especially the marinated kinds. Perfect for if you have a special occasion and want a welcoming atmosphere. Also the kimchi is amazing. We had an amazing dinner here!

We went for the bbq  with the marinated rib and the brisket. The meat was delicious! We also had the Busan Neighbourhood Pancake  dont miss it!

The staff was also really friendly and nice. The guided us through the menu and giving their recommendations on best dishes, how much and how to eat.

Han Bat,"53 W 35th St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4,40.7502064,-73.9863009,"Quick and attentive service! They had authentic food and everything came out flavorful and hot. Not much wait for a weekday evening for table of two. Passed by the entry of the restaurant and smelled delicious broth  ended up going in to try the food and they did not disappoint!! Came back to our ""spot"" after more than 10 years. The place is the same as it was back then. We were excited to be here. We got our favorites which were still as delicious as before. The staff were very friendly and attentive, and the venue has a warm, comfortable ambience that made the dining experience relaxing. Exceeded our expectations and surely deserves a higher .
For a Saturday night, they were able to seat us without having a reservation. Service was prompt and excellent.
All the dishes came well prepared and quite authentic compared to what I have tasted before in Korea.
The cold noodle and bibimbap were the highlight in all our dishes ordered. Straightforward, delicious Korean food. Both times I went here, the bibimbap had a great crunchy charred texture. The banchan are solid. Lets be honest if youre looking at reviews of this place, youre probably struggling to find a seat at one of its massively hyped neighbors and youre considering Han Bat as a backup option. Its good. I actually like it a bit more than its neighbors. Its a perfectly fine Plan B. Came here with a friend for dinner, and we waited about 30 minutes. Definitely not worth the wait.

First, they seated us at a tiny table that couldnt even accommodate our dishes. We had to place our items on the bar in order to be able to fit everything.

The service also left very little to be desired. Customers who were seated after us received their bonchon before we did and when I inquired about this, the server gave me a major attitude.

As for the food, we ordered vegetable pajun, dolsot bibimbop, and sullungtang . They gave us seafood pajun by mistake and offered a perfunctory apology when we pointed this out. Everything tasted too salty and had no depth in flavor. The bonchon also lacked flavor, and the kkakdooki was especially heinous.

All in all, I would not come back to this restaurant again due to the poor quality in food and service.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:30 PM

I prefer the fried chicken and beer place across the road instead where they have hot table to keep the food hot. Woorijip marries convenience with wholesome food. I picked up food around 10am for lunch and snacks in my train ride.  Many of the trays on the shelves were empty but steadily being stocked. The dishes brought out were still slightly warm from being prepared earlier that morning. Each shelf was marked with date and time prepared for food safety reasons. The flavor and preparation of each dish was perfect and thoughtful. The check out process at the counter was efficient and friendly. The clerk added rubber bands to each of my containers to secure the contents.  I'd go here often if it were closer! Super smart way of having food ready to go. The food was super tasty and worth it. We were able to quickly eat there at a reasonable price.

My only complaint is how little beer there was in the bulgogi. It looks like there's a lot, but the meat is a thin layer that's spread at the top. Various options to choose from. I choose tteokbokki, Chicken and kimbap platter with a side of Milkis. Quick and tasty meal if you are confused on where to eat in Ktown. Will definitely come here again. This is succch a cool concept in midtown and I feel its super convenient for people who commute everyday to work. Freshly packed, ready to eat, premade lunch boxes to go that are also healthy. Theyve got a ton of options to choose from and theres something for every dietary preferences. They dont have a lot of processed food items instead from what I saw it was a lotta protein, greens and fresh fruits and veggies. Their menu keeps changing and every food counter had the time and date each box was packed and until when its good to eat. They have a minimum 10 for card transactions. There were a few tables inside to sit and eat too, nothing fancy because this is more of a grab n go kinda spot. I got the japchae and it was super flavorful.

Gaonnuri,"32ND STREET ENTRANCE 1250, Broadway 39th Foor, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.4,40.7480185,-73.9875983,"Went for the steak omakase for a birthday dinner and the meal was a great experience. High quality meat, great uplifted versions of classic Korean food, and attentive service. Gaonnuri continues to be one of my favourite upscale Korean restaurants I want to bring people to for a good memory. Views with a Side of KBBQ A Feast for the Eyes, Not Necessarily the Palate

Soaring high above the city on the 39th floor, Gaonnuri is a New York destination that blends modern elegance with Korean barbecue traditions. The clean, modern decor and breathtaking panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline make it an Instagrammer's dream. It's the perfect spot to impress a date or anyone seeking a unique dining experience. The service is topnotch, and they've even managed to elevate the KBBQ experience to feel refined and luxurious.

However, the food itself presents a different story. While it's not bad by any means, it doesn't quite live up to the rest of the experience. We opted for the omakase menu, featuring beautifully presented dishes and delightful amusebouches. Despite the stunning presentation, some dishes lacked depth of flavor. Surprisingly, the highlight wasn't even the meat which, to their credit, boasts premium cuts. It was a simple vegetable salad, which speaks volumes. The banchan selection was also disappointingly limited, with basically just kimchi on offer.

The Verdict All About the View

If you're willing to pay a premium for the stunning views and luxurious ambiance, Gaonnuri delivers. It's a great option for a unique NYC dining experience, but don't expect to be wowed by the food alone. While it's certainly Instagramworthy, it might not satisfy your taste buds as much.

In short

Views Breathtaking! 5 stars
Service  Ambiance Topnotch! Feels luxurious. 5 stars
Food Not bad, but some dishes fall flat. Presentation is impressive, but flavor is a 3 out of 5.
Value It depends. You're paying for the experience, not necessarily the food. If that's what you prioritize, it's worth it. But KBBQ purists might be disappointed.
Foodies, especially those with a love for Korean cuisine, may find the offerings underwhelming. The portions are modest as well, so don't go in expecting a feast. Ultimately, Gaonnuri is a place where the food, though decent, takes a backseat to the impressive backdrop. Perhaps the best restaurant Ive ever been in NYC. It was fantastic! Views are amazing! We were treated so well!! We didnt have reservations but we were well accommodated and when a window table got available, they moved us there without us even asking! The food is spectacular, meat is fabulous! We cant wait to go back to NYC to have dinner there again!!!! Thank you for the experience! Great view, but the meat quality was not good.
195 for 7 1oz cuts

Of the 7 cuts, 2 were of acceptable quality, the rest were tough and stringy.  I'm unsure how this  could be but some of our party didn't even finish their meat.

The soup was underseasoned and did not taste like a seafood soup, severly lacking depth.

They did not have daikon wrap and when we asked for lettuce and garlic,  the end of the garlic clove was not trimmed, Kitchen fail.

We had 3 diffrent severs through our meal which made the experience fragmented and less cohesive.

Finally the Value was just not there by any means.  I understand you pay for the view,  but the food in general was inadequate at best.

Would not recommend One of the best Korean restaurants in NYC! Refined, authentic traditional Korean food and delicious dessert. The yuzu creme brulee was too beautiful to eat and tasted awesome. The restaurant has fantastic views and a luxurious atmosphere. I really enjoyed their professional service, especially from servers Chris and May and the attentive manger.",no operation time,"restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment"
SORIMMARA,"2 W 32nd St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.7,40.7473227,-73.9861683,"As a first timer trying malatang, i would recommend this place. Overall nice vibes and i just liked the idea that i get to handpick the ingredients in my own bowl and hand over at the counter where they cook and serve it to you. Although one thing i noticed was the ingredients weren't super fresh so had to take a closer look to find the fresher looking ones..! Anyways the service was nice, very attentive. I don't think malatang is for me.. i just don't really like that weirdly tangy flavor that spice? I don't know how to describe it accurately but i think experiencing once was enough for me. Still recommend, very just lowkey, nice vibes. I recommend the breadsticks tho! Also the fried pork thingy too!! I honestly enjoyed them more than malatang lol As a die hard mala fan, I was hoping to give this place 5 stars. I ordered Mala Xiang Guo to go, and the host was so lost, he didnt know how to help me. For the price I paid, youd think they would add a bowl of rice as well as some sort of protein for free. This place is overpriced and not even tasty. Very disappointing. It was our first time here, and we loved it. The food was delicious. We got the Malatang, it was great. The service was great, staff were super nice and helpful. The manager helped us out when we felt lost. They were very hospitable. Im definitely, coming back! Loved my recent lunch in KTown trying Korean Malatang for the first time.

This was such a fun, experiential, dining experiencedelicious too!

A must try spot for my Korean food fans who havent tried this out yet! They also have a full menu and we got to try their famous Tempura Shrimp.

So basically you choose whatever ingredients you want from the fridge, from different meats, veggies, noodles then, choose your spice level, and if you want stir fry or a soup. This is an unbelievable stir fry dish. A perfect spot to enjoy Kstyle malatang!
The broth is flavorful, striking a great balance between numbing Sichuan peppercorns and fiery chili.
Rose Mala Xiang Guo is surprisingly good. So rich and creamy, making the experience of eating vegetables extremely satisfying.
The creamy shrimp wows the whole table! Each piece is so huge, fresh, and bouncy.
Mala rice ball is a brilliant invention! It is filled with all sorts of ingredients with different textures like crunchy pickled radish, sweet corn, umami seaweed
Love the fried bun too! So crispy and soft at the same time! Will come back and try more!","Monday: 12:00 – 11:00 PM

New Wonjo,"23 W 32nd St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.2,40.747775,-73.9867556,"Came for lunch. The food  galbi and all the many included appetizers were delicious. The service was good, as well as the seating in the restaurant itself. And the lunch special was a great value. What more could you ask for in a restaurant? Ive been told its the best korean barbeque in NYC and for now, I wont deny it. Service was great, food too, everything really fresh and tasty. Fun to eat here. Wonjo is one of the oldest restaurants in Ktown and its apparent with how traditional and authentic their food tastes. If youre looking to come in for lunch you probably dont need a reservation, but closer to dinner it gets extremely busy. We ordered the Wonjo Combo with spicy tofu soup, Dduk Boki, and seafood pancake. The spicy tofu soup was extremely rich in flavor and just an amazing start to the meal. The Wonjo combo itself was a bit smaller than I wouldve liked, but the marinated prime ribeye was incredibly tender, juicy, and just all around amazing. It was definitely the highlight of the combo, but it was a bit unfortunate that the combo was so small. The dduk boki came last and it was great, the rice cakes were very chewy and the sauce was just perfect. Everything we ordered was great and tasted very authentic. The only problems I had were the combo portions were small and our servers completely forgot our rice and forgot to add an item for us, but honestly everything was so good that it makes up for it. I will definitely be coming to Wonjo again and I look forward to trying different things! I thought all the restaurants in Korea town had the same tates when it comes to soft tofu stew, seafood pancake, and hot stone Bibimbab.  However, I found them slightly different from others today at this restaurant.  It was a bit more delicious . More savory and deep tastes.  I would definitely go there again.

The staff was very kind. The location was good to find. However, their dishes and containers were a bit old and chipped, but okay to enjoy the traditional foods. It's all about the charcoal! The meat is excellent quality and all the sides that come with your BBQ meat selection are amazingly tasty. It's not the fanciest joint in Korea Town but it's definitely one of the best restaurants on the strip.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 5:00 AM

Dons Bogam,"17 E 32nd St, New York, NY 10016, USA",4.4,40.7468094,-73.9844803,"I went here for lunch and had the BO Special see photo which is the short ribs. It was solid. It was just very slightly sweet and salty, and came with onions. They also brought out a bunch of additional smaller foods see photo like kimchi, sprouted beans, beef  garlic. I liked the smaller plates a lot. It was a solid amount of meat. It also came with white rice and I left a little tired. One of better k bbqs in NYC, we really enjoyed the meat here. They try to give traditional wooden floor exp which is cool, but it is not the most practical way of getting in and out not to mention I felt bad for the dude cooking the bbq on his knees for inside table. Overall pretty good quality of food, service, and vibe. Reservation recommended for dinner time. The side dishes were all clean, not too strong in flavor, and delicious. We ordered the fresh short ribs, and the meat was clean and cooked perfectly by the servers, making it even more enjoyable. Meat always tastes better when someone else grills it for you!

For dessert, we ordered bibim naengmyeon spicy cold noodles. It suited my taste, but the seasoning was a bit too strong, which was a bit disappointing. I think the mul naengmyeon cold noodles in broth is cleaner and tastier. Additionally, we ordered the lunch special combo with bibimbap and doenjang jjigae soybean paste stew. The bibimbap sauce was delicious, and overall, the dish was flavorful. The doenjang jjigae was mildly seasoned, not too strong, and just right.

The atmosphere was great, and overall, the food was excellent. I highly recommend this place! Fantastic meal. Server will grill all the meat for you and potion it to the number of diners. Only down side, it gets smoky in here and the ac is a little weak. Time to upgrade those smoke vents !! We were looking for a Korean BBQ that allowed bookings and wasnt too overpriced. This is it.

If you dont mind the matter in which the seating works, ie you need to climb into your seat, then this place is great.

The bbq options are extensive, thou more pork options wouldnt go a miss.

The service is a little manic but its what you come to expect in a place like this in the heart of KoreaTown.

We went everyday!

They also do amazing coffee and other food items for breakfast and lunch. Its a must visit! My wife and I grab breakfast here whenever we're in the area. Much cheaper than hotel breakfast and always on point.
We always recommend this place to friends. This has become my regular place for breakfast before work. The breakfast specials change regularly and are a great deal  especially for Midtown!

Hyo Dong Gak,"51 W 35th St, New York, NY 10001, USA",3.9,40.750147,-73.9862159,"I visited from Midwest just for a trip. This restaurant was the first korean restaurant I tried in NYC and it's been already my favorite!! I got jjajangmyeon combo  japchaebapit is served with jjambbong broth. Me and my sister really enjoyed! TLDR If you are craving for KoreanChinese in the city, it'll get the job done. Go for lunch time and take advantage of the combo that gives a small sweet and sour beef with the spicy seafood or jajangmyun noodles.

I had walked by this place so many times so I figured let's give it a try. Price was decent, the interior is a bit dated but let's focus on the food.

Fried dumplings. Standard, crispy almost too crispy maybe lots of filling but what you'd expect. Crunchy, greasy, fatty meat, lots of garlic chives.

I opted for the jjampong and small sweet and sour beef combo. The beef is already dressed which I don't love the sweet sauce in general but it was still decently crispy. Spicy seafood noodles were decent, good wok flavor.

For 21.95, this kind of combo in this area it's not bad. Best Korean Chinese restaurant in ny in my opinion. Their jjajangmyun and jjambbong are amazing and also most of other dishes as well. You cant go wrong with any dishes here If yall havent had Korean Chinese food, what are you waiting for?! I went to Hyo Dong Gak, which is right outside of ktown NYC and ordered their 19 split bowl, which came with a big portion of jjangmyeon and a big portion of seafood jampong.

The noodles were perfectly chewy without being too soft. The jjangmyeon had the right amount of sauce and came with tiny pieces of pork.

The jampong had a TON of seafood including big shrimp with the head on, baby shrimp, mussels and octopus. For 19 you really cant go wrong, thats almost unheard of in NYC!

The restaurant was crowded on a random Tuesday evening, but I didnt have to wait long to get seated and I never felt rushed. The staff was extremely friendly and even gave us small packaged candies to take home with us! I will definitely be back!

Follow me on instagram for more! angiesfoodieadventures A little walk from Korea town proper but the 5 minutes is worth it for the seafood blackbean noodles , flavor is authentic to Korea.

Rib No. 7,"32 W 33rd St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.4,40.7484068,-73.986746,"We were excited to try this restaurant, but unfortunately, it didnt quite live up to expectations. Despite wearing a sweater, the AC made it uncomfortably cold inside. The food was a mixed bag  while the oysters were fresh and the BBQ meat was of excellent quality, it came at a steep price. The seafood pancake had a slight sour note, which was unexpected. Service was another downside. The restaurant was packed, and with only a few staff on duty, it felt like they were too busy to properly manage orders or deliver food in a timely manner. Sadly, this experience didnt leave us eager to return. We are 2 people and order combo for 2come with 2 different beef and  pork belly,  Both beef was delicious, but the pork belly was a little overcooked. Next time i will only order beef,  not combo. It was a vibe. Know u have to spend a minimum of 50 per person. We got the kings feast and it fed 6 people really well. The beef quality was great. We got as appetizers, the beef tartar and cold green tea noodles. Pretty unique. Came in during a weekend night. Atmosphere was nice, though a bit dark on the inside.

The service was great, they cooked the meat for you, and explained the cooking times and portioned the meat for each member of the party.

The food was great. We ordered the large feast known as the King's Feast at the time and the Beef Tartare. Some members of our party aren't fans of raw or rare meat, but they really enjoyed the tartare. It was light and flavorful, and the addition of the pears and seaweed made it taste great. Each cut of meat on the large feast was flavorful, had a nice marinade and felt really high quality.

For the price, this would be a place mainly for special occasions. If you are really hungry, I would expect to spend over 100, though the meat is quite worth it. We had 630 reservations for a Wednesday night via Resy. Two out of six of us arrived 15 minutes early, but they wouldnt seat us until the whole party arrived. Which normally would be understandable, but there was no one else dining at the restaurant at that time.

We ordered

Seafood pancake  I normally dont love pajeon because theyre mostly soggy, but this one was pretty good
Mushroom japchae  surprisingly, I did not miss the meat. It was very flavorful overall, but the portion is small
Beef combo  I cant remember exactly what cuts there were, but there were four different kinds. Since Im pregnant, I had to eat all my meat well done but even then, it was still really good  with the exception of some chewy pieces. The marinade is done very well
Banchan  this comes with the combo, though Im not sure if it comes with all meals because Rib No. 7 is not your typical Korean restaurant. But this might be some of the best banchan Ive had in a while. They put their own spin to some of the dishes, which I really liked. We had fish cake, cucumber kimchi, frozen daikon kimchi, pickled daikon sheets, kimchi, scallion salad, and cold seaweed steamed egg, which was my favorite. I probably could have made a whole meal just of this. Free refills are available but only upon request
Mango cheesecake  this was decent
Matcha cheesecake  lots of matcha flavor, which I liked
Black sesame ice cream  this was my favorite of the three desserts. There was lots of black sesame flavor. However, we found out after the fact that it was 15 for two scoops of ice cream, which is the definition of highway robbery

Overall, it was a great meal but it is pricy, even for Ktown. But I would say its worth the once in a while splurge, or if you want to go here for a special occasion.","Monday: 5:00 – 11:00 PM

Soju Haus,"315 5th Ave fl 2, New York, NY 10016, USA",4.2,40.7469816,-73.9854428,"All the food was delicious, needless to say. Even their service was the best I have ever experienced. Although it is a pity that they only accept Amex and cash, I think that is the rule of the store and everyone should follow it, and they are not to be criticized at all. I have been there 5 times so far and I am so grateful that I have had a good time with my friends every time. Soju Haus is an absolute gem in the city. The ambiance is vibrant yet cozy, making it the perfect spot for both a night out with friends and a more intimate dinner. The food is outstanding, with an impressive menu featuring authentic Korean dishes that burst with flavor. Their soju selection is extensive and wellcurated, offering both traditional and unique flavors that pair perfectly with the meal. You must get the coconut soju cocktailit's refreshing, delicious, and the perfect complement to the rich and savory dishes. The staff is exceptionally friendly and attentive, ensuring that every visit is a delightful experience. Whether you're a fan of Korean cuisine or new to it, Soju Haus is a mustvisit destination. great for large groups and very well priced with large af portions. we ordered so many dishes and drinks and enjoyed them all. my personal favorites were the kimchi radish fried rice, bbq chicken and cheese, and the salmon sashimi. the complimentary rice they serve before 8pm is also deliciousits served with purple rice, anchovies, and an egg! the staff were all so kind and provided all we needed for my friends birthday dinner. ill definitely be back! Delicious food and drinks! Perfect for large groups or enjoy by yourself. We had a party of 4 and loved all the food options. Everything we ate was great and service was fast and friendly. All staff were very attentive and helpful.

We ordered intestines, squid, chicken gizzards, pork belly, and pig trotters. Again, everything was so good! I highly recommend trying them out! They will not disappoint. First time coming to this place with some friends and it was a great experience!  The food was pretty good, but the draw is the different kinds of soju available!

While Im not a big fan of soju in general, there were a few premium sojus that I enjoyed!  The atmosphere is nice as is the service!

See photos of what we ordered! Recommended.","Monday: 4:00 PM – 1:00 AM

Handsome Rice,"133 E 31st St, New York, NY 10016, USA",4.7,40.7447135,-73.9812927,"Eating at Handsome rice was such an fulfilling experience. Its not typical Korean but its rather advanced Kfood that reaches out to greater American market. Ive tried the Galbi, Janguh sea eel and Jeyuk and all of them were great  to be honest the Galbi and the eel were my favorite which were perfectly marinated.

The people who prepared the meals there were great also. They seemed to working happily with such ownership. The chef Kim must be a good employer! haha.

Looking forward to another visit which will be my 4th time for Handsome Rice when Im in Manhattan next time. Oh their banana pudding was a pleasant surprise. Delicious!

Overall, excellent food and experience.
    !  With all of the amazing food in NYC, I always kick myself when I get conned by fake reviews. But thats clearly whats happening here with all of the flowery overzealous reviews saying this is the best Korean food in NYC. I trekked 45 minutes in 95 degree heat to get here and ordered the combination meal, which was inedible. It tasted old, gristly, fatty, sitting on top of fatsoaked rice. The vegetables were from the 1900s. The side of dumplings were nominally better but no different from what you might buy from the freezer at the grocery store. So disappointing Great for a quick lunch. This isnt gourmet Korean food, but its delicious and reliable at a good price. Its a takeout spot that happens to have some outdoor seating  but they dont come out to give you the dish and they take a while to clean their trash so pretty much expect to selfserve all the way. The handsome combo with all the meats is a good way to try everything although the truth is that the galbi is the star of the meal. Id just do that the next time Im there! I usually don't give 5 stars unless it's exquisite taste.
I would give this burger 100 stars if possible.
I like hamburgers. I love New York City's delicious homemade hamburgers so much that I've tried them all.
I found the best burger of my life at Handsome Rice!
The patty that softly wraps the mouth and the grill with fire flavor was enough to excite my eyes and taste, and the fresh vegetables seemed to care about my health.
And the fragrant, crispy outside and soft inside of the French fries captured my heart.

If you are traveling to New York or live in New York, it must be on your bucket list of musttry meals.

I confidently and strongly recommend this Handsome Rice.

Good Luck!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Their food is delicious, but the star is their drinks! Large fruit bowls of anything refreshing! I highly recommend the watermelon. They also have phone charging banks for rent as well, so keep the night going! Watermelon soju  pineapple soju were awesome !!!! Its a must try if you visit pocha.

Also, stir fry beef was absolutely delicious, but the pork dish was very spicy. Celebrated a birthday for my friend here and everyone was exceptional. The servers were attentive and our food was served promptly upon ordering. We had problem deciding what to order initially so we kept asking for more time, and they were very kind to wait for us. They were able to accommodate one of my friends who had a shellfish allergy for the rice cakes by not adding in fish cakes. And they also gave us a candle and played the birthday song for my friend. Vibes and atmosphere was great! Gratuity is already added on the receipt with extra tip on the bottom. I tipped extra for the great experience. We came only for the drinks!! We were just walking around and we found this spot and we LOVED IT!! We came 2 in our staying in NY because it was so good!! We try all of them and our favorite was the Melon!! And watermelon!!!
This place is great for some drinks and a fun time with friends Chicken soy garlic wings was GOOD!!! Its crispy and tender

The water melon soju was mostly ice and not a lot of soju in it definitely

The soup was decent and comforting and not really spicy however it is definitely not enough for 4people.","Monday: 5:00 PM – 2:00 AM

BCD Tofu House,"5 W 32nd St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.3,40.747547,-73.9860578,"Had a wonderful experience at BCD Tofu House! The authenticity of the Korean cuisine really stood out. The side dishes were a highlightfresh, varied, and full of traditional flavors that perfectly complemented the main dishes. We ordered the beef and tofu soup, and it was excellentrich, hearty, and packed with flavor. The tofu was silky and the beef was tender, making for a comforting and satisfying meal. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, enhancing the overall dining experience. If youre looking for authentic Korean food, BCD Tofu House is definitely worth a visit. Ill be coming back for sure! We went to meet our daughter's Mom and Sister there for lunch. This is our first time meeting them and eat at BCD Tofu House. The meeting was great, we greatly enjoyed their company. It was a unique experience eating at the restaurant.  We ordered the Bulgogi combo. It comes with a lot of food. The beef and everything else were delicious. We have great conversations, great environments, and great companies that's to mee equal to great experience. I hope there was a BCD Tofu House in Houston, TX.  Definitely recommend visiting this restaurant in Korean town in NY, City.

Note The restroom is downstairs.  Follow the stairs case... This is an authentic and delicious Korean restaurant chain. They even serve marinated raw crab, which is hard to find in many places. Ive eaten here many times, and every dish is consistently good. However, the prices have been going up quite a bit recently. Other than that, no complaints! A classic Korean spot serving hearty Soon Tofu soup with a variety of banchan options the fried croaker is a standout. The combo option is a great way to try a stirfry and a soup dish. The tofu soup is rich and comforting with silken soft tofu, while the spicy pork we ordered was sizzling hot and wellseasoned. Overall, a satisfying meal, though expect a wait during peak hours. This was an awesome place! There was a bit of a wait, but service was extraordinary fast, which is good because we had to catch a flight. They brought many extra side dishes, all of which were delicious. The food was incredible overall. No complaints. They even had a place to lock up our luggage!","Monday: 10:30 AM – 1:00 AM

Chung Ki Wa,"40-06 74th Street, Elmhurst, NY 11373, USA",3.6,40.746488,-73.891606,"To put it plainly, the food here is not good for the price requested. We ordered the ChaDolbagi thinly sliced beef and the Sandubujigae tofu curd pot stew with seafood. If you order only one meat plate, they cook it in the back. Normally Im fine with this but the beef came out incrediblly overcooked with some pieces totally burnt. The tofu curd pot stew had fairly cheep ingredients. The tofu and seafood were clearly prepackagedforzen. Additionally, the stew had this sour smell that made it unpleasant to eat.

Normally Im fine with low quality food if it is reflected in the price. But these two dishes and 1 service of rice cost is 56 before tip 2024.

The service was fine but not good. We were initially seated and serviced by a kind young lady and gentlmen. However, after the order we never saw from them again. Instead an older lady started to bring out food and got our order wrong. She later fixed her mistake. Then when it came to tipping, they were stringent that we tipped in cash.

Overall, I will not coming back here again. I got off the 7 train on my way home from the beach. First time here . Had the Sweet and Sour Fried Pork about 25 it was enough for 4 people and mostly meat and it was Delicious. Paid 3 extra for white rice. Had a Korean bottled beer for 7. On the side they give you separately potato, cabbage, fish, broccoli. The service was great , professional traditional friendly style. Ill be going back soon . Honestly this is like accidental moment me and my friends had, cause after comeback from walmart we crave some food to eat for dinner and when we decide to go to dimsum place, i saw this place on red light position, then we ask if it's still open? And finally we come to dine in, and the foods are so delicious. Recommended for everybody who looks for late dinner cause they open till 3AM. The rude old lady that works there ruined my birthday dinner.  Payed over 50 dollars for bbq and a soup and she didnt bring out lettuce or dipping sauces that usually accompany a bbq. She got annoyed when I asked for it and when we ran out of lettuce there were only like 6 lettuce leafs she had the nerve to snap at me that  lettuce is expensive ! How rude!!  So after spending 50 dollars for a bbq and soup she up charged us another 5 dollars for another preciois 6 leafs of lettuce. Ridiculous. My friend who treated me to my birthday meal  didnt tip her after her rude service and she wanted to know where her tip was. She can take it out of the 5 dollars she uncharged us.  We will never be eating here again.  Which is unfortunate because I love Korean food and this place is so close to my house I would eat here every day of the lady had not been so rude but there are other Korean places near by I can go to instead. Really enjoyed the food, although wouldn't say it's the cheapest Korean restaurant I've been to. The restaurant is also quite spacious. Re the service, the waitresses were slightly on the colder side, not overtly friendly or rude.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 2:00 AM

Café China,"59 W 37th St, New York, NY 10018, USA",4.3,40.7515713,-73.9858221,"Delightful Lunch Experience.

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Cafe China. And thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The overall experience was outstanding, thanks to the delicious food, cozy atmosphere, and attentive service.

Our bartender, Edward, provided exceptional care, ensuring our lunch at the bar counter was memorable.

The menu offerings did not disappoint. Standouts included the savory Ma po tofu, flavorful purple and white rice, perfectly cooked string beans, and tender shredded chicken with yellow chives.

The spicy cucumber appetizer, however, fell short of expectations. Instead of the anticipated spicy kick and perfect marinade balance, it consisted of fresh cucumbers topped with a few red peppers, lacking flavor and seasoning.

Despite this minor misstep, I highly recommend this place.

Reservations are essential, as wait times can reach 4060 minutes. Our bill totaled 112 for two people, including six dishes and hot jasmine tea  a reasonable price for the quality and quantity.

Kudos to the team for the elegant business card design, reflecting the restaurant's attention to detail.

Our rating  4.55.

Thank you and good luck. Came here for an early dinner a few days ago and from the food to the drinks to the service to the ambiance, this place is amazing. We were helped my Alex who made great recommendations, especially because some members of our group had dietary restrictions. I think the stars of the show for me were the eggplant and green beans, the mapo tofu, and the fried fish! Everything came out hot and fresh. We also had cocktails mine was a Corpse Reviver 2 which was beautifully balanced and tasty.  It complimented the food nicely. My friends were also really pleased with their drinks.

If youre going to dine at cafe china, I would recommend coming with people who want to share family style is definitely the way to go here  Jul 24

Dinner 4 of us

All very delicious food

Service 910 quick but maybe because we are seated near the kitchen. See below.

Ambience 710 maybe because we are seated at  behind near the kitchen and under the stairs but overall the decor are nice. And the place is big inside. Good spot for Sichuan cuisine. Some of our favorites were the Husband  Wife Special tripes, the Fish Blossom and the Curiously Tasty Chicken. The Eight Jewel Rice Pudding dessert was also pleasantly refreshing. It's a decent place for some Chinese and it's a pretty big space so we had no trouble being seated. The food was ok but suffering from the usual pitfalls of being very oily or fatty especially the scallion pancakes. I only got through half of my portion of pork ribs before surrendering to it in shame.
A strange point I had to mention about the shiitake mushrooms stir fry is that it has an ingredient in it that somehow numbs your mouth and leaves behind a strange, dry aftertaste. It's likely I'm just too white for these ingredients but I felt it's worth mentioning for other equally melanin challenged folks who may want to visit.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:30 PM

OKDONGSIK New York,"13 E 30th St, New York, NY 10016, USA",4.3,40.7456944,-73.9853743,"Honestly i have a bit of mixed feelings about this place. Food was good in a sense that I can feel that they use good ingredients and the soup tastes sophisticated . it's just pretty much presentable. But i don't think it's worth revisiting. Maybe i had my hopes up too high. Bit disappointed that there was nothing special about this place. Also the bar seating was uncomfortable. The vibe wasn't like where you can enjoy the time and the food but more like once you are done eating you have to hurry your way out. Just several things that could be complemented i guess. If you are dying to try, check it out, but if not then i guess there are better alternatives out there. Entering a sleek, modern barstyle restaurant, I discovered a culinary delight. Their pork gomtang was just wonderful. Each sip revealed a deep, but clean flavor that paired perfectly with a bowl of kimchi, creating a healthy and satisfying combination.
Despite the upscale atmosphere and Michelinstar quality, the prices were surprisingly reasonable. This place is a true gemhighly recommended for anyone seeking a unique and delicious dining experience! very simple, but good soup. everything is pretty much prepared so service is very fast, they just have to assemble the soup.

the kimchi dumplings are very soft, and had some sort of tofu crumbs inside. they werent my favorite though.

the dweji gomtang is a simple, clear soup, similar to chicken noodle but with pork and rice. its very comforting and the portion is decent. they recommend adding a spicy paste onto the meat but it didnt really pair well with the flavor of the soup. First time!
Ive heard about this place a lot on social media.
Unfortunately I have to say that the rave reviews are somewhat over rated its not a surprise that they didnt get Michelin last year.
I do not have any complaints about the Gomtang. I enjoyed it quite a lot.
But they better watch out for the quality of Kimchi Mandoo. It was over steamed so it became mushy. And I dont know where the over powering spiciness is coming from and it numbs your taste buds so that you cant properly appreciate the Gomtang.
In terms of Maesil aid, I barely tasted plum in it. Mostly tasted like club soda with lemon and mint. At last experience the hype.
Single menu. Also ordered barley soju.
Good but not sure returning.

But overall foods were nice, quite fancy.
I think it's also good to order a la carte menu as well.
I love the moods, and want to visit again! Service was great, their food was delicious. If you order one dish as your meal, I doubt you'll be full unless you get an appetizer. My group of 3 ordered a bunch to share we did 5 dishes to share but only needed 4 in the end.

Highly recommend the soy poached black cod and the braised short ribs. They both come with a bowl of rice.

We also ordered the makgeoli beer. It came in a cup and was a very generous cup. It's just a little smaller than a standard Ikea glass cup

We say outside and they had AC there as well. We made a reservation through the seated app but it didn't seem full when we got there at 6pm. However it did seem to fill up after 3040 min. Loved it at Danji! Its an intimate restaurant but they have great dishes. My family and I tried the tasting menu, which included all their popular dishes plus dessert. Flavor packed and genuinely delicious. Would absolutely go back! See my food instagram sipsandsizzles for more! Really great Korean restaurant! We loved every dish that we tried, from the dumplings to the tofu and the bibimbap. Everything was flavorful and fresh. We sat at the bar and the bartender was excellent. Cant wait to go back! Sooooo soooo sooo good!!! Danji is AMAZING. The food is so filling and each plate is perfect to share between two people. The staff is so nice and attentive, really amazing people.

It is actually really good.  The intestine dishes look crispy and crunchy. I dont eat that personally. All other dishes are quite easy for my stomach even though it is spicy.  I like the pork belly as usual.  Cold noodles are very refreshing.  Drink menu are not too diversified.  Overall a good gem hiding in Korean town The perfect spot for feasting on Korean foods!
The new menu item OX intestine BBQ was superb! Perfectly seared with the right balance of meatiness and fattiness. The giant rice ball was packed with tuna, seaweed, pickled radish very rich in flavors and textures.
Rose tteokbokki was creamy. Love the smoky sausage!
The pork soup tasted really healthy, was comforting on stomach.
The portion of the seafood pancake was generously big!
My alltime favorite LA Galbi never fails.
The naengmyum was so refreshing and perfect for summertime! Ox bone soup, spicy rice cake with ramen, sodduck, , cold noodles are all what I ordered. Tastes great in general. Love 24 hours availability. Music might be too loud. Went here with a friend for a late lunch and loved everything! I'll breakdown my review into three categories

1 AmbienceDecor the restaurant is very nicely decorated with high ceilings, beautiful wood accents, and traditional Korean inspired decorations. It is spacious, clean, and a peaceful place to grab a bite amidst the chaos out NYC outside we went around 3pm on a Friday

2 Food We only got ordered two itemsthe Perilla Kalguksu and the Bibim Naengmyun. Both were delicious and served in HUGE portions. The naengmyun was incredibly refreshing after stepping in from the summer heat, with noodles bouncy and chewy and the broth being not too spicy. The kalguksu was also delicious and rich, and the clams were NEVERENDING. A great bang for your buck, especially in the city. And we got banchan of kimchi and radish kimchi which were also both very yummy

The Kunjip | Korean BBQ NYC,"32 W 32nd St, New York, NY 10001, USA",3.9,40.747736,-73.9871829,"Terrible Service Experience

I've been to The Kunjip before and enjoyed the food, so I decided to give it another try for dinner. However, the service experience was beyond disappointing. Upon arrival, we requested a table for two and were directed upstairs where there was no one to greet us. After inquiring with a server, we were finally seated without any communication. Midway through perusing the menu, a male staff member rudely informed us to wait elsewhere as it wasn't our turn, without any prior indication of a waitlist. His demeanor was unprofessional and unwelcoming. When asked about the wait time, he impatiently instructed us to just order. Moments later, another staff member rushed us to place our order, displaying a similar hostile attitude.

Although the food was delicious, the service throughout the meal was appalling. Not once were we offered any side dishes, nor were our glasses refilled with water. We spent barely twenty minutes in the restaurant, yet multiple staff members approached our table without attending to our basic needs. To make matters worse, before we could even finish our meal, the bill was abruptly presented, signaling they wanted us to leave. As my friend was still at the table, a server immediately cleared it for the next guests.

As we left, the entire staff seemed indifferent, except for the kind receptionist at the entrance. Despite the tasty food, the overall experience was marred by the atrocious service. Mr Song hosted us incredibly well! I couldnt believe how hospitable, kind and attentive he was during our Korean BBQ meal here. The team have been fantastic. I would HIGHLY recommend coming here. Its a must in Korean town NYC!

We will be coming here again from London, UK! I recently dined at this Korean barbecue gem in Koreatown NYC, and it exceeded all my expectations! The beef and meat selection was incredibly fresh, making every bite a delight. The shrimp shumai dumplings were a pleasant surprise, bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. And let's not forget about the kimchi stew, which was comforting and packed with authentic Korean flavors. The service was topnotch, and the ambiance added to the overall experience. Highly recommend this spot for any Korean barbecue enthusiast or anyone looking for a memorable dining experience in the heart of NYC! Good Korean food. Service was great. The free appetizer choices is not as great though. Seafood pancake was good and their cold noodle good too. Dumpling was good too but bit greasy Really reminds me of Koreans' restaurant in Korea.

Raku,"342 E 6th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.5,40.7264891,-73.9866759,"I tried Raku in Toronto before and wanted to see how the one in New York compares.  I got a dipping udon with tempura. The udon was nice and chewy and I really liked the tempura  especially the shiso leaf one. The tempura was not too oily and had a good texture. The dipping sauce was nice as they put the condiments separately and you can add it as you desire. I think the wasabi was mixed with something,  which was not really to my taste.
The staff were fast and attentive and the seating area is nice.
Overall it was pretty good! The best udon I've ever had. The texture of the noodles was springy, chewy, and desirable. The broth was super clean tasting. Such a simple bowl of noodles had so much flavor. I arrived for lunch just as they were opening and was immediately seated. The establishment is small with only a few seats so I would recommend coming early or during off times on the weekdays if you don't want to wait for a seat. After I ordered, the food arrived quickly. The server was attentive and checked in on me to see if food was to my liking. Would highly recommend this spot.  This place makes my must try foods when visiting New York. Came with a few friends for lunch and was extremely pleased! We were seated very quickly outside and got our food in a timely manner. The outside seating was also a bit hot as we only had a small fan.

We got the fried chicken, two soup udons, one yakisoba, and one katsudon. The fried chicken was extremely juicy and the sauce was a nice complement. The udon had the right texture and the soup was very flavorful, some of the best udon Ive had in the city. The katsu was also great, very crunchy and juicy. Overall we had a great experience and would love to come again! The food was just okthe udon is a bit too soggy, and the dessert was just subpar. The service was one of the most unfriendly ones I've encountered. Solid ramen spot. Tasty broth and noodles are extremely chewy and delicious. Meat in the ramen was also above average quality for ramen places. Fried chicken was so great, but maybe a bit under salted as it was somewhat bland. Service was pretty good although you might have to wait a bit for a seat.

One thing to consider is the restaurant doesnt have any air conditioning, or if it does it doesnt work very well. Was easily above 80 degrees in there while eating, and much hotter than outside. Still, recommend this spot for decent ramen at an okay price.","Monday: 5:00 – 9:30 PM

Our visit was absolutely delightful, thanks to the exceptional service provided by the attentive staff. They went out of their way to make our anniversary celebration truly special, surprising us with a scrumptious cake. Along with this thoughtful gesture, we were treated to a meticulously crafted multicourse menu designed to showcase the delicious flavors of the season. It was a truly memorable dining experience that exceeded all our expectations. Overall we had a good experience.
Great cocktails. Good food excellent desserts, meat had lots of nerves, not really tender despite being rare.
There was an error in one of our orders with the kitchen which derailed a bit the rhythm of eating with the other guests but this was corrected fairly quickly and they left the wrong dish to be shared, which was nice.
Our waiter was knowledgeable and helpful. Cleanliness of the table throughout the dinner could have been more regularly addressed.
Fairly priced menu. Pretty mediocre quality thought the pastas were honestly just ok and the value for price was bad. Atmosphere was a bit stuffy too. Thought the risotto was undercooked as rice was not fully cooked. The salad, however, was fantastic. Probably wont be back. Located on the second floor of a hotel past a nice flowery staircase. You have to be seated in the bar area for the martini hour, where there are dining tables and you can order the same dishes as in the dining area. But Id personally recommend foregoing the martini hour the drinks werent that amazing. Meanwhile Trofie Nero had just the right mix of flavors and was delicious. We brought our clients to Al Fiori for dinner tonight and had a lovely time. The food was incredible, the service was impeccable and it was a seamless process to work with the restaurant to get everything set up. Our menus were customized, the menu was diverse and they worked to accommodate all dietary restrictions. The photos don't do it justice  would highly recommend.","Monday: 7:00 – 11:00 AM, 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 5:00 – 10:30 PM

IHOP,"235 E 14th St # 237, New York, NY 10003, USA",3.9,40.7328449,-73.9855568,"The pancakes were made to perfection. I tried all the sauces available on the table 4 in total  with my chocolate chip pancakes  they all tasted amazing.
The scrambled eggs were great, sausages were a little bit over cooked but still tasted lovely. The hash browns were real potatoes  not greasy like all the other ones I have had on this trip.
The staff were friendly enough  gave advice as I was totally overwhelmed by the extensive range on the menu.
I will definitely come here again  if you love pancake, you should too. The crepes were very soggy and were no flavor. The pancakes were extremely dry and no butter was on top of the pancakes. I love French fries, any restaurant I go to I order French fries and this specific IHOP restaurant French fries were disgusting! The tender was overly crispy, it hurt your gums and the sauce it came with wasnt even visible. The French toast was soggy and overly drenched in strawberry syrup, you could even see the bananas. Its seems that the food was rushed and was not prepared properly. The restaurant doesnt have many customers but they take forever to seat people. The restaurant smell is horrible and the bathroom is dirty. Seems like theres only Four staff working plus the however many chiefs are in the kitchen. Last but not least my server Cassandra R was very unprofessional, unpleasant attitude, her aura was disgusting. When I first order a hot chocolate, her face expression was as if I shouldnt be ordering that on a summer day. She made me feel uncomfortable placing any other order. She didnt have any patient while my friend and I was explaining what we want, etc. I dont recommend Cassandra R. And or that IHOP location to anyone, its not worth your money and time. casual business meeting at iHop. Food was freshly prepared. Our server was super friendly with great interpersonal skills. He said hes also a personal trainer and part time modelactor. I accepted his invitation for a free personal training session The server was delightful, kind and effecient.  The host was too.  But our table at booth we sat wobbled uncomfortably like a plane in turbulence, we had to move.  Looking around the options were not much better.  To describe the booths, tables, chairs and building as Run down would be giving it a compliment.  IHOP is a huge corporation constantly building new locations they just dont care about this one apparently. And the kicker 90 for two people for BREAKFAST after tip.  For eggs and pancakes and coffee.  90!!!!!  Nah. I recently visited IHOP and decided to indulge in their pumpkin spice pancakes. Even though Ive had them before, this was my first time really reflecting on the experience. The pancakes were perfectly fluffy with just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and spice, making every bite feel like a warm hug on a crisp autumn day. Theyre a seasonal treat that I always look forward to, and IHOP definitely knows how to do them justice. If youre a fan of pumpkin spice, these pancakes are a musttry!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Super Taste,"26 Eldridge St, New York, NY 10002, USA",4.6,40.7150662,-73.9933358,"We were genuinely surprised by how affordable the prices were. Also the food were very delicious. Standout has to be the chicken dumplings.  Those were some of the best dumplings we ever had! Their fried dumplings were also very good. Their service was super fast, even though it was very crowded inside. Our total bill came out under 20. Visited NY for 11 days and tried to do some research on good affordable eats. This place is my top find. Delicious food at affordable prices and always busy. Stand out dishes, the fried chicken dumplings and pork noodles. So glad we came here 3 times! This is a solid small Chinese restaurant with quite a few good hand pulled noodle soup options and some of the best dumplings I've found in a while.
We ordered the beef noodle soup and the spicy beef noodle soup as well as the Sichuan dumplings. The beef broth was rich and thick with the right amount of saltiness. The beef slices were tender and a good mix of lean and fatty. The spicy level of the beef soup was satisfying but not over the top if you like spicy food. The noodles had good a good texture and were not overcooked. All our items were served piping hot. Prices were just a little high in my opinion, but not unfair considering inflation these days, and the portions were admittedly large.
Our favorite was the Sichuan dumplings though with their spicy sauce and generous amount of fresh cilantro. Delicious!
I'll definitely stop in again next time I'm in Chinatown and craving noodle soup. I'm interested in a lot of other items on their menu, but the dumplings will always be part of my order. Recommended. The Chicken Dumplings were just ok in my opinion. The noodles with beef and hot spicy soup was not spicy at all and they could do better with the beef. The fried dumplings looked really good, if you eat pork then I would suggest that. It is very popular on their menu. Honestly, you go here for the food, not the ambiance or environment. Hole in the wall spot in Chinatown with exceptional food. The fried pork dumplings and the schezuan dumplings are phenomenal . The sauce the schezuan dumplings are soaked in are perfect to mix incover the friend pork dumplings.  Very well priced at 12.85 total for two entrees. Do not expect to find a seat unless you mind sharing a table there are about 56 small tables in a 8 ft by 20 ft floor plan so it is tight. Again, you do NOT go here for the ambiance you come here for authentic superb dumplings and noodles at a very cheap price . Minimum of 12 spend.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:20 PM

Hop Kee Restaurant,"21 Mott St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.2,40.7144074,-73.9990328,"It might feel a bit unsettling to dine in a restaurant located below ground level, but this place was a pleasant surprise with its cleanliness.

The food arrived quickly and was wellprepared. However, be aware that the portions are large and meant for sharing, which can make it challenging to sample a variety of dishes if you're in a small group. For a party of three, I would recommend ordering just three items to avoid being overwhelmed. Best hidden gem in Chinatown! They serve you hot tea the moment you sit! The servers are very funny, sarcastic and attentive.

 CASH ONLY, NO CARDS! Gratuity is included in the bill
 There is an ATM less than a block away.
 The restaurant in in the basement, stairs only, no elevator.
 The foods I recommend

1. Salt Squid with Hot Pepper
2. Peking Duck Served in 2 separate plates, comes with Bao bun  sauce
3. Snails Cantonese Style
4. Sauteed Watercress I knew the food was going to be great, when we were the only white people in the restaurant. Food was excellent. Service was great. FYI, Cash only. 18 tip included on bill. Highly recommend for authentic Chinese food. Only the lobster taste good. The soup, steam fish and dry fried beef noodle all taste blend. Cash only. I'M NEVER COMING BACK HERE!
TLDR RUDE WAITER, BAD SERVICE, AND BLAND FOOD

I've never had to leave a bad review but this was beyond terrible. I've been here a handful of times, mostly prepandemic. But I am NEVER coming back because of the way I was treated yesterday. I have never had to raise my voice at a waiter ever in my life. I have worked in the restaurant industry over 10 years. I ordered the chicken and broccoli, beef fried rice, and the eggrolls. The chicken was dry, and the rice was bland. The eggroll was NOT EDIBLE because it had 3 layers of wrapper and the inside was NOT COOKED. I tried waving down a waiter because I was unsure if we even had a singular waiter for our table. A couple of them saw me but just ignored me. No one came to check on us maybe because we were shoved into a corner and no one could even pass to get to us, no water refills, no asking if we needed anything else. So much time passed I was just waiting to pay the bill so we could leave. Ended up walking towards the waiters since they weren't coming to me. I told them there was something wrong with the eggroll and that we didn't eat it so to take it off the bill. Before even looking at said eggroll the waiter says ""It's good, its good, you don't know how to eat!"" I then go back to my table to grab the plate of eggroll to show him that it is raw. HE DOESN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT! I try to show him the raw dough inside. He says that its cooked noodle. Why would there be cooked noodle in an eggroll?!  He then says, "" We have been open for over 50 years, you don't know how to eat!"" It is wild that he did not even look at it to see if something was off which could possibly happen even by accident. I paid for the other items reluctantly and left in a rage. For being open since 1938, you would think they would have this place running smoothly by now. The food and service has gone down tremendously while the prices have gone up. If you want terrible service, rude waiters, and bland food this is the place for you","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM

The food was absolutely amazingsophisticated, complex, and full of flavor. The restaurant itself was spotless, and the service was topnotch. Chef Lee personally greeted us, sharing his culinary journey, which added a personal touch. Its rare to find a place that excels in both food and hospitality, but this restaurant does just that. Ill definitely be back the next time Im in NYC! I had an incredible experience yesterday. The energy was perfect for a nice summer day in New York. The service was incredible and accommodating. Not to mention the food, absolutely delicious, notably, the spicy lobster, and the coconut shrimp were truly otherworldly. I cant wait to come back and bring friends and family. my wonderful server was Ben and that beautiful human gave me incredible recommendations and was one of the highlights of my experience. Good job team. I spent about 87 including a 25 tip Firstly the staff were super friendly and welcoming. And it was my first visit so they kindly explained the menu and made some recommendations.

I created my own set of 5 by choosing from the menu. Had the Salmon Avocado, Spicy Lobster, Salmon Serrano, XO Scallops  Tuna Poke. Everything were freshly make on the spot. So good! I even ordered a Vegan Set to go!

Its great they also have a Vegan Set that vegetarians can enjoy.

Will definitely be back! Amazing hand rolls! Sat at the bar and got the signature set. My partner built her own set of 5. Some of the standouts were Spicy Lobster, Salmon Serrano and coconut shrimp.

The spicy tuna dip with crispy chips were phenomenal way to start the meal. Highly recommend if you enjoy seafood. Some of the nicest sushi Ive had and super reasonably priced for Manhattan.

My host for the evening was a lovely man from Albania, Sheriff. My steak was perfectly medium rare and the wine recommendation paired perfectly. There is a small area for outside seating on a beautiful night and the staff if friendly and accommodating. From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance exuded warmth and elegance, setting the perfect tone for a memorable afternoon.

The service was impeccable our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive, ensuring every detail of our meal was just right.

As for the main eventthe steakseach bite was a testament to culinary mastery. Cooked to perfection, the cuts were tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. Whether you prefer a classic ribeye or a perfectly seared filet mignon, Royal 35 Steakhouse delivers on quality and taste.

But Id like to say Im surprised by their food portion, the second pic was the galbi we ordered priced 39.99 dollars, there were literally like 10 pieces of beef, this is such a disappointment.
However like I said, their service was fine, they brought a tiny portion after we brought up the topic.
Food was average, just average, we ordered another fried chicken wings I didnt take picture, wings were dry, not juicy at all.
Quite disappointing about everything but the service. The food was amazing, it felt like spending a day in Seoul with a touch of Busan. Loved it! The team, along with Mamamia, was incredibly nice and polite! It was my girlfriends first time trying Korean food, and she was really impressed. !"" Food was excellent, not too spicy. I don't remember the names of the dishes, but everything was just right, portions, flavor. The staff was so friendly! Love this place, can't wait to go back. A small personable restaurant with wonderfully friendly staff. The food is solid but not particularly great. I had the bulgogi which was tasty but not the best cut of meat. The kimchi jigae that accompanied it seemed to not be made from scratch. Wanted to try something nearby since we were staying in the area and it was kinda rainy out.

Decided to check this place out, I was able to make a reservation on open table without any issues.

Service was great and we received our food fairly quickly. Ordered the bulgogi kimchi fries and the soondubu with beef. The fries were very good I liked how crispy they were. The soondubu was also tasty and on the mild side which was fine.

Minetta Tavern,"113 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012, USA",4.5,40.7299881,-74.0007016,"Popped into this New York institution for a solo lunch and it was a worthwhile experience. I got a free glass of champagne for dining solo and ordered the Black Label Burger.

I really appreciated the quality of the meat they used and it was cooked perfectly. It was missing a bit of salt and the bun soaked through but one of the best burgers I have had in the city. The service was excellent and hoping to return to try the bone marrow another time. Divine food, atmosphere, cocktails and dessert. When you enter the restaurant it feels as if youre into an old, luxurious New York jazz club. 100 recommended but make sure to book weeks in advance or else its highly doubtful youll find a table on time. The place is pretty nice with a cozy ambiance, dark and classy decoration. The food is pretty rich in flavor and detailed with ingredients although I felt like for the price you may pay it can be considered overpriced or overrated.
We ordered the steak frites and the minette burger and both were really nice with fresh ingredients and good quality.
The service we got from Luis was 1010, really attentive and charismatic. In general the service is amazing.

Regarding the place, I felt a bit squeezed and with no space to move although every table at the restaurant is the same, the concept of a tavern is a small place with lots of tables and people.

Overall a nice experience. Really excellent food served up in this iconic restaurant. The setting, staff and menu is really good. There was so much on the menu that Ill have to return to try some other things. I went for the big name tickets and I wasnt disappointed.
 The 8.510 Black Label Burger was top notch. The onions, patty and bun blended so well. Id like a little more attention to detail on the bun either fresher, toasted or  coated in some interesting flavour it was just quite plain. That would be fine if it t was leaving space for the flavour of the patty or onions but it wasnt the case. The seasoning of the patty could have been better to really get that 1010.
 The 8.510 Bone in New York Strip was another strong hit. The fat could have been rendered better and there could have been more flavour from the flame but the cooking of the strip was very good. The best part was the peppercorn coating. Sharp and strong  special! Minetta Tavern, an oldfashioned French bistro known for their meat dishes, particularly the burger, the steak, the thickcut bacon and more.

The exterior is quite elusive showing nothing inside. The lightning is dark inside, with a light jazzy music. Upon entrance I was instantly hit with the a buttery aroma. Even when I am not that hungry, the classical conditioning made me salivate a bit.

The rumor is real, first and foremost, they do give lone eater a glass of champagne on the house, freshly and bubbly. Even for one person they gave a big loaf of semi baguette with butter on the side. The bread is chewy, warm, and crunchy on the outside. I do feel the butter is a bit lacking flavor though.

The Black Label Burger
The toasted sesame bun is toasted with butter and tasted moldy sweet, has a bit cottony texture, yet when eaten with meat the meat flavor dominates. The top bun has a lot of nutty sesames, and they are super crispy when eaten. The bottom bun, on the contrary, soaks up all the meat juice and is crushed into a thin layer. Since it is dryaged, the meat patty has a cheesy flavor besides beefiness even without the cheese. The patty is seasoned well, and they put an additional finished touch of salt on the surface. Outside is bit crusty, and inside is all juicy. The tomato is not watery, it has a texture when eaten with the patty and the sweet, mushed, caramelized onions. The pickle is outstanding acidic, juicy, mildly sweet, and has a bit of crunch.

I replaced the fries with petite salad, which was coated with olive oil and salt, not bad and not super. I also had the thickcut bacon, which comes in with 2 pieces. These are thick, fatty, come in on a hot plate so they still sizzle a bit. When hot, the smoked flavor really is prominent, I like when it is a bit cold so the smokeness doesnt compete with the porks intrinsic sweetness that much.

The service is outstanding my waitress is quick and accommodating. The food came within 5mins of ordering yeah mediumrare burger doesnt cook for long lol. I ordered a burger and bacon side but I went home a lot of leftover bacon with a semibaguette, and a stomach full of happiness.","Monday: 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM

Dont let the pawn shop at the entrance fool you once you step through the hidden door, you are transported into a vibrant and exotic atmosphere that sets the stage for a culinary adventure.

The food was absolutely delicious, with a diverse menu that caters to a variety of tastes. Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The cocktails were equally impressive, expertly crafted and perfect for complementing the meal.

The staff at Beauty  Essex truly made the experience exceptional. Our hostess was incredibly friendly and welcoming, and despite the restaurant being packed, we experienced minimal waiting time for our reserved table.

Overall, I highly recommend making a reservation at Beauty  Essex when visiting NYC. Its a delightful blend of fun, fantastic food, and a lively atmosphere that you wont want to miss. I cant wait to return on my next trip. I always wanted to come here. Loved the idea of a guitar jewelry store that opens a door to a restaurant! Super cute!! Visited during restaurant week. The kale and apple salad was really good and I mean really good. I'm a picky eater and usually don't like kale, but compared to the other options, that was the only thing I would get, and at least I'd get my veggies in. It was the best appetizer, and everyone at the table agreed. The salmon was a little on the salty side but tolerable. The chicken dish was really good. And Everyone loved their dessert! I would definitely recommend and will be coming back here!! The food was good, but the overall experience was not. Our reservation was for 845, but we got there early and were given a table right away the table was not in the main dining area. While at that first table, we ordered drinks, then were advised by the waitress to order the appetizers and mains all together, and explained that our order would be phased in 2 courses. While waiting for the food, the table next to us got up and alerted us of a big roach going under our table. The manager moved us into the main dining area immediately. Shortly after moving to the new table, the appetizers and food came all at once. It felt from the start like we were being rushed. After another complaint, the manager comped our appetizers due to the restaurant's error. We also overheard the table behind us complaining about another issue, and they were comped with a couple of shots. The drinks we ordered were a hit or miss the same drink came in too sweet or two strong. Don't think we will be coming back. It seems that the overall quality and service of the place has greatly declined. This place is definitely a vibe! Walk through a small pawnshop like front room, into a dark, sexy space. Food was on point. Especially the steak tartare. Drinks tasty. A must visit. Date night, girls night or just to have a delicious meal. Had a wonderful time in the barlounge area for a quick drink and bite before another event.  Bar snacks were fabulous and the room itself is beautiful.  Special thanks to Jose at the bar for taking such good care of us.

One of the best ramen Ive ever had. Service was excellent, was able to grab a seat at 7 on a Friday and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and drinks. The soft shell bao and all star ramen were definitely our favorites.  NOT WORHT IT. The ramen tastes like liquid lasagna  Very small portion. High prices. You are basically paying for the cutsie bar decor and the ratings on Google. Stay away if you ACTUALLY WANT good ramen. The ramen was alright I wouldnt come back for the ramen.. we also ordered two ramen sets. The Gyoza was alright too.. for the price I expected a lot more but youll find the same meal anywhere else for cheaper. What did Ayana our was the soft shell bao. I enjoyed that. The server guy was super sweet. Joe? He was great.

TONCHIN NEW YORK,"13 W 36th St., New York, NY 10018, USA",4.6,40.7502712,-73.9845225,"I think the food was pretty good but the place is a bit overhyped. The appetizers we ordered, the gyozas and the dumplings were both excellent. Flavorful peppers and juicy gyozas. However, the ramens were just ok. I didn't love the smoked dashi I ordered, and while the tonkatsu was better, it was far from the best and there are plenty of better options in NYC. Also didn't love that they were really trying to get us to leave after we were done with our noodles. I have been so excited to try this place after seeing tik Toks and reviews and I was so underwhelmed and disappointed. I reserved and got in right away. Sat at bar but did not drink..none of cocktails screamed at me. I got lunch special with the salad. And sad to say the salad was the best thing about my visit. Their ginger dressing is very good. I actually asked for more and got a side of dressing to take. The ramen was meh. I added spice but it was not spicy at all. The pork looks like thinly sliced ham you get at the deli. Was not a fan at all. The egg was perfect. Broth ok. Noodles were thick and curly. I asked. For thin noodle but was not able to change it. I got spicy wings to go for my new Yorker fiance'. He actually described them as ""trash"". I had high hopes for this place but left highly disappointed. New York has other ramen spots that blow this place away. Service was good. My new favorite ramen spot in the city. We got here at 8pm on a Saturday with no reservation. We got a table in 40 mins which was shorter than the expected wait time. The service was excellent and relatively quick. The food is so delicious!! We got the mushrooms buns, chicken wings, classic tonkotsu ramen and matcha shaved ice. It was all very flavorful. I look forward to returning to try other items on their menu We like it here ! Ramen and all other side dishes tastes very nice. And since half of our group are vegetarian l, we are very happy that we can have nearly the same menu.
Service is very friendly too. Walked in around 330 pm on a Tuesday and managed to get a spot for 2 at the bar the community table was also available. It was interesting to note that theyve been given a Michelin recommendation for the last few years in a row.
They had happy hour offerings available, but we didnt order any drinks. They didnt have any physical menus and no wifi  this gets tricky for those visiting New York from outside the country!
We ordered 1 ramen and 1 cold noodle dish.
The ramen has a bit of a kick, and its really tasty. It contains cashews, which is not something one encounters frequently in ramen. It brought some nice crunch and texture to the dish. It wouldve been nice if they gave a whole egg in the dish instead of just half though. The cold noodles were better than the ramen imo. They are saucy and creamy and the toppings are just right!
Would recommend going here to enjoy the food.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:00 PM

MáLà Project East Village,"122 1st Ave., New York, NY 10009, USA",4.5,40.7271443,-73.9854189,"Came here on the recommendation of a friend. He made the reservations so I cant share the process. Upon our arrival, we shared that we had a reservation and we waited less than 5 minutes to be seated. My friend came in with crutches so we had to seat somewhere easily accessible for him.

Our waiter was either sleepy or not interested in serving us. The service was very uninspiring. We order our drinks and meal at the same time. Our meal arrived with no water and other beverages ordered.

We both ordered the Mala Dry Pot which was pretty pricey for the portion and quantity of meats and produce. The Mala Dry Pot was filled with herbs and flavors but the semi spicy flavored dish was saturated with oils in the center making the experience a tad unbearable.

They served up purple and white rice on the side to augment the dining experience.

Im hoping to give this spot another try or one of the other MaLa Project spots in the city.

Location is great for two to four people based on the seating options. The atmosphere needs some improving. It's like eating in a cave dark and loud from all the other conversations. That said, the food is good. The dry pot had lots of rice noodle, too much, but worth a try. I recommend the small plates the most With recent disappointments with fried rice, I ordered noodles. I was extremely happy as beef noodles were super delicious. I began to suspect that they added some flavour enhancer  Hot herbal tea was good as well. However, vegetarian dumplings werent flavourful, so I am a little disappointed. Spicy hot pot was flavourful and at the maximum level before being unpleasant. The environment is so cozy and it smells amazing throughout the restaurant. Server was very attentive and knowledgable. Did the little spicy Veggie bowl. it was a lot of food so be sure you come with too hungry. Perfect and a truly delicious meal. I had no idea the restaurant had so much decorative space in the back!

The dry pot was very tasty and filling.
The little spicy still made me sweat, so I cant imagine how much the Very Spicy must be!

All the meats and veggies were perfectly cooked into the noodles and sauce. Will definitely try it again!","Monday: 12:00 – 9:15 PM

서래마을 뉴욕스테이크하우스,"95-11 Banpo-dong, Seocho District, Seoul, South Korea",4.5,37.4978952,126.9977778,"New York Steakhouse delivers an exceptional dining experience that truly transports you to the heart of Manhattan.

The cozy atmosphere, combined with its cheeky interior design, creates a setting that feels authentically New York. From the moment you step inside, you're enveloped in a warm, welcoming ambiance that makes it easy to settle in and enjoy your meal.

The service is topnotch, with attentive staff ensuring that every need is met promptly and courteously. The menu selection is perfect, offering a wide variety of dishes to suit any taste. What stands out is the inclusion of sides like salads, soups, desserts, or coffee with every meal, adding incredible value to the dining experience.

The quality of the food is excellent, making the pricetoquality ratio almost unbeatable.

My only minor critique would be the burger meat, which had a bit too much pepper for my liking. However, this small issue did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the meal and steak!

Overall, New York Steakhouse is highly recommended, and I definitely plan to visit again. Whether you're looking for a casual meal or a special night out, this restaurant is sure to impress. I really liked everything about the restaurant. I expected their steak to be original and ""retro"" which was what I got. But out of the two dishes, one meat had a certain smell. I assume that it was not as fresh as it should be. Otherwise, it was a lovely dining experience. I tried this restaurant for the first time and I can say that the quality of the meat is high.
I tried the steak with Aioli and it remember me the taste of south of France. The aioli was creamy and well seasoned.
The steak, tender and juicy.
The service is fast and the waiter really polite.
there is different kind of steaks with different prices.
You start your journey by a pumpkin soup and then your main dish arrives. I also tried the fries and they were crispy and soft inside.
You finish your lunch or dinner by a dessert either a creme brulee, a coffee or a mango jelly. I tried all and everything was good.
The restaurant is well located, clean and for three people we didnt pay a lot compare to other steak house.
For sure, I will go back because everything went well. The steak was very good. The service was not nearly as good as the steak. The waiter and chef are not very aware when it comes to allergies and the ingredients in their foods. After saying they understood that we had a person with CoeliacCeliac disease and another with a sever egg allergy, they brought us salads with bread and a mayonnaise based dressing. After returning these and moving on to the steak and sides, they brought out fried onions with mayonnaise on top.
It is a small almost cramped space. The prices are good, especially considering the neighborhood and quality of the food.
Disregarding the allergy issues, the service is still not very good. Old plain steakhouse at Seorae village. valet parking available.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 3:00 PM, 5:30 – 10:00 PM

And Nobu Downtown has a beautiful bar and lounge area! It's a perfect place to sip and snack while catching up with friends  Came here and got lucky to sit at the sushi bar. I got two rolls of the vegetable sushi and tofu new style. Tofu new style was so bad. Just no. The vegetable sushi was so good. It was so fresh. I also got the donuts also very good. The lychee martini was delicious as well. Service was good but a bit slow. The interior is beautiful as well. Such a nice time. Went to Nobu for my birthday dinner and ordered the Omasake with winesake pairing. All the plates were not only stunning but unbelievably good, I couldn't pick a favorite amongst them. If you are not so much of a drinker I would order just one wine pairing instead of two, for us it was a bit too much alcohol per plate but overall definitely worth it! We had a wonderful experience at Nobu downtown! The food was delicious, and the staff was very friendly. My favorites were the black cod miso and crispy rice with tuna. The sushi was fresh and delicious. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here and highly recommend it! Have been to a different Nobu location before but this one had the most beautiful space Ive ever seen for a restaurant, especially the upstairs portion. Whole place is gorgeous though.

Service was 1010 as usual with Nobu and most dishes were amazing, but the cost  value is why Id say 4 stars on the food.

Overall a really incredible experience and would definitely return. Id especially recommend for any business related purposes.","Monday: 11:45 AM – 2:15 PM, 5:30 – 9:45 PM

Per Se,"10 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,40.7682178,-73.9828988,"We have been to a few two and three star restaurants that did not live up to our expectations, but Per Se did. The food and service exceeded our expectations. When we first were seated at our table overlooking Columbus Circle, the hostess pointed to a small stool and said, ""This is a rest for your purse."" This small touch tells you about the attention level in the restaurant. Each course was perfectly timed and bursting with flavors. The sizes were perfect. By the end of the dinner we were full but not stuffed. And then came six or seven tiny desserts. At the end we got a bag with tasty morsels as mementos, as well as a menu of what we had signed by the chef. It was a memorable dinner. This was an excellent experience. The service staff was phenomenal. They were very professional and friendly. They helped guide us through the menu and ensured our dietary restrictions were not a concern at all.  The main dining room and 9 course tasting menu comes  with a hefty price tag but it is worth it. The food is excellent and you will certainly leave full but not stuffed. This was one of the best meals we have had to date. Walking through a mall to get to a 3 Michelin Star restaurant is off putting but the view once you get there helps you forget all about that. I'm very happy we had the opportunity to eat in the main dining room and next time I am in New York I will do my best to get a reservation there again. Definitely add it to your must eat list when visiting NYC! When you book at a Michelin 3 Star restaurant expectations are pretty high. Especially when you fly in special to New York for your wifes milestone birthday.

Could it be that good?

The short answer is yes.

Amazing view. I couldnt believe our table overlooking Central Park.

Wait staff. Totally matched our vibe. Attentive, funny and the right mix of leave me alone with a hint of answering questions and lightheartedness. Shoutout to Eric!!!

The food. Its all about the food, right? Upon the first bites in your mouth you wonder what youve been chewing your whole life. It certainly wasnt this. I have the palette of a kindergartner and even I was blown away from the flavors, textures and sensations.

To top it off a few special extras for my wifes birthday. Worth the special trip.  Couldnt imagine having done anything else. It's spectacular, it lived up to it's reputation. It's a seven course tasting menu, although if you count the number of desserts it's more like 11. We both had the wagyu supplement which we would highly recommend.

We have done a number of Michelin three starred restaurants, some deliver and some disappoint. In New York Per Se and Le Bernadin are both extraordinary. We were really underwhelmed by Jean George. This place is so hard to review. Obviously the cooking is at a worldclass standard, but aside from a couple of dishes like the classic oyster and pearls and the quail. Nothing really blows you away. The eight or nine different desserts is a nice touch at the end and theres some real crackers in there the thing thats most surprising about this place. Is that the atmosphere the decor feels like a Hilton lobby. Which when youre paying 400 a plate feels very underwhelming, Ive definitely had better. Michelin star Dan experiences and I would not say this is a must do.","Monday: 4:30 – 8:30 PM

Kuu,"20 John St, New York, NY 10038, USA",4.4,40.7097829,-74.0089113,"Its my second time coming here. The service isnt the best but not the worst. I had the Spicy Tuna Tartar and the Kuu chili. I love my broth spicy and temperature hot but it wasnt either.  The spicy tuna tartar wasnt bad. I like the crunch it had. I enjoyed it and its a small place so come early. The food was excellent, really appreciate the chef!!! But unfortunately the service was really bad, three minutes after she sit us down she was rushing to take the order, ask some questions but didnt answer them and after we were done eating about to pay with card and then saw a percentage from 20, 22, 25 to 28 like after a bad service and still want a least a 20 tip? Just from serving two cans of drinks and two dishes? Dont take me wrong I usually tip 10 alone if it is a good service but really caught my attention how high the percentage are in here. I recommend paying in cash if having a bad service I was craving some ramen so I dropped by and Im so glad I did! I didnt realize there was a happy hour that was starting in 20 minutes so the staff member let me wait until then before I put my order through. For 19.99 I got a drink, salad and my miso veg ramen. It was definitely worth the price and tasted delicious. The salad dressing was so good and I got the yuzu turmeric drink. Would definitely recommend if you are in the area I ordered a Sesami chicken Don for takeaway at 1215 pm on May 10, and what I received was far from satisfactory. The attached picture speaks volumes a measly three pieces of chicken adorned a plate that once held a generous portion. This glaring reduction in quantity left me utterly disappointed. It's evident that the quality and portion size have taken a nosedive since my last visit. Sadly, I won't be returning to this establishment again. Save your time and money for a place that values their customers' satisfaction. I cant stress how amazing the service is. My water was never empty, the food came out quickly, and everyone was so polite. I wish I lived in NYC so I could make this one of my regular places. Food was fantastic. I got the pork ramen and the broth is very good.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 9:30 PM

After seeing the Empire State Building,  we googled best restaurant nearby and they did not disappoint. One of the best steaks I ever had and we are from Texas. Great wine, atmosphere and service. The porterhouse that we got was cold and tough. It looks fine when you look at the outer part of the steak but the inside was cold and felt like it was not even cooked thoroughly. Although we did say we wanted the steak to be medium rare, it felt more like rare but cold.

The overall service was ok but didnt exceed my expectations as this is the fine dining steakhouse in nyc.

The atmosphere was great though. This Park Avenue steakhouse is Wolfgang's original restaurant and our favorite of all the locations, mainly due to its history. The ceilings are beautiful, and the servicefood is topnotch like all of the other Wolfgang's locations. I know I've said this before, but Wolfgang's absolutely make the best steak sauce that we have ever had! My family and I ate here on Mothers day for dinner. One of our waiters came off super rude at first and did not look happy to serve us. He was hurrying to pour our seltzer water it almost knocked our glasses over. Food came out fairly quick which was a plus but when we got home 4 of us were super ill the following night coming into the morning, me included. We all had nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, and body chills.. we realized had food poisoning from this meal.

The lobster roll was succulent and flavorful, the steamed lobster was cooked to perfection, and the lobster bisque was rich and creamy. Each bite was a taste sensation! The quality and freshness of the ingredients truly shine through. If you're a seafood lover like me, this place is a mustvisit. Don't miss out on their mouthwatering lobster dishes  your taste buds will thank you! A friend of mine brought me to Chelsea Market for the first time. After walking the Market, I said I wanted to try the oysters. While he went and got sushi, I got the oyster sampler which was one each of the dozen they had available today.

They provided hot sauce Tabasco? and mignonette sauce. Loved the oysters although two were a bit salty for my liking.

I would have liked to have a placement card so I could identify which was which.  This would be particularly helpful if I had been inclined to order more.

There was a size vs salinity chart which was interesting but not if I didnt know which I was tasting.

Great atmosphere and service. We werent rushed and were able to sit and visit a while. Highly recommended for any seafood lover! I like to come here for the sushi bar and and watch the chefs prepare our oder at the counter. I also like to come for the Maine lobster rolls loaded with fresh lobster. The big shrimp and oysters are also excellent. They also have some other unique seafood creations that I like to try. This place has a wide variety of options and a fun seafood market vibe. FOOD surprisingly good.
 Shrimp Katsu Sandwich actual shrimp in there, not so crispy but decent. Needs more flavor and greens.

 Lobster Roll very good one, loaded with lobster. The lobster is fresh, juicy and not fishy, bun is also soft and buttery.

 Clam Chowder not the best clam chowder and a little salty but it's not bad.

SERVICE all self serving, it's a busy place so take awhile to get the food.

I loved every course they served, except for the final chocolate bites. The vibe and service were definitely worthy of two stars. While the portions were on the smaller side you might not feel full at the end, youll absolutely appreciate the unique flavors of each meticulously crafted dish. FOOD best tasting menu restaurant I ever had. Dishes have a really good balance, great layers of flavor in each course, amazing presentation. For the first time ever I love all the courses  on the menu.

Dessert was a very fun part to eat, love the idea of micro ice cream cone, dry ice crunchy bits with passion fruit.

DRINKS long list of drinks to choose from plus wine pairing.

SERVICE top notch service, open kitchen with chef cooks everything in front of you and serve. The waiter takes care of drinks has great communication and really fun.

VIBE very upscale yet not too formal, the dark grey interior does give a cold and heavy vibe in there. Was there end of August in their new location. You are no longer seated at a chefs table and instead at individual tables.

Overall, the food was fine, but not outstanding. One of the desserts tasted freezer burnt. There was no bread course. Nothing stood out.

As far as service, at some point during the meal it smelled like intense smoke to the point I had to step outside. I believe this was for the meat course but they need to figure out a different filtration system a friend also had this same experience when they went. First of all, I have been to many restaurants around the world, up to 3 Michelin stars. This restaurant tortured my tongue. The whole menu was an extreme dose of salt and sugar. I can't believe people write good reviews about this pretentious restaurant. This was by far the worst food I have tasted in my life. The service was good, but the food made my tongue feel like pickle. If you care about good food and not pretentious horrible presentations of salt and sugar, stay away. We loved our main waitress and the staff. However, I must say that that one of the staff was not niceprofessional. It was not a problem for me, but multiple of my guests were not happy about him.

Unsure if he is the manager or owner?

We ate every last bite of both of our plates and look forward to coming back and trying more of their items. Place gets very busy even during early hours and for good reason. The place is cute, walking distance to good shops and of course the food is good.

Service was quick but maybe not the most friendly. They were not unfriendly though but just kinda lacking like meh lol not necessarily a complaint but rather just an observation. anyhooo, service was also prompt and orders came in correctly. Pancakes were verrry good! light, fluffy and delicious with great syrup! Avocado toast was nice and filling and the juice was refreshing!

I can see why its an easy goto place for a lot of people and glad we were able to try it out! 4.3 stars. Nice location. Good food but nothing noteworthy. We had a variety of dishes including what looked like a chicken salad, hamburgers, sweet potato fries. I had a breakfast bowl with eggs and greens. It was good. The grilled Brussels sprouts stood out. Food

These are my reviews on the things I ate, not what was all ordered as I came in a group.

Fries with Truffle Aioli
Crispy and had a good potato consistency. Not much taste to the fries even with all the seasoning. Sauce gave a good kick to the fries, which was much needed. The sauce, though, tasted just like ranch.

Crispy Brussel Sprouts
Brussel Sprouts weren't too soft or too hard, a good medium. Dressing and herbs gave a good mix of taste, barely noticed the quinoa. Dressing all fell to the bottom and soaked the bottom leaves, leaving them to be very salty and hard to eat.

Ruby's Ragu
Braised Beef had a strong kick to it, well seasoned. Mixed with the sauce, the beef became a little too salty to eat on its own. The pappardelle pasta was cooked al dente. The pasta didn't soak up any of the sauce taste. it definitely needed the beef with each bite. The burrata didn't really add much, but it did help with the taste for the pasta.

Bronte Burger
Ciabatta was toasted just fine. It wasn't too hard but definitely wasn't too soft. The meat to slice ratio was a little off. One slice had a lot, and the other slice the meat was barely there. The slice without a lot of meat caused it to slide around after each bite. There was a very herby taste to each bite with the meat. Spinach and tomato were just the right amount to not overpower the burger or cause it to be too big. Sweet chili and mayo were only tasted during bites without the meat present.

Iced Tea Peach

Was unsweetened tea with peach flavoring. The flavoring gave slight hints of peach, not enough to be considered as peach flavored. Did come with a slice of lemon.

Place

Consisted of outdoor and indoor seating. Outdoor seating was a little hard to sit, as it was on the street the terrain wasn't flat and level. Indoor seating was slightly cramped, but there was enough room to eat comfortably. Was sat on the side of the kitchen. With that being said, the air is not cool enough inside to have an open kitchen. I was sweating through the entire meal without feeling like I was cooling down. Nice place but needs more air.

Service

The host was very nice, and our first 2 waiters were as well. We originally sat outside, but we asked if we could be moved inside as we were having trouble with seating on the uneven terrain. The host was kind and allowed us to switch inside. Our waiter helped us move our utensils and menus inside. The second waiter came out to take our order and was very attentive to what we were saying and answered all our questions kindly. Though it did take around 10 minutes of waiting before we had our order taken. Our third waiter wasn't as kind as the others. We were wrapping up our meal and empty dishes were on the table, without saying ""excuse me"" or any kind saying, the waiter just snatched dishes and cups out of infront of us and reaching over the table as some of us were still dining. When we finished eating and were given the check and a take out box, the waiter just dropped it on the table.

Final thoughts

The being a quick meal, it was enjoyable. It could have been better but was a decent enough meal.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Our dishes came out as they were cooked. The soup dumplings were amazing. I also got the shrimp with a delicious fruit sauce. Everyone was very happy with their meal. It was busy and a lot of people were waiting, but we were able to get in pretty quickly. Shanghai 21 is an absolute gem in New York Citys Chinatown! I had an incredible dining experience here, and its definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants Ive visited. The restaurant has a cozy, inviting atmosphere, and the service is quick and friendly.

We started with their famous soup dumplings, and they were outstandingperfectly steamed with a deliciously savory broth inside. For the main course, we ordered the General Tsos chicken and the spicy beef noodle soup. Both dishes were packed with flavor and authentic spices that made each bite unforgettable. The portions were generous, and everything was reasonably priced, especially considering the quality of the food.

Overall, Shanghai 21 offers delicious, authentic Chinese cuisine with great service in the heart of NYC. Ill definitely be coming back to try more dishes. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Chinese food or is looking to explore Chinatowns culinary scene!

Enjoy your next visit to Shanghai 21! I had an incredible experience at Shanghai 21. The food is spectacular, especially the shrimp dumplings, which were the best Ive ever had. The quality and flavor of the dishes are exceptional, and the service is equally excellent. My wife and I were very satisfied with our visit. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Chinatown. Five stars well deserved! I highly recommend their Crab meat and pork soup dumplings! I go here just to order them. The shrimp dumplings are also a favorite! The wait isnt too long either  the longest Ive waited for a table was about 2030 minutes. Staff is friendly and attentive. Such amazing food! I recommend the General Tsos chicken over rice. The variety of the menu is great. They also have delicious dumplings. I would come here every day if I lived here!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:30 PM

Delivery came fair time. Packaging was fantastic.
Food was still warm. Half half with potato deep in rose ddeok bok ki was heaven.
Egg sandwich was new style. I had a plain egg sandwich and came in pretty near closing. The food was incredible, and the person working even brought my friends sandwich to him as we sat outside even though we were going to pick it up inside. He also brought us some complimentary Korean sweet tea, which was absolutely delicious and a very very kind gesture. The prices are amazing as well, I highly recommend visiting this place! my girlfriend and i really enjoyed our time at Korean Street Foods! the owner was very very friendly  funny, We tried the Crispy Hotdog and it was magnificent!

ROBERT,"2 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,40.767438,-73.9819871,"Last Sunday, my friend and I had a wonderful dining experience at the Robert restaurant. Each of us had an appetizer, a main dish, and a dessert all dishes were absolutely delicious, and the presentation was fantastic.

A complimentary amuse bush and mini dessert cakes were also a nice touch.

The service was good and unobtrusive. I was a bit surprised that we were seated at the small corner table while plenty of other tables were available. The seat was not very comfortable, as I was hitting the wall with my elbow all the time, but the view compensated for this inconvenience. The view from the window is absolutely stunning. You can see Central Park and Broadway from above, and it compliments the bright, modern interior of the place. I am definitely will be coming back here. I recently visited Robert Restaurant located in an art museum close to Central Park during my 2day trip to NY with guests. The ambience was fantastic and the service was topnotch. Our server was very informative and helpful, especially with guiding my vegan wife through the menu. We all had a great time and I would definitely recommend this place to others. It's a perfect spot for dates and business dinners. Overall, a wonderful dining experience at Robert Restaurant! Such a great spot for brunch and gatherings with the view of Central Park. Took family from out of town here and they loved the experience. We were able to grab a table by the window around lunch time on a weekday  I think those tables are first come first serve. We got the prix fixe lunch menu plus two sides shishito peppers and lettuce wraps. I really liked the chicken  it was done so well, juicy and well seasoned, the salad was also great. Wasnt too impressed with the lettuce wraps. But I would definitely come back again  they even brought out a cute dessert to welcome my family to NYC! We actually made the reservation to celebrate my mom's and my birthday, we requested a reservation by the window. Upon arrival Matthew the host greeted us but sat us in a place where we had no view of absolutely anything and offered us another table in an area where no one was enjoying dinner, he had a table by the window which he said was reserved but the truth is that they always had a table available all night near the window and they did not want to seat us there, he never consulted the manager at the time to see what they could do nor did he make any attempt to please our request. Francisco also did not make any effort to try to change the situation until the end which seemed a little annoying to me since he was aware of the situation but he only offered to move us when we were going to order dessert which I found super offensive, we waited around 20 minutes for them to collect the main course plates so we could order desserts. The food is very good but the service is very bad, especially on special occasions, on a Monday, when they may have about 10 reservations for the whole night. I do not recommend it. The server Moises and his server support were the only reason we stayed to enjoy dinner. We were a 60th birthday party of 6 and the last time I was at Robert was 10 years ago. It was divine back then. What happened? And full disclosure  I m a foodie who worked back of house in a fancy restaurant like this  but I maintain, food doesnt have to be fancy. It just has to be good.

Halibut  at 39  was criminally overcooked  resembled a dry chicken breast. You cannot serve one of the most premium fish varieties like this for that price. My friend and I were so dazed and confused by it as we traded bites we didnt think to wake up send it back  and we should have. It was clearly left to sit and overcook.

Branzino  ok, filleted was good sans bones to worry about. But this fish works better a whole fish  because unlike say, buttery Chilean sea bass, it has that stringy snapperlike texture.

Risotto  way too small.

Sea scallops  3 on a plate and 1 overcooked at over 10 bucks a piece.

Desserts  were a total, unmitigated disaster. We shouldve just gone to Van Leeuwen across the road. While we appreciated the birthday dish of 6 squares of red velvet cake and a cream cheese frosting  the desserts proved they need a dedicated pastry chef. The pistachio brle was like a bad childs kitchen experiment. The blackberry cheesecake  more like a mauve mouse  just didnt work. The brownie was just a brownie.

The only thing that was very good in the whole evening were the crispy fries and the 49 fillet steak  and it would want to be at that price.

The server Chris  a brilliant photographer by the way  tried his best, was diplomatic to a fault  and really sold us on the desserts. As he should  this is a business. But the kitchen let him down.

I know how difficult is to run a business particularly a restaurant, but it astounds me how these kind of mistakes can happen at such a highend location with very high rent. At this price point, you have to be good. I dont like to see businesses fail, but with this lack of attention to detail   which seems to stem from not visiting even casual excellent restaurants like C as in Charlie, Jun Men, Genesis House, Little Rubys for their short rib pappardelle  to experience the standard being served  a place like this would be doomed. It is lucky it is more of a touristtype restaurant so probably benefits from getting a stream of visitors from outside New York. But the fact that it was half full and they still managed to overcook the fish   maybe that says everything.

If you come perhaps order the 26 vegan zoodle  dish, 2 of the appetizers in lieu of a main and maybe a vat of the mushroom soup amusebouche will save the day. They cant possibly mess those up.","Monday: 12:00 – 10:00 PM

YUBU SoHo,"46 Grand St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.8,40.7226434,-74.0039152,"YUBU is a small Korean restaurant located in SoHo specializing in the tofu pockets its name is based on.

The atmosphere is like a smaller cafe, with many smaller tables sprinkled throughout the restaurant and quick and efficient service. The menus are plastered on the walls as well as at the counter, so it's easy to determine what you want.

We tried the Bulgolgi, Pork Jaeyook, Spicy Chicken, Spicy Tuna Mayo, Seared Salmon, and Spicy Salmon Yubus. The rice was compacted into the tofu skin wrap, with it being a bit mushy and easy to fall apart. However, the rice ratio to the toppings was good, and the flavors overall was pretty decent. The spicy ones weren't too spicy, but still had a bit of a kick. It was 25 for 8 of them, so decent price for the portion and number you get.

Overall a great place to grab a quick bite in SoHo. it was awesome! the service was amazing and it had a nice clean interior. the only thing that could use some work is the rice ratio the rice is definitely really compacted in there so it can be a little mushy. the toppings were amazing and well seasoned! The rolls are incredibly delicious! I decided to order a few for lunch after trying them once, and I was instantly fell in love. I had to come back and order more. The spicy salmon is my favoriteabsolutely mouthwatering! Highly recommend this place for anyone. Loved it! It could have a pinch of salt to elevate it, but nonetheless it was really good. Loved the crabstick! And the strawberry iced matcha latte is to die for! Love honest business that is generous with the toppings cause look at that strawberry stacked!! Didn't feel shortchanged or whatsoever. Yummy and well priced! 10 for all 3 of my choice. Lovely environment and lots of seating when I was here. Only thing is  they have a no laptop policy. So not a good place to work or study. But to meet up with friends  yes","Monday: 10:30 AM – 7:30 PM

Golden Unicorn,"18 E Broadway, New York, NY 10002, USA",3.9,40.7137006,-73.997193,"This restaurant has a long history and is wellknown. They offer a wide variety of dim sum and Cantonese dishes, with many being quite good. However, since the menu is extensive, not every dish stands out equally. It's best to focus on their signature dishes recommended by the staff. Additionally, their service is professional, and the spacious dining environment enhances the overall experience. Very fancy Chinese restaurant
In our case the food was nice and tasty
The only thing we did not like it is they do not have baby changing pads or any space for it.
My husband got the pork with Pekn spice and he really enjoyed  it
I had rice with veggies  and it was really  nice
The portions are big
The tea in the table it is exquisite The very best dim sum in lower Manhattan. Golden unicorn has been a sought after lunch destination within my family since I can remember. It is a vast plane of tables being constantly circumvented by carts packed with the most delicious dumplings. There is always space yet never empty. The rice noodles are transcendent and the pig buns are as cute as they are delicious. Dont let any new spot fool you, this 1996 top 5 restaurants in nyc NEVER disappoints. For Chinatown in New York, which should be the pinnacle, the food was only fair. Shrimp seemed slightly undercooked and didnt taste strictly fresh, and the sticky rice lacked flavor or many discernible bits of sausage. Shu Mai were good. Service was pleasant, and I liked the old school ambiance and cart service, especially where they fry your dumplings tableside. Google suggested there might be a wait on a Saturday afternoon, but I got right in., A nice spot in Chinatown. We didnt have to wait on a Friday evening. The food was really good here! When we went, there were only dim sum dishes available and a few options off of the normal menu. The chicken was delicious. The buns and dim sums were quite good. The staff is friendly. In terms of interior design, there is a little much going on.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Mari,"679 9th Ave, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.5,40.761534,-73.9906541,"

WORTH IT 100
Best tasting menu Ive ever had.
Mari is a Korean hand roll tasting menu restaurant with a Michelin star
They offer a 13 course tasting menu of street food inspired Korean hand rolls
three appetizers, 7 hand rolls, 1 main course, and two desserts
Every course we had was absolutely delicious!!
The tasting menu is 145
If you can sit up at the counter I highly recommend it, it was such a experience seeing the chiefs prepare and present each course in front of you
It was worth every penny
Service was also very good

Truly one of NYCs best restaurants!
Would 100 come back!! This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC! Ive been here many times for dinner since it opened a few years ago. The food is amazing, delicious and creative, and the restaurant is great about changing up the menu periodically. The craft cocktails are also great. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is well designed. I highly recommend dinner here its one of the best tasting menus Ive had. I have lived in NYC for 16 years and this just entered my top 5 restaurants in NYC and my top 2 favorite asian restaurant toss up with Rule of Thirds in Brooklyn.

What makes a great restaurant? Food, Flavor, Presentation, Service and Mari excels at all.

The pacing was perfection. We never felt rushed and never felt neglected. We always felt attended to and never felt like we were pausing.

The courses come out efficient and perfect temperature. And they just keep coming and coming.

The flavors albeit maybe a hair salty are PACKED with flavor. The spicy tuna could be my favorite bite of sushi.. EVER. It was so good and without diluting it was the most elegant spicy flaming hot cheetos crunch ever on top.

The desert  which usually is an afterthought  was equally up to the task and the presentation was impeccable.

Yes its pricey but if you paid by plate its way more reasonable than you realize. Will def be coming back. Everything was so good! Their tasting menu is such a good deal  145 for 13 course meal. Every dish was beautifully executed and scrumptious. Staff was very nice and accommodating. It was also great to see the open kitchen where chefs were thoughtfully making all the dishes. I recently visited Mari restaurant in New York City and had an unforgettable dining experience. We indulged in a 13course dinner that included three appetizers, seven main courses, and two desserts. The array of Korean hand rolls was absolutely amazing, each one crafted to perfection. My favorite was spicy tuna hand roll.

The servers were outstanding, ensuring that every dish was meticulously described, enhancing our appreciation of the meal. The ambiance of the restaurant was serene and inviting, adding to the overall enjoyment of the evening.

My whole family had a fantastic time, and we especially loved the tasting menu. If you're a fan of Korean food, Mari restaurant is a mustvisit.","Monday: 5:00 – 9:30 PM

Our group was made up of 19 people, we would all go back and bring more friends. The service the food and atmosphere were outstanding. I absolutely LOVE coming here with my children! The food is amazing and enough to share. They even advise you to order one plate per 2 people because the servings are a lot. The service is great, and the atmosphere is beautiful. I try to go at least once every year. Great experience definitely be back. The plates serve 23 people so its great to go with a group order 3 plates and share them all. I had the fettuccine Alfredo, which great however it needed a couple minutes at rest to thicken up when served it came out a little soupy by after a couple minutes it was thickened. The staff was super attentive which I appreciated, they did not rush us whatsoever and they were very friendly. Thanks! Traditional family style Italian restaurant. The ambience is great and the platters are meant to be share, good enough to feed 2 or 3 people. Overall, a good place to go before catching a play or if you are staying close to Times Square. Make sure you make a reservation as the restaurant gets extremely busy. Great restaurant  must visit. Delicious food, very large portions 1 plate for two people. Pleasant atmosphere and staff. Yes its is crowded and noisy as everywhere in NY and you need to book a table in advance, but this is clear, because it is the best Italian restaurant in New York. Prices are nice.

The Modern,"9 W 53rd St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.6,40.761081,-73.976753,"Simply exceptional in every category. This was one of the few experiences where I didn't provide any constructive feedback at the end of my visit.

Sam, Isabel and Gabe and the entire team provided a comfortably elegant experience. Seated at a table overlooking the courtyard I was able to view the entire dining area as well as hear the beautiful energy coming from the Bar Room.

After a brief consult with Sam we opted for ""Abstractions"" with the paired wines. This turned out to be an exceptional choice.

Every dish and every wine proved to be a beautiful symphony of flavors  simply sensory perfection. What an incredible and unforgettable dining experience at The Modern. From the moment I walked in, I was warmly welcomed and made to feel like the only guest in the entire restaurant. The level of service was exceptional, with every detail attended to with care and attention. Despite my dietary restrictions, the staff ensured that the tasting menu was safe for me and tailored to my needs.

As for the food, it was truly exceptional. Each dish from the tasting menu was perfectly portioned and impeccably presented. The duck and the cheesecake ice cream were standout highlights from the Impressions menu. Every bite was a burst of flavor and creativity. The experience was well worth the investment, and the opportunity to dine inside the MoMa only added to the overall enchanting ambiance. Eggs on eggs on eggs was worth the hype, easily one of my favorite dishes in recent memory. Other than the duck dish fell flat, everything was to our liking. Cocktails were delicious, especially the espresso martini. We had an early reservation and the restaurant was fairly empty but filled in part way through. Part of the meal was done outside in the garden which was nice. I booked the Kitchen Table and it was an incredible experience. The food was absolutely amazing and you left feeling full but not stuffed. The atmosphere was very fun and it was unique to see all the chefs in action. This experience was worth every penny and was right up there with any 3 Michelin Starred restaurant. The staff made us feel very comfortable and it was a very enjoyable experience. We had dietary restrictions and they were able to accommodate with ease! If you are able to get a reservation for the Kitchen Table or the dining room for the tasting menu while in NYC, do yourself a favor and book it!

Family Meal at Blue Hill,"75 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,40.7320465,-73.9996685,"The food was good but nothing impressivespecial. We did the wine pairing which was a huge mistake, it didn't go with the food at all. Honestly we should have known the wine pairing wouldn't be good since the chef changes the menu each day based on what's fresh hence it'd be difficult to get the most optimal pairing. The servers also didn't know anything about the wine.

Overall, the food is fine but not good enoughunique enough to justify the price. Truly exceptional, but didnt we know that already? They customized vegetarian meals for me and dad while my partner ate the freshest fish and meats to his hearts desire. They truly know how to make ingredients sing. We also had the wine pairing and I dont know when Ill have wine like that again nothing hits the same anymore. Cant wait to make a trip update to the farm one day  Blue Hill in Manhattan is a wonderful place that I'd love to visit again.
 Their farmtotable concept is simply amazing. They started with a restaurant in upstate New York and now have one in NYC too.
 What I really liked is that their veggies are grown on their own farm, and the meats and fish are provided by their partners. You can taste the fresh difference!
 The interior has a simple yet classy vibe, with lovely flowers adorning the space.
 The food is served as a mix of different dishes in a fourcourse tasting menu.
 They did an excellent job accommodating my dislikes and allergy requests.
 The staff is incredibly attentive and friendly. Had an absolutely lovely evening dining here. Food was delicious and the staff were wonderful. Not even sure where to start with the food but every dish was delightful except the crudite, it wasn't bad but I could've done without it. One of my favorites was the bread they served. So soft, so warm, I could've eaten that all day. I was absolutely stuffed by the end of the night. Sometimes you're afraid that you'd leave these Michelin starred restaurants wanting more but nope, not here. A great place for a classy yet homey meal. Overall, the entire experience was more on the disappointing side. This is not our first time dining at a ""locally sourced ingredients"" establishment or a Michelinstarred place. We also tried not to leave any food uneaten, knowing that the products were locally sourced, but this does not reflect our thoughts on the dishes.

The meal started on a fun note with different types of cucumbers paired with a green dip that was quite delicious. However, from that point onward, the main course was disappointing, despite the theme of the lunch being French brasserie.

The salad and ratatouille were nice, but the mussel dish tasted bitter due to the sauce, and the steak and potato plate was quite dry and rubbery. I've had similar dishes many times before, so it wasn't an issue of trying them for the first time.

As for the dessert, it was a large donut with apricot filling. It was served without any utensil to cut it, which might have been fine. However, the donut itself seemed to have been sitting out for a whilethe bread tasted oily, and the filling inside was unfortunately quite sour. Even my partner, who usually enjoys all types of desserts, did not enjoy this one.

Lastly, regarding the service, everyone was friendly, but given that it was a menuless place, we would have appreciated some explanation about the dishes without having to ask about each one.

We are not sure if we'd like to return to this place, although we might give it another chance since the menu changes seasonally. However, it's a big maybe for now.","Monday: 5:30 – 9:00 PM

TAO Downtown Restaurant,"92 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.3,40.7425376,-74.0038464,"I must say this place is extremely nice. The vibe and atmosphere of this spot is insane. Our waiter was extremely patient and nice when he was explaining how things worked and what he recommended so props to him!
So during happy hour, the bartender wasnt too friendly which was unfortunate when I was just waiting around for my group of people to arrive.
Dont get me wrong, the food was great. However, it did not wow me. The Asian cuisine overall was good but for the quality I can definitely get that somewhere else for half of the price. But hey were paying for the experience, service and all the other factors.
First time here and I would recommend coming to experience everything they offer. If youve been here before, I wouldnt recommend so much.
All in all, had a great time! 910 The vibe in this place is amazing! The lighting is very minimal, which makes the meal so pleasant. They also used wieghted glasses, also nice. The fish was so fresh, and the tuna just melted in your mouth. We sat in a booth, and it was so comfortable, with soft velvet. The staff was very nice, and multiple people came to check on us throughout our meal. You should also get a reservation, that way you can actually get a table. This is a very unique experience in NYC. Go try it out for yourself. I recently celebrated my birthday at Tao, and it was an unforgettable experience! The ambiance was absolutely stunning, with its chic decor and calming vibe, creating the perfect setting for a special occasion. The menu was filled with a wide variety of delicious dishes, each one more flavorful than the last. From start to finish, the food was exceptional, and the staff was attentive and made the evening feel extra special. If you're looking for a place to celebrate or just enjoy a great meal in a beautiful setting, Tao is definitely worth visiting! This place atmosphere is truly unmatched. So many places for great pics and amazing memories. Service is also elite. Didnt go for a special occasion but this place would be amazing for that.  The food was also great I enjoyed it a lot dont think Ill get the duck Again but only because the other options are so good. I had a great time good drinks and great vibes will definitely recommend It was my first time coming to this location as we had a great time at the Midtown location and it was an excellent experience as we enjoyed a Birthday celebration with exquisite food and company to match. The appetizers we shared were scrumptious and the staff was extremely accommodating as we had some other first timers in the party. The Waygu melted in your mouth along with the vegetable fried rice and the Duck was good especially with the shrimp tempura. So if you are looking for a trendy space in Manhattan then visit this location.","Monday: 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM

Her Name is Han,"17 E 31st St, New York, NY 10016, USA",4.5,40.7462496,-73.9847616,"Her Name is Han offers a small lunch menu of classic Korean meals, but what they do, they do very well. The flavors are wellbalanced, and the quality of the ingredients are solid.

I loved the cream croquettesthey were a highlight of the meal. However, the fried chicken was average and not something Id recommend. The bulgogi hot pot was also a bit too sweet.

The set lunches are generous in portion size and can easily be shared, making the prices fair. The service was also excellent, adding to the overall great experience. Visiting NYC for work and this place came highly recommended and did not disappoint. Definitely grab a reservation as this place was poppin on a Thursday.

Service was great and super chill. Table went with the Korean Fried Chicken, Pork Belly and Fried fish. Definitely get the sesame ice cream, make room for it
All dishes were excellent and will definitely come here again when I visit again for work. I went there twice with friends and my boyfriend. We very impressed on the marinated shrimp and every dishes that we ordered is so delicious. We would love to go back again and try other things. Highly recommended to check it out and make a reservation might be better so you dont have to wait. Visited for weekend brunch and thoroughly enjoyed the set menu  the Monkfish  Mussel Sujebi was comforting, creamy, and garlicky  perfect for a cold, rainy day, with just the right portion size. Another standout was the black sesame tofu, featuring soft tofu topped with a rich and refreshing black sesame sauce. The menu offers a modern take on Korean cuisine, and overall, it was an enjoyable dining experience with great flavors and friendly service. I feel like my biggest issue was the portion sizetoprice ratio. Ive had bossam with much larger serving size and the same price in many other places. However, I like how everything on their menu tastes clean and nongreasy at all. The raw marinated crab was delicious. The service was good. The ambiance and restaurant itself was cozy.  But will I come back again? It was worth a trip to try once, considering all of the media attention its gotten lately. But most likely wont be coming back.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:20 PM, 5:30 – 9:50 PM

Buddakan,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.4,40.7423312,-74.0049692,"It was my first time at this almost 20 yearold Asian fusion cuisine restaurant. Why did I wait so long to enjoy one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Despite its age the restaurant looks and feels brand new. There is a slight scent that reminds you of being at a fancy spa. The decor is sleek and very attractive. The service is attentive and helpful without being overbearing. The food arrives and you understand why this restaurant has not only survived but prospered in the difficult New York City restaurant scene. We started with the chili rock shrimp and the short rib and scallion pancake. Both dishes were just marvelous. We then moved on to another beef dish and ginger scallion chicken which did not disappoint. We also had the lobster fried rice which was pleasantly sweet and enjoyable. To cleanse my palate I had the coconut tapioca pudding. It was light and tasty just what I required to finish a wonderful experience. Just one final note, they keep it rather dark so you'll need to use your phone lightflashlight to read the menus. Ive always wanted to dine at Buddakan since I heard Martha Stewart talk about it on her show years ago and I finally got my wish when I went to celebrate a friends birthday. The food was excellent and deserves a Michelin star. The Royal cocktail was delicious. Our server was fabulous. I havent had excellent service like that in a long time. Our server was so helpful and pleasant and treated. Buddakan NYC is a hidden gem! The atmosphere is stunning, with a chic and modern design that sets the perfect backdrop for a memorable meal. The staff was welcoming and attentive, making us feel right at home.

The food was absolutely incredible! We tried a variety of dishes, and each one was bursting with flavor. The Black Pepper Beef  was the highlight. I also loved the creative cocktailsthey really complemented the meal.

Whether you're looking for a special night out or a casual dinner, Buddakan delivers on all fronts. I cant wait to return and explore more of the menu. Highly recommend! Hands down one of the classiest dinner experiences we've had! The ambience in this place is something else... simply gorgeous! The food was excellent! We loved the dim sum tasting for 3  the shrimp and carrot dumplings were the best! Loved the fried rice, the broken chili chicken, and the sweet and crispy jumbo shrimp! Everything was delicious, and the service was good too! Fantastic food and the general ambiencevibe was great.

Our server which I did not get the name of, did a fantastic job making sure we were good all the time despite being quite busy. He recommended everything we had from our preferences and we were very happy! Very professional and helpful.","Monday: 5:00 – 11:00 PM

Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse,"1221 Ave of the Americas, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.5,40.7594099,-73.98222,"I recently dined at Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House in New York, and it was an exceptional experience. The NY Strip steak was absolutely delicious, cooked to perfection with a wonderful sear and tender, juicy interior that true steak lovers will appreciate.

To make our anniversary even more special, the staff generously offered us a complimentary slice of their rich and creamy cheesecake, which was a delightful surprise and a testament to their excellent customer service.

While the prices are on the higher side, they are quite reasonable considering the high standards and quality one expects in New York City.

Overall, Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House delivers a memorable dining experience with superb food and attentive service, making it well worth a visit. I have been there twice in the past 6 months. The first time was in March. That experience led me come back again in September 2024. When I visited the first time, I wanted to have a nice meal and a wine just before I left NY. Bartender Dan was kindly advising me a meal that is not in the menu but was fitting perfect for what I was looking for. He then paired it with one of the best red wines I tasted. This welcoming, attentive and friendly experience led me to visit again in September. Unfortunately I learned that Dan passed away since the last time I saw him. I am very sorry for his absence and I wish his soul peace. His skilled colleagues keep the place in check. I will always visit this place to honour his memory. R. I. P. beautiful soul. Del frisco is definitely different from what it was a couple of years ago and I now understand why it's very easy to get a reservation at this place.

They have plenty of tables available even on Friday evening.  They have a couple of staff who look like managers and will only take care of the table on rare occasions. Servers do not introduce highlights of their menu or make food drink recommendations any more.

Now for the food steak is okay. I like the fact that they have a fattier cut. But they tend to overcook. It's also under seasoned.

Overall, I was not impressed by my latest experience at Del Frisco's and this place would not rank as 1 NYC given where they're at right now.

For tourists, honestly, the halal food truck just outside of the steakhouse is even more worthy than visiting here. I dont come here as often as I'd like but went tonight with my daughter to celebrate my upcoming 50th birthday. Menu had new items such as sushi and octopus. Both were delicious. The dry aged steak I had was to die for. So much flavor and so tender. Our waiter, Gerard G was fantastic. He was so attentive without being pushy and his recommendations were on point. I will ask for him whenever I visit. That's how much I loved his service.

Took food home and had the new hibiscus cheesecake to share. Last but not least was a take home order of their lemon cake because its always been one of my favs.

Yes, it's pricey but worth it. Treat yourself, you wont be disappointed. I like the lobster, crab cake and rainbow salmon crab sushi roll very much. The chicken, scallops are not good for me. I like the happy birthday cake gift ","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Soogil,"108 E 4th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.6,40.725625,-73.9883417,"Came with a Korean foodie friend and we both ordered the 3course tasting menu plus some additional side dishes. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable and thoughtful and the chef also met with us and provided additional information on the dishes we had ordered. Beautiful experience. I visited this restaurant during New York Restaurant Week and was thoroughly impressed by the 60 dinner. The food was thoughtfully prepared and artfully presented, with each dish resembling a work of art. The diversity in ingredients, flavors, colors, and textures was remarkable. The chef's creativity and craftsmanship shone through each delicate dish, delivering one delightful surprise after another. A good chef knows how to keep diners engaged with the unexpectedit's like an intriguing dialogue.

The restaurant itself isn't very large but has a unique, chill, and warm East Village vibe. The comfortably dimmed lighting enhances the intimate and relaxed atmosphere, making it the kind of place where you just want to sit all night, sip wine, and watch the world go by through the window. This is one of the restaurant I would recommend.  Fusion of French and Korean cuisine.  What surprise me is the duck breast.  Skin is crispy and meat is so tender but not too raw and chewy.  Perfect    The beef tartar  blend in so well with fried seaweed and crispy rice.  Scallops with Korean melon pure is so delicious.   The Wellington beef is also well prepared. Came on a Tuesday night 813 and must say we really enjoyed the foods here but unfortunately was ruined by couple of hit and miss inexperienced servers. They were three servers on the floor that night which should be adequate for a weeknight crowd. What bothered me the most was the lack of  basic fundamental knowledge about restaurant service. The first server who came to our table to take our order looks confused and even unable to answer some simple questions about the dishes on the menu. To make the matter worst a different server who open the wine bottle we ordered was just as ignorant. He just popped the bottle and serve it to everyone and drips all over the table as he pours. No bottle confirmation, presentation, pour of taste and so forth. At this point we just want to order and finish up our meal dinner then leave, let alone enjoying the meal but then came a server name Fin. An energetic, knowledgeable, attentive and very experience young man with a positive attitude. He went through the whole menu with us with a very professional manner. It was like a day and night. He stopped by our table periodically to check on us to assure we have a great experience dining there. We learned that through our conversation that hes only been working there for about a month. To the owner and manager of the restaurant, we really enjoyed the foods here but the service truly needs more than just a polish. Hats off to Fin Tried this place for the first time a couple weeks ago and it was absolutely amazing. I always worry about going to places that have the smaller portions but by the time we left, I was pretty full. We did the chef's prefix menu. Everything that came out was so fresh. The food combinations were an explosion of flavor, each with their own uniqueness. Even my picky eating friend was willing enough to try everything and for the most part liked it all I would find it impressive if a picky eater liked foie gras.  We had a group of 5 of us so we were able to try a little bit of everything. The halibut just melted when you took a bite was a pleasant surprise consider it tends to be a tougher fish. They bring out the whole beef Wellington before they cut it so you could see the golden goodness and then they cut it into portions to serve with a side of veggies. It was cooked to perfection. The duck was also good, I'm running out of words to emphasize how delightful everything was. The drinks were also very good. The sorbet for dessert was light and a perfect post dinner treat. The chocolate cake was the perfect balance of sweetness. Lastly, get the uni app. You will not be disappointed. I cannot rave about this place enough.","Monday: Closed

Shukette,"230 9th Ave, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.7,40.7471546,-74.0005218,"Incredibly delicious food, with flavors perfectly arranged on the plate. After visiting many places and trying their food, some better than others, this one will remain dear to our hearts.

The atmosphere was relatively nice, but the music was a bit too loud, so everyone had to raise their voices slightly to be heard.

Its worth noting that both the place and my thoughts on the atmosphere are purely personal. A popular Mediterranean themed restaurant in lower Manhattan. Very tough to get seated without a reservation. Food was ok probably not my favorite mix of flavors. We tried a few different dishes and my favorite was probably the eggplant. The shawarma fries were surprisingly very flavorful without being overly salty.

They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating which is great in warm weather. Booth seating inside was very uncomfortable. I think its worth a shot to try this place but I probably wont come back We celebrated my birthday here! The place is usually super popular, but we were able to make reservations on the day of my birthday.  We ordered a bunch of small plates that we shared and it was more than enough. The cherry dish happened to be one of my favorites. The music was good,  but not too loud and we were able to sit outside. Shukette in New York City is an absolute gem for Mediterranean cuisine lovers. From the moment I stepped inside, I was transported to a warm and inviting atmosphere filled with the aroma of fresh herbs and spices.

The menu offers a delightful array of traditional dishes, each prepared with care and attention to detail. I started with a perfectly seasoned hummus, served with warm pita bread that was soft and chewy. The main course was equally impressive  I opted for the lamb shish kebab, which was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender. The flavors were bold and authentic, showcasing the restaurant's commitment to using highquality ingredients.

The service was impeccable, with our server being attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The ambiance was cozy and relaxed, making it the perfect spot for a leisurely meal with friends or family.

If you're craving a taste of the Mediterranean in the heart of New York City, Shukette is a mustvisit. I highly recommend it! everything was phenomenal. the bread is a must with any of the dips. we got the hummus and it was super smooth and creamy. we also got the eggplant featuring a sweet and spicy component. divine. the main was the scallops and they were honestly the highlight. melted in your mouth. the tahini soft served tbh wasnt great but everything else was amazing. would recommend.","Monday: 5:00 – 11:00 PM

Club A Steakhouse,"240 E 58th St, New York, NY 10022, USA",4.8,40.760051,-73.965573,"I took a business associate, plus one other, for dinner at 'Club A Steakhouse' when in New York and the whole experience was first class.  The ambience and greeting on arrival was great, as was the decor and vibe.  A great menu with some top quality dishes to choose from and impeccable service from our waiter.  I was also impressed by the fact that the restaurant owner, Bruno, was in the restaurant talking to, and serving, guests... A nice touch that was appreciated, a very lovely man and one that deserves to have a successful restaurant such as Club A.  I had the Shrimp Cocktail, the NY Strip, with sides of Broccoli, Creamed Spinach and Onion Rings, shared with my dining partners who both had the Chilean Seabass.  Everything was delicious and to a very high standard.  We did not order dessert but Bruno presented us with a dessert sampler platter and all of the desserts were amazing.  The costs for the meal was US294 including tax but before tip which was reasonable compared to other American Fine Dining Steakhouses I have eaten in over the years.  I can't recommend 'Club A' highly enough and I take my hat off to Bruno and his whole team for providing such great ambience, service and food.  Thank You. My partner and I have dined at Club A several times over the years. We decided that Club A is the best steakhouse in NYC. 
The restaurant is beautiful, the service is always pleasant, great cocktails, great wine selection, and the food notably the steaks are excellent. The complimentary dessert is always a nice touch!
A great spot spot for a nice dinner. 30May2024...We celebrated my 60th birthday here. The food, the service,  and the attention given to us was awesome! The picture of the table at the end was an amazing touch! The ambiance was so good. The fried calamari was delicious. I highly recommend the mac and cheese. The filet mignon was perfect! B The best steakhouse for us as a couple  My favorite restaurant I found on my first trip to New York  I went to 5 or 6 stores and chose this one, and this one was a big hit  Not only the taste of the steak, but they will also recommend wine that will go well with the dish. The service is good, and the staff are smiling and kind  Inside the store, live music is played at a moderate volume and the atmosphere is good. This is one of the stores I definitely want to visit when visiting New York  Club A Steakhouse

Sea Fire Grill,"158 E 48th St Between 3rd and, The Buchanan, Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.6,40.7546919,-73.9722216,"My fiance and I were in the area and were looking for a great restaurant in NYC. Decided to call to make sure we could get last minute reservations for the two of us. The staff was very friendly and we were lucky enough to be able to get a table despite it being restaurant week we had no idea!. The atmosphere was elite, and the food was exquisite! Our server Dennis made great recommendations and he along with the entire wait staff went above and beyond to make sure our experience was phenomenal! The food was so good that Im already looking forward to coming back the next time we are in the NYC area. FYI there is no valet parking but there is a garage directly across the street from the restaurant for easy and safe parking! I've eaten there a few times and the food was constantly good. I was there this time for the happy hour. They served east coast blue point oysters, which were better quality than I expected. The glass of champagne was nice, too. The service is good. They greeted me very warmly upon me sitting down at the bar, which made me felt welcomed. I just went there for restaurant week and wow. Food choices were great, and the service was even better. The atmosphere is modern but is still warm and cozy. Staff is so polite and friendly and on point. I'm definitely going to return to this restaurant even though I'm not a fan of going to Manhattan. I went here during restaurant week.  They had a three course meal for 45.  It wasn't crowded but it filled up slowly.  They seated us right away.  We ordered bib salad, octopus, calamari, squid ink pasta, salmon, branzino, steak, tiramisu, mango sherbet and cheesecake.  Everything was cooked perfectly and they were nice size portions.  You know it's good when four people eating a three course meal cleaned their plates.  Not a grain of rice was left.  Definitely going back. During a second visit, the Sea Fire Grill, situated in a prime location, once again promises an exceptional dining experience. Before taking your seat, a visit to the bar is a must. Their drinks, especially the Avalon Invicta, are topnotch. Enjoying colossal shrimp with traditional cocktail sauce is a delightful treat at the bar. Timmy, the bartender, is the besthe makes you feel at home with his courteous demeanor and extensive knowledge of various drinks.

Once seated, the main course options truly shine. The squid ink pasta featuring fresh Maine lobster stands out for its delightful flavors. Equally impressive is the salmon served with black rice, complemented by Brussels sprouts with sweet and spicy Marcona almonds. For dessert, the cheesecake with blueberries offers a perfect conclusion to the meal.

Overall, I highly recommend the Sea Fire Grill. The elegant decor and impeccable service further elevate the dining experience. I'll definitely be returning for another delightful meal.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:30 PM

Nobu Fifty Seven,"40 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,40.763705,-73.9762452,"Went to Nobu 57 for their 30th anniversary special. Upon arriving on time, we were told that our table wasnt ready yet. After tables have been set up, we thought it would be omakase experience by the bar but were sat on table. Which was totally okay. The issue was, they were quick to get our orders but the time it took for 5 dishes to arrive took a lot longer than expected. There were gaps as long as 30 minutes just waiting for the next course. The staffs were very quick to remove the finished plates off the tables but for the next menu to come out there were numerous awkward time gaps between. The guests next to our table left after being upset. We managed to receive all our menu and took us about 2 hours. The staffs did apologize every time our dishes came out but still was not something I expected.

Worst part is when they come out with the dishes and explain the menu, you cant hear them even though they are right next to you. The music sound and restaurant noise made it impossible to hear the explanation. We just ended up nodding our heads and eating and guessing. Reminded me more of a bar due to the loud noise and music.

Food was good but wait time and atmosphere were far different from what I expected. Wouldnt recommend this place if you are looking for an authentic or close to Omakase experience or Japanese food. For just a casual dinner out, would recommend. Nobu 57 in NYC delivers an exceptional dining experience from start to finish. The ambiance is sleek and sophisticated, perfect for a special night out. The food is simply outstandingevery dish is beautifully presented and packed with incredible flavors. The signature Black Cod with Miso and the Yellowtail Jalapeo are absolute musttries. The sushi is fresh and melts in your mouth. The service was attentive and knowledgeable, offering great recommendations throughout the meal. Though on the pricier side, the quality of the food and the overall experience make it worth every penny. Nobu 57 is a dining experience you wont forget! Highlight for me was the crispy rice with a caviar. You cant go wrong with these two. The rest of the dishes were pretty good but we were a bit puzzled by the squid pasta as the serving wasnt really substantial as an entree dish and it tasted like wokfried veggies. So wasnt really pleased by that. Decent soju too. You come to Nobu for the scene but not to have punchy Japanese dishes. Super happening restaurant!
It was super busy on a Saturday night, lots of people waiting, luckily we had booked a table.
Restaurant has a great vibe, great music as well.
We ordered a few dishes to share, all of them tastes great and very fresh!!
We got few cocktails, a nice bottle of warm sake, we had an amazing evening at Nobu 57!! Having dined at Nobu locations around the world, I was excited to try Nobu Fifty Seven for the first time. Even with a lastminute reservation, the experience was nothing short of fantastic. The staff were attentive and accommodating, making the evening smooth and enjoyable from the moment I walked in.

The food lived up to the high standards that Nobu is known forfresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Every dish met my expectations, reinforcing why Nobu remains a favorite wherever I travel.

Overall, my spontaneous dinner at Nobu Fifty Seven was a wonderful experience. Whether youre a longtime Nobu fan or new to the brand, this location delivers on all fronts with great service, superb food, and the signature Nobu atmosphere. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a refined yet relaxed dining option in New York City.","Monday: 11:45 AM – 10:15 PM

The servers are also the performers and they have talents!! I didnt know the songs theyre sining but i really enjoyed it.

The food has great taste. I would recommend the crispy wing. The sauce was really good.
You should be aware of that tips are already included the price. This place is just magical! It's like youve entered a dreamyBroadwaDisneyland. I was left speechless when I realized how talented those people are. We came here randomly for breakfast, just briefly run through the reviews to check if the food was decent, but we had no idea what to expect. At first, it felt strange that one of the servers had a microphone and was loudly sharing her story at 10 AM. But then they started singing, one after another, the lightshow went crazy, and confetti was flying around... It was literally like being in a dream. One moment your waitress is taking your order, and two seconds later, shes standing above you singing like a Disney princess! As a tourist, I cant imagine a more American place, and Im so thankful for this experience. You guys are fantastic and incredibly talented. Also, since this is a restaurant after all, I have to say that the food was amazing. Even though the staff is singing all the time, you wont wait longer for your food than you would at any regular place. Once again, you truly made my US trip special, and Im genuinely amazed and grateful for the show.

P.S. Its such a shame that I cannot post videos here, but you have to go and see it for yourself !!! If youre looking for high class food, this place isnt for you. Its standard American fare and its a diner. Still not a bad hamburger to be found in the house.  The waffle fries they serve are good.

However, its the singing that overshadows the ordinariness of the food.  I dont think theres any other place in NYC, outside of being at a Broadway play, that you will be captivated by some amazing talent.

Yes, youll be crammed into a seat with someone to your immediate left and right giving you little room to move. But once the staff breaks out in song you wont care.

Your food will come fast. Your server is very attentive. And they throw a 20 tip into the bill that goes to all staff

But make sure you give an extra tip that is collected in special buckets they will pass around.  This goes to help the amazing talent that sings. Server said You dont come here for the food. You come to be entertained! This is bang on accurate. The food is regular pub grub and was lacking flavour on all counts.

The entertainment was like no other place. Amazing singing and atmosphere. The place was buzzing. The servers are the singers and they sing to the whole restaurant while they serve. You are immerse in entertainment. Its pretty cool actually.

No reservations allowed and the wait was almost an hour long. Im not a fan of long waits so Id likely not go again but glad I went once. One other negative was the push for tips. They literally pass a bucket around while you are eating and then ask for a tip with the bill. What a great experience. Was a little apprehensive about the food seeing the reviews, but, we werent disappointed. Went for breakfast at 7am and were treated to songs virtually every 10 mins. The atmosphere was great despite the early start and staff were in good spirits. We had the Holy Moly french toast and breakfast burrito both were delicious.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:30 PM

Le Bernardin,"155 W 51st St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.6,40.7614218,-73.9817558,"My husband booked a special ""birthday"" lunch for our NYC trip. We arrived a little before our 12pm booking and the dining room had seated 2 tables a couple and a party of 3. Immediately you notice the cool air, high ceilings, low lighting and large medallion ""necklaces"" worn by the sommeliers. at least 3 spotted We chose the smaller tasting menu. The wine pairing recommendations were great. The bread basket presentation and choices were delightful. The raw and lightly cooked dishes were interesting and satisfying. The service staff balanced being there when you wanted something and being inconspicuous near walls and doorways when not in customer service mode. I ended up buying the Seafood Simple book after tasting the menu here.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience and for making my birthday special. We went to Le Bernardin about two months ago. The restaurant itself is very elegant and it is amazing for seafood lovers. We had the chefs tasting menu as well as the vegetarian tasting menu. All of the food was great but the langoustine and the chocolate tart was exceptional. At Le Bernardin they gave huge importance to all of the sauces. The sauces made the dish even more fabulous. We also got a special kitchen tour where we got to see how all the delicious food was being made. It was overall a great experience. You can only imagine how thrilled we were as seafood lovers to visit a 3 Michelinstarred restaurant specializing in seafood, and it exceeded all expectations. We chose the chef's tasting menu, and it was truly out of this world. Each dish was unique, yet all harmonized beautifully, leading to an unforgettable experience. The dessert was absolutely divine.

However, I did subtract one star in the ambience category as it felt quite packed and was a bit noisy, though I acknowledge this is very subjective. It's my favorite place in the city. I appreciate the ambiance and dim lighting, so it feels like you have some privacy. We got a tasting menu, and it was a lovely food adventure. Each course had its own flavor and texture. I appreciate that it is not easy not to overwhelm the taste of fish with sauses and condiments, and Le Bernadin does an excellent job with that. Deserts were excellent, too. It is nice that you can choose whether to have a tasting menu or a 4 course meal and choose your own dishes. Stuff is very attentive, but to be honest, sometimes it feels like there are so many of them that there is a lot of traffic in the dining room and it is a bit hectic. I would come back anytime though, love this place. Came here to celebrate a birthday, and the service was impeccable. Each and every team member was very friendly and helpful.

Special mention to our very friendly sommelier!

We decided to go before our booking to enjoy a drink at the bar. However, we were about to get a table within 30 minutes of our arrival.

Cocktails made perfectly 

The food tasted great, and everything was cooked perfectly. Perfect presentation.

Perfect for seafood lovers.

The highlight was the sauce in every dish. So well balanced  delicious!!

Osamil,"5 W 31st St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.6,40.746961,-73.9864309,"First time here and its was immaculate. My friend usually makes a reservation and she didnt this time. I got here at 530 pm and it was packed because we couldnt get a table. I got a tall table and it was starting to get busy as the night went by. We got happy hour drinks. We got the whole chicken, the rice cake with mussels and a salad octopus dish. It was soooooo yummy and they had a speakeasy. Its wonderful. Ill do it again. Next time reservation is necessary for sure. Came here with a friend accidentally because Baro by Chef's next door was closing up. We just walked in Friday 1130 PM, no reservations. It was still brimming with people.

The atmosphere was great! Service, amazing  the runners and the servers do their very best to put on a friendly accommodating attitude. Would come back just for their energy.

That being said, the food was very delicious. My friend and I already ate dinner and wanted drinks  snacks. We were already so full, but still managed to inhale everything we ordered because it was just that delicious. Please note, portions are small but dense in flavor.

We ordered
Seafood Ros Tokbokki 25
DaenjangFoie Gras Mousse  Toast 24
Grilled Scallops Skewer 9

All three were delicious, the sauce for the Tokbokkk was creamy, hint of spice and a whole ton of seafood umami. The liver mouse was savory, smooth, I ordered a second helping of bread jsut to slowly enjoy its beauty. Scallop, fresh, standard. I would come back to try the rest of the food menu.

We ordered Osamil and Limeito drinks. They are strong. I liked my drink, but wasn't blown away by its flavor. My friend's limeito was a lacking. The drinks as made with a kaffir lime leaf infused rum, the kaffir didn't come through. The sweet  sour balance was a off. I think it would be better as a drink with crushed ice vs cubed ice.

I would give a different drink another try for happy hour. But at full price, possibly not. Place is a 55 no questions. We were walkins on a Monday 7pm and it was busy! Got the last seats by the counter  which was great. Be mindful that the food is spicy! The fried sweet potatoes were a must for me to balance the flavor. Skewers were super flavorful pork belly for the win, the tartare was different dont go for it if youre expecting the french kind, but for us was worth trying. Absolutely delicious!! One of my top places in NYC so far for late night food. We went with a reservation and I think that's a good thing because the place was PACKED. It was pretty loud but we didn't have to raise our voices too much to have a conversation. Reasonable prices when you're sharing a lot of dishes with a group of friends 30 without alcohol. 1010 would come back!!! NOTHING MISSED. The pork shank is to die for so favourful and tender the cold slaw is Korean styled super refreshing to balance out the fattiness of the pork. The tartare was so marinated and didnt taste like nasty raw meat. The squid fries werent that special but was delicious overall amazing meal. It was also not super hard to get a table we sat at the high table the night I went. Great value for great food!","Monday: 5:00 – 11:00 PM

Thai Villa,"5 E 19th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.7,40.7390045,-73.9906704,"Thai Villa and had a mixed experience. The ambiance was truly remarkable, with beautiful decor and a warm, inviting atmosphere that made for a great dining environment.

The appetizers were the highlight of the meal. The Scallop Skewers were perfectly cooked, with tender scallops that were rich in flavor. The second appetizer, which resembled tacos though I cant recall the name, was a real treata crispy exterior with juicy, flavorful meat inside. It was a taste explosion and really got me excited for the rest of the meal.

However, the chef special entre didnt quite meet the same standard. It was too sweet for my palate, with the sweetness overwhelming the other flavors. It turned out to be a dessert for me.

Entrance faces southwest. Entrance is wheelchair accessible. Outdoor seating available.

Despite that, the appetizers and ambiance made the experience enjoyable, and Id recommend it for anyone who enjoys sweeter Thai dishes or is looking for a dining experience with great ambience great spot. I may return for classic menu. Wow, a great experience here. The food is authentic and excellent. We had a great time.There were four of us.We ordered four different menu items and shared our food.And I have to say, I will go back We were notified upon arrival that there was a 90minute limit on the tables but this wasn't an issue cause food came out quite fast. Everything we ordered was flavorful and fresh. One flaw that stood out to me was the completely unseasoned shrimps for the papaya salad. Service was quick, warm, and attentive. This is the best Thai food I've had in New York hands down. We didn't book ahead of time and sat outside, which wasn't too bad. We would have preferred to sit inside, but it was a 40minute wait. I'd strongly recommend booking ahead to get a table inside, and the vibes looked amazing. The food was amazing, so light and fragrant. The staff were so friendly and helpful and explained the menu which is large. We will be back for sure when we're next in the city  55 stars. I celebrated my friends birthday with a dinner here and Im so glad that we chose this restaurant. The service is amazing our server was so attentive and nice. We did not have to wait long for food and the ambience is so pretty inside I was in awe of the place. Very happy with the check because it was only 50 per person for a group of 4.

The River Café,"1 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.4,40.7038342,-73.9947936,"Found a last minute reservation for a table of four to celebrate a birthday and it did not disappoint. Everything was spectacular from the service to the food to the music. The history and charm of the establishment is delicately spoken throughout the interior and the staff are very professional. The menu is prefixed at 195 per person before taxes and tips. With drinks, it is about 250 per person. The food was meticulously well presented and tasted wonderful. The atmosphere is elegant and it is not loud at all to have a conversation. The dress code is consistently enforced, so be prepared.

Advice the waitstaff responsible for clearing the plates and the table can use help for larger tables of four. When there was only one waitstaff available to clear the table, he resorted to clearing the table in between two guests, on the right side and the left side of one and the other guest, instead of taking the time to clear away from the guest rather in front of the guest. This caused a steak knife to come centimeters away from grazing one of the guests eyes as he was clearing the plates. This review is for the bar only, as we were lucky enough not to dine here. I've passed by this place hundreds of times, and it always struck me as whimsical and romantic. A restaurant with this kind of waterfront view cant disappoint, right?

Recently, after dinner, we decided to finally stop in for drinks. We were dressed appropriately and had no issues being seated at the bar.

However, the smell inside was overwhelmingan oldfashioned, musty aroma that made me wonder if the ventilation system needs a serious upgrade.

As for the drinks, we ordered 'A View of Manhattan,' one of their signature cocktails, and a French Martini. Both were terrible, and at 22 each, they werent worth it. We couldnt finish them, paid, and left. I definitely wouldnt return for drinks.

One more thing I found out that The River Caf used to have a Michelin star, but lost it in 2023no surprise there. The River Cafe is a really special place. We had our rehearsal dinner here last year, and Allyson was by far the most communicative and lovely vendor we worked with. When we returned for our anniversary dinner this year, the staff recognized us and made us feel so welcomed by giving us some extra treats to enjoy throughout our meal. The food is phenomenal, and the ambiance is perfect for a romantic evening. Cant wait to return and make this an annual tradition! Super romantic restaurant! Good for dating or celebrating. Can see the Brooklyn bridge, especially pretty for night view. Every chair can see the view so it doesnt matter where you seat. Would highly recommend for dinner  First of all, I have to praise the chef and chefs
The meal was delicious! Let me add points to the restaurants taste

Next, I felt that there was something wrong with the restaurant service.
The white people at the front desk and taking seats are very racist! !

Leave the flowers at the front desk and keep them refrigerated! Put the flowers upside down!
The water from the bouquet was all over it... and my original bag was wet.
She doesn't even apologize for doing this!
It is strongly recommended that your store should indicate on the website what items cannot be brought! Such as a bouquet!

The racial discrimination of the white male attendant is very serious
I made a reservation very early for 1930 because it was my birthday and I wanted to reserve a seat by the window.
He said he would not give me a seat until 2130
Asked me if I wanted to wait until 2130 and I said where was the second row?
He said it would take three people to sit down
I said I saw that two people can sit in the second row.
He doesn't take it seriously
Keep asking me if you want to wait until 2130 or sit next to the wall first
After I sat down, I told the other waiter that I wanted to see the manager and I wanted to change seats!
After complaining, my friend and I were served a dish each!

I'm very grateful to the Asian waiter who took the white man's seat at the back.
He helped the restaurant improve its service quality!
I was willing to pay 20 tip, but the original bill was marked with 20!

The white male waiter is shown in Figure 8. You can ask him not to lower the quality of the restaurant!
After all, the food in the restaurant is delicious and the service quality of other employees is good!

I even saw two tables in front of the front window at 2030 that were empty.
There are also two people in the second row at one table!
It really makes people feel bad!
But because of the delicious food made by the chefs, I am not so angry and crazy.

I just went to the restaurant to celebrate my birthday. There is no need to have a bad meal at your restaurant!","Monday: Closed

Oiji Mi,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,40.7396687,-73.9924795,"Highly recommend experiencing this Korean fusion restaurant. It's entirely worth the Michelin star. Food is excellent, and stuff is very attentive, but just when you need them. The design of the restaurant is also very nice. Lighting and use of natural material creates this calming environment. One of my favorite features was that even though it is a tasting menu, you get to choose among 3 options for each course. We ordered different options to try more things, and all of them were excellent. Drinks are very good as well. The 5 course tasting menu was quite filling and we enjoyed every dish. Our favorites were the uni and sweet shrimp bowl and the sea bass. Service was excellent and attentive throughout the whole night. Beautiful and clean restaurant. We celebrated Chinese valentines day recently and they brought out a little dessert for us for that. We ordered cocktails but they also have a very extensive wine menu. 1 Michelin star 

Oiji Mi was such a fun experience! The seafood was super fresh, and the modern Korean dishes were on point. The vibes at the bar were amazing, the bartender was cute, and the assistant manager took great care of us  now I see why its impossible to snag a reservation!

The bossam and duck were to die for! Brilliant! Absolutely delicious tasting menu. Excellent service. Food is sublime! Definitely opt for the uni bowl and the seared Kobe appetizer. The cocktails are FANtastic
5 stars Awarded a Michelin onestar, this modern Korean restaurant in NYC is a mustvisit for foodies who love Asian fusion cuisine.

Celebrated a friends birthday here. We enjoyed the dining experience for its rich flavors, artistic dishes, beautiful ambiance, and stunning presentation.

Junior's Restaurant & Bakery,"1515 Broadway, W 45th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.4,40.7583331,-73.9866367,"Went in as a party of 4. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the overall settings of the restaurant. The service was top notch as well. The on the house salad, beets and pickles were pretty good, specially the beets tasted great. On the main courses we selected the Disco fries, their original burger and butterfly shrimp fries with tarter sauce. Their disco fries were awesome, the melted cheese n mushroom gravy wasnt too overpowering rather made the fries very delicious. Their shrimps were of really good sizes and they were fried with batter perfectly. The burger also looked really good and delicious. This location is right by the theaters and a little smaller and simpler than the 49th street location, which has a bigger and more Times Square vibe. However it is the same excellent, large serving size food the steak burger was large and delicious, friendly staff, and expensive but iconic cheesecake. Even when the line is out the door into the street, you will probably be seated in less than 20 minutes, and often you can grab seats at the bar. Food is always brought out fast. The vibe is diner and very casual. Overall any Juniors location is something we hit during every NYC visit and always find it reliable and consistent. Juniors serves up great food with large portions, making it a satisfying stop for anyone looking for a hearty meal. The menu prices are on the higher side, but the quality of the food makes it worth considering. Service is excellentfriendly and attentive staff who really enhance the experience.

However, the seating arrangements left much to be desired. We were squeezed into a tiny table, and they had to physically move it just to let people in and out, which was a bit uncomfortable.

Overall, its worth the trip just to check it off the list and say youve been there, but the seating situation might make you think twice about going back. I grew up in the Big Apple. The grand city with all of its charm and in spite of its history good and bad. It remains filled with wonderful memories for me. My family arrived in New York looking for a better life for us all. We were amazed at the variety and quality of the food. We were introduced to pizza and cheesecake! Both of which Juniors is famous for. I live in Florida and was surprised and happy to discover that I was able to order these delicious , delectable treats by mail. I received my order quickly and I was pleased with my order. It was very tasty and worth the price. I also got the Juniors coffee mug. I love it and use it to serve many things other than coffee and tea. Ive served lemon curd, chili, olives, relish, fruit, and salsa. Its my little bit of authentic New York! First time visit. The food was on point. This place was highly recommended to me by a coworker and I'm very happy that his recommendation was on point. My lunch was the Reuben sandwich. It was absolutely delicious and so full of flavor. The Key Lime cheesecake was phenomenal. I got lucky as it is seasonal and going out of season soon. This was a great first time experience and I will definitely come back again when I'm back in New York.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM

OLIO E PIÙ,"3 Greenwich Ave, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.6,40.7338208,-73.9997931,"Friday night, walked in as we thought there would be a long waiting, but we got sat at a bar and dined by the pizza furnace and enjoyed watching food coming out as well as the food.

Our server Gabriel is attentive and entertaining!

Loved the food and the vibe. Definitely coming back. The place has an amazing ambiance, you feel in a little village in Italy, lots of plants and good music. The service was good even though we got sat in a corner and the server didnt really pay much attention to us and we had to go find someone to ask for salt and pepper because the food was a little bland, not a lot of flavor in the pasta or the sauce. The pizza was good. Yea so anyways, I celebrated my 1yr anniversary here with my gf, and it was a wonderful experience. I wasnt really sure what to expect but it was really comfortable to eat there, we had outdoor seating, and the greatest waitress ever, Anelo. The atmosphere was both tranquil and lively when we entered and were promptly seated had a reservation but was early. Anelo brought us complimentary champagne shortly after we were seated to celebrate. I wasnt really sure what to order as Im not native to Italian cuisine so my gf and I went for the safe picks. I forgot to mention they give you bread, olives in olive oil, and water while you sit and wait to order. They ate with the presentation, and to whomever made the food I hope you know how happy we were to eat there that night. The ricotta was so creamy and delicious I will be going back just for it idgaf if its 15. My gf and I got the carbonara and honestly I had only seen them online at this point and never actually tasted it. The first bite was amazing but I realized something in it made my mouth a little tingly, allergies oh well, BUT I DEFINITELY KEPT EATING IT. I loved it so much I wanted to lick the plate and so did my gf. She was enjoying herself and the evening was so peaceful and happy. Then we got desert which they provided us on the house we are still very grateful. Overall 1110 experience, W restaurant, W Anelo, W Chef. Food is always good here. We came here so hungry and was serviced quickly, appetizers and bread w olives was served quickly which helped tide us over till we had our pasta. Our server Lucas was really quick and attentive, and friendly too! We had the carbonara and seafood pasta. Everything was cooked perfectly nothing overdone. Really hit the spot! A beautiful restaurant in West Village. Staffs were friendly and service was quick. The tartufo pizza and seafood pasta we got was ok with barely any seafood in the pasta but what really stood out was the espresso martini which is smooth and strong as well as tiramisu which taste delightfully unique vs tiramisu weve had at other Italian restaurant. Highly recommend for those looking for carbs in a beautiful setting. This restaurant offers indoor  outdoor seating and is dog friendly.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Au Cheval,"33 Cortlandt Alley, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,40.7181159,-74.0019617,"I recently visited Au Cheval in New York, and let me tell you, the burger was absolutely out of this world. The perfectly cooked patty, paired with the soft, buttery bun, was a match made in heaven. And don't even get me started on the baconcrispy, smoky, and just the right amount to take every bite to the next level. Every element of the burger was incredible, from the rich flavors to the juicy texture.

We were also celebrating a birthday, and the staff made the experience even more special. They surprised us with a complimentary glass of Prosecco and a scoop of ice cream for dessert. It was such a thoughtful touch that made the lunch unforgettable. The best burger Ive ever had. I would definitely recommend getting the bacon and egg on top. The General Janes appetizer was perfect.  We also had the Prime Rib Sandwich, Mac and cheese,  and chopped wedge salad. All was great. Completely lived up to the hype. I recently had the pleasure of dining at Au Cheval, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The ambiance of the restaurant is both sophisticated and welcoming, striking the perfect balance for a memorable evening out. The decor is stylish, with a warm, inviting atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.

The staff at Au Cheval are nothing short of amazing. Friendly and dynamic, they go above and beyond to ensure that every guest feels special and well taken care of. Their enthusiasm and knowledge about the menu really enhanced the overall dining experience.

Now, onto the food  the highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the burger. It's wellknown for a reason juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. While I'm personally not a fan of brioche buns, the quality of the burger itself more than made up for it. Each bite was a delight, and it's clear that a lot of thought and care goes into every ingredient and preparation method.

Overall, Au Cheval provided a fantastic dining experience that I can't wait to repeat. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy a great meal in a wonderful setting! Enjoyed a nice dinner at Au Cheval! Theyve done an excellent job of providing a cool atmosphere with fast, accommodating service. The Double Cheeseburger here has been on my list for over a year so it was great to finally try it. I added bacon and thought it was too thick and fatty for my liking. However, the burger itself was great, not super unique, but definitely a high quality burger. The fries and garlic aioli are delicious together. The Steak Frites was just as good, if not better than the burger. Cooked to tender perfection with naturally meaty flavor. We loved it! For a fine dining experience with quality food and a hip vibe, I recommend Au Cheval! I've tasted burgers across the globe, but nothing prepared me for this masterpiece. The patty was a symphony of flavors, the bun a soft, toasted embrace, and the toppings? Perfection. I'm tempted to say, ""I'm gonna need a gun to ask the chef for this recipe.""

Clinton St. Baking Company,"4 Clinton St, New York, NY 10002, USA",4.4,40.721264,-73.9838497,"Brunch at this spot in New York may require navigating a bit of a rough neighborhood, but hey, it's NYC  thats part of the charm! Once inside, you'll be greeted by an inviting modern decor and warm, attentive service that immediately makes you feel at ease.

Let's start with the cocktail an apple cider creation that was pure culinary artistry. It was the perfect balance of fall vibes but versatile enough to be enjoyed yearround. The apple flavor was bold, clearly locally sourced, and refreshingly crisp  not overly sweet, just perfection in a glass.

Now, for the real reason I'd catch a flight back to NYC the pancakes. These are not your average pancakes. Pancakemaking requires real skill, and this chef knows exactly how to get it right. These beauties were fluffy but never soggy, with crispy edges that didnt taste burnt, and a texture so light they almost melt in your mouth. Sweet but not sugary  its a delicate balance, and they nailed it. Honestly, these pancakes are in my top five of all time. Hats off to the kitchen for the love and mastery poured into every bite. Youll be rethinking your whole life with these pancakes! Absolutely phenomenal. Pretty good brunch spot  food was decent, albeit on the pricey side, and views great. If it's a nice day definitely grab a seat outside to get a nice view of the waters and bridge.

You pay when you place your order at the front and they give you a buzzer that will notify you when your food is ready for pick up. I made reservations for 3. Upon arrival, the waitress said that my table wasn't ready and to go outside and she'll call me when it's ready. The wait was about 10 to 15 minutes. Once we got in, we ordered a ton of food. We wanted to taste everything to see why this place was raved about. The food came quickly. It was the best breakfast that I've ever had. It tasted like grandma's cooking with more flavoring and no mistakes. The pancakes and french toast come with maple butter syrup. The grits were just right. The bacon tasted like honey or a light maple. The eggs were scrambled in real butter and tasted amazing. I forgot what  scrambled eggs were supposed to taste like. The last time it tasted like that was when I was a child. The latte was good and my friends said that the liquor was good. A tip is to get the southern breakfast and then pancakes or french toast on the side. That way Honestly, I dont get the hype about this place.
Its a nightmare to try and make a reservation and once we finally got it  well it did not live up to the expectations. The place was ok, ordered the fried chicken as a side  and it was good but not what I was expecting  the coating was peeling off the chicken and falling apart when cutting. The chai latte was decently made. The star of the meal was def the burger! It was well seasoned, fries reminded me of childhood nostalgia from the old school burger joints.
The deception, the pancakes should bring more blueberries not dried out and only a couple on the bottom stack. The maple butter syrup was delicious. The food is worth the hype! We came randomly on Tuesday morning when they opened and we did not have a wait at all which was amazing!. The food is delicious! Def get the pancakes with the maple syrup  Ill probably be dreaming about them for the next few weeks! Edited to add, WILLIAM our server was THE BEST! Like Id go back and request him again hes that personable, kind, and warm! I love when servers acknowledge my children when it comes time to place orders, its a nice touch. Thanks William!

Gramercy Tavern,"42 E 20th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.6,40.7384555,-73.9885064,"We had a fabulous meal, everything was delicious! We loved the dips so much we ordered a second round. The oysters were the best! And of course, the chocolate chip cookie for dessert! Highly recommend everything. Also, the service was great and Alicia took excellent care of us and we had fun with her! Definitely recommend! I came here for a birthday celebration. The food was good but not outstanding.  Their service was just ok. After serving each dish, they did not even bother to ask how s the taste of the dish. I guess they either were confident that customer would like the dishes or the restaurant did not care of their customers.  Their dessert was quite disappointing, they were too sweet.

I think I would not go back there again. I loved every experience we had at the Gramercy Tavern. We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and they really went out of their way to make it extra special.

The steak tartar and the duck mousse liver were incredible. So much flavour and excellent portion sizes. There cocktails were fantastic! Flavourful, unique and delicious.

The atmosphere has a great vibe. We were in the tavern and it was perfect.

We will definitely go back to the Tavern next time were in NYC. Came for their dining room menu. We got one of each things on the menu. Everything was delicious and so special. I loved the carrot, cabbage, and raviolis. They gave us a carrot cake since we're here for a small celebration and two lemon poppy seed pound cakes to go. Overall, this is one of my favorites restaurants in NYC! Would definitely come back here again! Went to this restaurant for restaurant week. Definitely great value at that price! The lumache was one of the best dishes I've had in NYC. Staff is also very friendly and cool decor. Also good free bread.

I do think the desserts however need improvement. They were too sweet and did not feel elevated compared to the other items.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:30 PM

NARO,"Rink Level CO, 610 5th Ave #04, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.7,40.7583251,-73.9780787,"Food was delicious and service was great. Our waiter checked on our table after serving every cocktail and dish to make sure we were enjoying them.

Ordered the famous kimchi fried rice and pork sandwich and they were worth the hype. Their salads arent really salads so dont expect something healthy.

Cocktails are unique and delicious. They wont replace the liquor though and will only serve as written in the menu.

Their dessert menu was almost as long as their actual food menu. The bingo was delicious and mangos were perfect.

Not sure if Ill return anytime soon though because their menu is very short, but Im sure Ill crave it again at some point! At NARO, every course is a taste of refined Korean cuisine, where ingredients shine with unexpected flavors. 

For the starter, I highly recommend the Snow Crab  it's delicate and sweet, complemented by the earthy sprouted grains and the rich, nutty pine nut milk that adds a smooth creaminess. It's a perfect balance of texture and flavor.

Summer Tomato 
bursts with natural sweetness and acidity, paired beautifully with fresh summer squash and the unique citrusy aroma of chopi leaf. The dish is a symphony of brightness and refreshing textures that capture the essence of summer.

Moving to the main course, the Pork Jowl is meltinyourmouth tender, with the bold and savory pinecone ssamjang giving it an umami punch. Paired with the refreshing cilantro salad and hearty barley rice, it's a satisfying bite every time. 

Red Snapperis a true standout  perfectly seared to achieve a crispy skin while the delicate flesh remains tender and juicy. The richness of lardo complements the mild flavor of the snapper, while the squid adds a touch of briny sweetness. The soybean brings a subtle, creamy earthiness that ties the whole dish together absolutely love it

End with the playful Oksusu dessert, where sweet corn ice cream meets a crispy wafer and luscious corn jam, with just the right hint of chocolate for a surprising yet comforting finish.  The layers of texture and flavor here are simply irresistible.

Watermelondessert  is a burst of light and refreshing sweetness. The playful combination of lemon verbena soda and cantaloupe provides a crisp, invigorating contrast, making this dessert the perfect palate cleanser. The interior echoes a bit, so it's not the best for conversations. However, the harmony between the ingredients was so fresh that it made eating enjoyable. It felt like every detail was carefully considered, and the dessert at the end, a corn ice cream that had a Korean style ingredient yet felt like a proper dessert, was quite memorable!! Food is pretty solid. Odor control is needed for the main dining area, since it is full of seafood odors because of the king crab dish which may not smell pleasantly. That said, the king crab dish tastes excellently as well as main protein dishes with barley rice. I think we did this backwards. Neither of us have eaten at Naro before and the first time we did it was for this special collaboration event.

Dont get me wrong. The experience and the meal was outstanding. The fact that it is a once in a lifetime meal that we can never have again is both special and sad.

Right from the getgo the staff was friendly warm, and welcoming. We were quickly ushered to our table, and presented with options for water and a drinks menu.

All the drinks were amazing. The Woosoo cooler was like a fizzy dance in the mouth, and the Naro Hawachae was like a refreshing spring breeze, very earthy and mellow. The Sonamu truly was unique, and the fact that it was only available for today and never again is  hard to describe.

The dishes themselves were something else. Each dish was a very high end take on very traditional Korean cuisine. They were all comforting, and at the same time extremely extravagant.

The Mulhwe set the stage. Very light and refreshing, some citrus, some acidity, and top tier fish. The scallop was my personal favorite. The scallop was so meaty and the mouse it was in was so complex and delightfully delicious.

From there each dish had its own shinning point. The use of zucchini and shrimp in the butter fish, the abalone stood out so beautifully in its dish. The taste of perilla in the cucumber. The duck spoke for itself, the barley crackers in the peach, and finally the entirety of the Doenjang. I commented out loud after I was done with the final dish, I miss it and am sad it is gone. I truly was.

At the end of the meal we were each presented with a box of two chocolate Canels.

The whole meal was wonder and this was a collaboration that I will remember for a long time to come. I will be back to try their main menu to see more of Naro. Fantastic meal, friendly staff, and beautiful ambiance. Hat more could you ask for?","Monday: 5:00 – 9:30 PM

Eleven Madison Park,"11 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.4,40.7416519,-73.9872353,"Eleven Madison Park impressed us with its elegant, modern design and impeccable service. As one of the best restaurants in the world, each dish was presented beautifully and tasted incredible. The attention to detail in both flavor and presentation was unmatched. Fun fact the restaurant holds three Michelin stars and recently switched to a plantbased menu. Another fact its known for its sustainable dining approach. The only downside? Its a splurge, but the experience, from the food to the atmosphere, made it absolutely unforgettable. Just about the best restaurant experience I have ever had. I have been to a couple Michelin starred restaurants, however Eleven Madison Park takes the cake! Its an all vegan Menu and every dish is an experience of its own. My personal favorite was actually the tomato tea with fresh local tomatos in a type of savory cookie. It was a way of consuming and experiencing the aroma of a tomato I had never had before and absolutely blew my mind. So simple yet so unique and absolutely incredible flavors. The service was perfect. They were very friendly, inviting and relaxed while retaining utmost professionalism with an astonishing attention to detail. All in all, a flawless dining experience, Id come back in a heartbeat. None of the photos I took do this place justice. It is an absolutely divine place to have an experience like no other! The food is elegant and carefully prepared to take your taste buds on an adventure of a lifetime. This is the first Michelin star restaurant we've ever been to, and it really set a standard for fine dining. We didn't know what to expect with a vegan restaurant, and we proudly say we'll come back again and again. Outrageously attentive service and everything feels so special. A real treat! Honestly, I've been to this restaurant once before, about 34 years ago, for my husband's company Christmas party. I remember enjoying the meat that was served back then. So, unaware that the restaurant had become vegetarian, I made a reservation and went again two years ago. I probably wouldn't have gone if I had known it was vegetarian. Anyway, it was still a pleasant experience. Normally, I hardly eat if there's no meat or fish protein, but I seriously considered trying vegetarianism after dining at this restaurant.

I still can't forget the clean and pure taste of the food and its heavenly aroma. The most delicious part was the appetizer bread and the butter, it was so amazingly tasty. However, I remember the portions not being a lot. We had beverage pairings, and even after finishing them all, I didn't feel full. I'm not sure if the portions were small, if I was missing meats, or if the food was just too delicious and I wanted to keep eating.

After the meal, we got granola from there, which was so delicious that I've been making my own granola since then and eating it every morning.

There's no doubt that it's a place influenced my life. We were absolutely stunned by the work done in this place, the service was on point, always here to keep everything clean on the table and prepare for next service, keeping the water and drinks always fresh.

The ambiance was very New York, jazz music, dimmed lights, cool vibe.

And the food was just a delight. We chose the 5 courses dinner and wine pairing, the wine was gorgeous, well chosen, always matched the taste of every course. We were very surprised by how much food we had, and felt like we ate for hours, which we did! Portions were perfect, the presentation was beautiful and not too over the top. The taste was on the salty side but never overpowering the taste of the different flavors in each dish.

An experience we would 100 recommend and do again in our lifetime!","Monday: 5:30 – 10:00 PM

ilili Restaurant,"236 5th Ave, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.5,40.7443856,-73.9877581,"This is one of the BEST Lebanese restaurants in NYC. The food is so delicious and authentic. Every bite is full of flavor and rich and satisfying! Customer service is excellent. The atmosphere is very elegant and nice. I wish I could give more than 5 starts! So good!

Aldo, they great selection of Lebanese wines that are really good. Delicious Lebanese food in the heart of New York. The restaurant is beautiful and elegant. The food is excellent.
The only issue, it took them some time to bring us the menu and waiters were coming and going and not paying attention that we didn't have the menus yet. Once we ordered, they served everything pretty fast. It is also very noisy in there. But in general it was a good experience. The food tastes really good and the portions are big! We ended up with a lot of leftovers to take home.
BTW, the White Coffee is not coffee!!! It's orange blossom tea! Food was great! We started with spicy margaritas. Meal was several mezzes, including an unbelievable hummus and beef sausages.  The duck shwarmawas good too, but the sauce a bit sweet.

Would have preferred seating in the main room but I guess parties of two are not seated there  We enjoyed the variety of Lebanese dishes. The branding was perfectly roasted and the brussels sprout  was delicious garnished with fresh grapes and walnuts.

The hostess Jana was super friendly. The bus boys were attentive. In comparison, our server was aloof ","Monday: 11:30 AM – 3:15 PM, 5:30 – 9:30 PM

Tom's,"2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025, USA",4.2,40.8055187,-73.9653887,"As a huge Seinfeld fan, visiting Toms Restaurant in NYC was an absolute thrill! Seeing the iconic exterior from the show in person was a surreal experience. The restaurant itself is charming, with that classic diner feel, and its really cool to be in the spot thats such a big part of television history. While its more about the nostalgia than the food, the overall experience was amazing for any Seinfeld fan. Definitely a mustsee if youre in New York and a fan of the show! Awe man, i can't tell you how excited I was to come here.  The very restaurant the Jerry Seinfeld was taped. Seinfeld is my favorite sitcom.  The food, service, and atmosphere were excellent!  I got the Ruben Pastrami sandwich and it was delicious. I'm from El Paso TX. As a result of being a fanatic of Seinfeld the show, by default I immensely adore this joint and made a second visit coming across several states away. While much of the stuff I can speak highly about, but today I was extremely disappointed with our sever. We really werent hungry and came out of town with our little one and decided to pay a visit just for being fans of this cozy joint a true American household brand. So, we ordered an omelette to share and a bowl of veggie soup for our little one. The food was very decent. But the shock came when the server quietly squeezed in there some 3.50 on top of a regular price without even letting us know before hand. He only told us after the fact that this 3.50 is a form of punishment for sharing the entree as he served us with an extra blank plate! Can you believe it?  I really didnt want to fight it as it was very unethical business gesture and we really didnt have much time. But I did let him know that this wasnt a cool move and itll certainly leave a bad taste. Im really unaware of anywhere in the world of a restaurant doing anything mean to their guests like that. Definitely uncool  This is definitely the place!

The food is good. The people are good.  The servers are nice and theyre friendly!

Michael's New York,"24 W 55th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,40.762163,-73.9763561,"Big fan of Michael's. Worked in the area for several years and had great business lunches a few times a year. Because I lived in a different part of the city, I never thought to try it for dinner. Recently, I was looking for a classic NYC fine dining restaurant in midtown good for families with kids for a family birthday celebration. A friend suggested we try Michael's and they delivered! The lovely hostess made it magical for our kids upon entry, we were treated with the table in the window, the food was fresh and tasty and the kids loved it!  There is not a kids menu but they will do kids pasta, simple burger, steak, chicken, etc. One of our kids  the pickiest eater   ordered a butter pasta and said it was the best they ever had. We all tried it and agreed, had to order another!
There is a pretty limited wine selection but all were very good.  Beer selection could be improved. The classic room has been the setting for many business deals and I have fond memories of a few, enhanced by our recent family experience. Love the laidback but firstclass vibe and unpretentious service. Highly recommend! The food was good and the staff was superb. The dining room is also beautiful. We went for a weekday lunch and it was very much a business crowd. The vibe is borderline stuffy, but the staff was so kind that their warmth offset that. Michael's is the perfect fine dining experience. I came here for my mother's 40th birthday and I really want to thank the staff for making it memorable. A complimentary birthday cake was given to us and the staff sang her happy birthday. The setting is luxurious and the wait staff have everything down to absolute perfection. The margarita pie was warm and cheesy and the fish was well seasoned and presented. I want to thank the manager Basdeo for making our night so special. Food is ok, not spectacular as I had expected from previous reviews. The tomato was very good, but the rest was not very tasty. Service was great, the  waiters was very attentive. The chair was badly worn and is in need of some tlc. It was not very busy when I was there. I had the perfect dinner here for Valentines Day! Great food, atmosphere and staff all around. Appetizers to dessert was all delicious. I am not even a fan of Kale but even their Kale Caesar Salad was so tasty I finished it.

The staff were lovely and when my server was about to leave the new server came  introduced herself. We dont get customer service like this in the UK.  thanks guys!
The food was delivered quickly and was quite tasty. The only negative was that the chicken breast was a little dry. The leg bit was delicious but the breast needs a bit of work. The rest of the meal was pleasant.
Staff are lovely  I would definitely return to this establishment.
I also had a delicious cocktail but I forgot to take a pic The beef rib and pastrami spare ribs are amazing. The Mac n Cheese is so creamy and worth a try too. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly and made the whole dining experience a wondering one. Tried the ribs platter and it could easily feed 3 people. Would definitely be back again the next time Im in New York. This restaurant is amazing! My boyfriend and I are on the quest to find the best BBQ in NYC. He grew up in the South and has fairly strong opinions when it comes to BBQ. Two of my colleagues recommended this place when I told them about our quest. We started with the Alabama white wings and buttermilk chicken bites. I was dying to try the white wings after reading all the positive reviews and they did not disappoint. I ordered the ribs and my boyfriend ordered the brisket. Blue Smoke makes the best ribs and brisket Ive tasted!! The ribs and brisket instantly fell apart. We ordered three sides to share the mac and cheese, coleslaw the best Ive had, and the cornbread. The cornbread was very good. We shared the chocolate chip cookies which were baked to perfection. The customer service was excellent and our waiter gave us great recommendations. We also really enjoyed the music. Our only critique was the interior design felt very modern. We did like the southern map though. Well be back for the delicious food and music! I like this place. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is very pleasant. My favorite on the menu is the Alabama wings. They have happy hour where you can enjoy delicious and refreshing drinks and cocktails. They have a varied menu, the restaurant is nice and the service is good. This place has been hit or miss for food quality and we still come back hoping for a hit but not any more. This last order was embarrassing and should not have been acceptable to management. Maybe takeout orders have poor quality control. The ribs barely had meat on the bones and the little that was there was dry and burnt. The chicken sandwich was missing most of the chicken. Its time to find another BBQ place.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Carbone New York,"181 Thompson St, New York, NY 10012, USA",4.3,40.7279891,-74.0002414,"The food is good, but there are better Italian places. The reputation exceeds the quality. However, if you do get a reservation go, it is good, just expensive. The vodka pasta is great. The meatballs are overrated. My favorite part is always the complimentary appetizers. I had a very pleasant experience for it being my first time!

The entire staff was exceptional hospitable. I was promptly seated by the kind hosts and our waiter Mark M was amazing! He assured us that our food was prepared accordingly to my fiancs food allergy, was extremely nice, patient and checked in on us frequently to make sure we were enjoying our meals. He provided an exceptional service that I dont see too often.

The food was delicious! The Caesar salad was fresh and one of the best I ever had. Although every plate was delicious, I was a little disappointed in how frugal they were with the ragu sauce for the tortellini. It was a little runny, and did not have a lot of meat.

Other than that, I think Carbone is definitely worth the experience, and Im very pleased! The impossible reservation! Until I just randomly got a table on a Wednesday. I heard so much about this place. The food. The history. The ambience. The front of house staff were wonderful, this feels like a 5 star restaurant. We sat and were greeted by our server, who seemed polite. Until we took a little too much time deciding what to eat. There was certainly a feel of being rushed, but despite this, our food arrived and it didnt disappoint! We had a selection of their pastas and then ordered any recommended deserts. Other than the service during the meal,
It was overall an enjoyable time. I wished there were 12 stars as Id probably give it 3.5. Dont forget the Italian candies at the exit Carbone is one of the best restaurants I ever been to. They really hit the mark in every way. From the quaint but vibrant atmosphere, impeccable service and absolutely delicious food.
Our server Antonio was on point. Great suggestions, speedy service with a friendly touch.
The burrata with caviar was my favourite dish with its complex and tantalizing flavours.
The Veal parmigiana was also incredible with a tasteful presentation.
The warm mozzarella not on the menu was also a special treat.
Id highly recommend the Caesar salad and the spicy rigatoni as well.
Carbone is a special experience with impeccable service and fantastic food.
I highly recommend it. Carbone is an exceptional culinary establishment. The dining experience begins with a delightful assortment of bread accompanied by mozzarella and salami, setting the stage for a memorable meal. The menu boasts a delectable array of dishes, including the tantalizing spicy vodka rigatoni, succulent meatballs, flavorful veal parmigiana, and a heavenly cheesecake. The service provided at Carbone is exemplary, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable dining experience.

Eataly NYC Downtown,"101 Liberty St, New York, NY 10007, USA",4.2,40.7103713,-74.0117875,"It is a great location to find hidden imported gems for Italian food lovers.  They have many options from open lunch style eaterys, prepared and cooked togo meals, fresh produce and meats, as well as packaged goods such as coffee and cheeses.  Prices aren't too bad, and the atmosphere is awesome.  Recommend taking a spin through the store if you are nearby and haven't seen one before. We went out for my best friends thirtieth birthday and we had a great time. The appetizers were so fresh and delicious. The lasagna I had was very layered and filled with flavor. All the beverages we had were excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure our experience was on point. I would highly suggest this place for a casual dinner or a nice event. A beautiful view of a very sad and memorable place for every American... A very beautiful game of words in the name of the institution. Pleasant atmosphere, good service and quite delicious food. But the burnt sides of pizza may be considered the top of culinary art in some country, but I don't like it very much... That's why I rated the institution a little lower. It's not scary, but it's not perfect in my opinion... Drinks are expensive, and in general the place is not an inexpensive restaurant. But we had a great time with friends and I can recommend this restaurant to visit. The design of the institution, by the way, is quite original, interesting and pleasant. Great place to eat.

Everything tastes really good. The portion sizes can be a bit small. The pizza is smaller than it looks and is very thin.

I went during the weekday at around 6. There was a small line but the wait wasn't very long.

I definitely recommend it, the food is fantastic. Stopped here before heading to the memorial tour.  Service was quick with menus and ice cold water.  We started with the calamari.  Probably top 5 I've ever had.  The outside was really crispy and the calamari was tender but the taste of the calamari, shrimp, and zucchini was excellent.  Our pastas was cooked perfectly and seasoned.  Nice stop for a quick lunch in the middle of the city.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM

The Capital Grille,"120 Broadway, New York, NY 10271, USA",4.6,40.707847,-74.010226,"My recent visit to Capital Grille was an unexpected delight. While renowned for its prime cuts, I discovered a haven for seafood lovers and cocktail enthusiasts alike.

The star of my meal was an exquisitely prepared tuna dish. Seared to perfection, it boasted a crisp exterior giving way to a succulent, meltinyourmouth center. The chef's expert touch was evident in the balanced flavors and thoughtful accompaniments, proving that Capital Grille's expertise extends well beyond beef.

However, the true highlight of the evening was the bar experience, courtesy of the talented Nicole. Her cocktails were nothing short of extraordinary  each sip a harmonious blend of flavors, showcasing both creativity and precision. From classic mixes to innovative concoctions, Nicole's drinks elevated the entire dining experience to new heights.

The ambiance struck a perfect balance between upscale and inviting, ideal for both special occasions and refined casual dining. Attentive service rounded out an impressive evening.

Capital Grille has successfully broadened its appeal, offering a diverse, highquality experience that caters to various palates. Whether you're craving a perfectly cooked steak, exploring seafood options, or seeking toptier cocktails, this restaurant delivers with finesse
Definitely check this place out Great service  delicious dishes. Im giving it a 9 out of 10 because the complementary bread was not fresh at all. Lobster  Crab Cakes are one of the best crab cakes I have ever had. Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails is a small portion but both tenderloin and lobster were unexpectedly perfect, tender and almost melts in my mouth. What a great experience Nice chain steakhouse that reopened earlier this year after 14 months due to fire damage. Steaks, appetizers were good. Nothing too impressive but servers were fast and food came out very quick which is always appreciated. Steak was cooked correctly at medium rare. This was my first time dining at a Capital Grille and rest assured, IT LIVED UP TO ALL THE HYPE! NYC always has the best food, but the dishes we had here at their Wall Street location were phenomenal. I ordered ribeye steak and mashed potatoes, and I promise you, that was the best steak Ive ever had in my life. The mashed potatoes may have been the best Ive ever had, as well. We were also delighted with yummy lollipop lamb chops and calamari for our apps. I dont even really like calamari, but, it was delish! For dessert, we had cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake. Not a huge fan of flourless chocolate cake, but that cheesecake was so divine, Im still thinking about it now. Lol. On top of some of the best food Ive ever had, the service was beyond five star. I am late to the party, but officially a huge fan of Capital Grille. Cant wait to go again! Consistency is what makes this place unique.  Thanks Chris for taking care of us. The porcini rubbed steak was softer than butter  ,  so was the lobster  mac n cheese . Definitely worthwhile.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 9:30 PM

Genesis House,"40A 10th Ave, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.5,40.741486,-74.008156,"Amazing authentic Korean cuisine. Genesis House is a mustvisit. We ordered 'Tasting Menu.' The highlights of our meal consisted of a balanced mix of both fish meat and animal meat. Each course was served in moderate proportions, leaving us satisfied at the end. The staff were attentive and friendly, providing assistance throughout the session. Highly recommend!

Now, I am curious about their other menus! enesis House is one of the most fascinating places Ive visiteddefinitely one of the best car showrooms out there. Ive been to all the car dealerships in New York and the surrounding areas, but this one tops them all.

The folks at Genesis have outdone themselves by turning a regular dealership into a free exhibit that feels like a modern art museum. The design and presentation are absolutely stunning and go far beyond what youd expect from a typical car showroom.

Theyve truly created something special here. Theres also a restaurant onsite that serves Korean cuisine, which I didnt get a chance to try, but Im definitely coming back for it.

If youre in New York, this place is a mustseewhether youre into cars or just appreciate great design and innovative spaces. I went with my friend for a workday dinner. We were super amazed by the elegant atmosphere with a library area and beautiful view of Little Island by the Hudson River great for sunset. For food, we got scallop pear salad, beef tartar, lamb chop our favorite!!, risotto also great and deonjang caramel pudding its super special and we loved it. Overall the experience is awesome. However for the high price, Id expect food with more layers of flavors. Would still highly recommend as a nice experience for creative Korean food It was a comfortable and peaceful spot for a weekday lunch. Most of the dishes we ordered were light yet flavorful. Although I hadn't tried much Korean cold noodle in the past, this one was definitely a good choicerefreshing and ideal for the upcoming summer. Rare nonfusiony Korean food outside Manhattan. Would recommend going during the day for just tea and desserts. Appetizers were ok, but mains were a little underwhelming. Space is very pretty and quiet, so still a good spot to take someone.","Monday: Closed

The Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare,"431 W 37th St, New York, NY 10018, USA",4.1,40.7561213,-73.9965897,"Ive been to this restaurant four times in the last two years, and each time is a special, surreal food experience. Each course is like a piece of edible artwork. Chefs Marco and Max have taken what was already an incredible dining establishment to new heights. My most recent visit on August 15th was my first time sitting at the counter and was unquestionably the best dining experience that Ive ever had. Already looking forward to my next culinary adventure there. Had high hopes and expectations and they were surpassed. One of the best meals youll have. The first few couple of tarts that start the meal are outstanding and the rest of the meal keeps pace. And watching the team work is unlike any other chefs table Ive sat at. Its amazing Would highly recommend this place for those who like seafoodforward tasting menus.  I was quite impressed by the balanced flavor combinations, beautiful presentation, friendly and welcoming service, and knowledge of the staff.  Every dish I had was phenomenal, including a Hokkaido Uni served on a warm piece of belgian waffle, an abalone dish with mushrooms, and a langoustine dish with a coconut and hibiscus foam.  The huckleberry dessert as well as the fujisan bread were also outstanding.

I found the staff to be professional and warm.  I was not drinking that evening and had some of the nonalcoholic drinks.  The cucumber lemongrass drink is highly recommended.  I was sitting at the counter so could also hear the sommelier's explanation of wines for those seated next to me.  Her knowledge and stories about the vintners, terroir, and nuances of the wine were impressive and fascinating to listen to.

As some may know, this is the second incarnation of Chef's Table. When it moved to its current location and changed chef's Michelin treated it as a new restaurant and ""took away"" its stars.  I'd say that Chef Max and Chef Marco are well on their way towards Michelin stars for the current iteration of the restaurant. Really cool spot in the back of the grocery store.

Great music most of the night sorta tailed off at the end of the night.

I would have given it 5 stars but for 560 with tax and tip I was still really hungry by the time I got home.

Everything was delicious except the crab dish which really didnt do it for ne and the presentation was on point.

I would love to go back but because of the price and most likely needing to eat a meal before I go I wouldnt go back. Food was delicious and the taste was unique. If you like seafood, then this place is definitely worth your try. Usually, Im worried if the fine dining food is too salty. Im glad the food here was not. My favorites are the starting courses. Definitely recommend here for a try. Cute place hidden in a supermarket.","Monday: Closed

My friends daughter knows we love Italian stuff  wanted us to see this place. We were lucky to have a little wine tasting w cheese that was offeredeverything looks so fresh  delicious I wanted to buy so many things!! The presentation was absolutely beautiful! You can purchase ingredients to prepare food at home or purchase what is made to take out or eat there at several diff spots within this complex. I must go back someday! I loved the overall vibe of the place. Pizza was good, desserts and coffee were delicious. Staff was very friendly. My husband and I went there a couple of times just to sit, relax and have some coffee after a day of walking through the city. Throughout our trip to New York we went here for breakfast, excellent sandwiches, fresh and tasty, the coffee is generally great. But the tastiest thing is the ice cream, beyond all praise. Thank you, I will recommend it to everyone. Great Italian food court, with several dining choices, like Pesce, Pasta, Pizza, Meat, Cafe, and wonderful Wine selections.  There you can buy food super tasty to carry on or just dine there. Also, I  suggest that you order a board of assorted cheeses and cold cuts accompanied by a good wine with your beloved one or your friends. And if you still want a fabulous desert,  ask for the Tiramis Ricetta della Nonna  and a great Espresso to top off a wonderful evening. Fun spot that is mostly grocery store than restaurant. Hidden in the very back youll find their pizza and pasta restaurant. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive. We arrived a little after 5pm and were told we needed to finish by 615pm since theyd need our table.

We thankfully finished on time, but you could see come dessert time they were getting ready to rush us a bit.

Juliette Restaurant,"135 N 5th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249, USA",4.3,40.7170111,-73.9590694,"Went for a girls afternoon out on a Sunday. Servers were friendly and food was on point. The dishes were all flavourful and the desserts just hit the spot. I really really liked the corn mashed side with the chicken. It wasnt too crowded on a Sunday evening and felt cosy. Would recommend. This was the perfect spot for a Sunday night dinner date. The restaurants interior was charming and cozy, perfect for a relaxed yet elegant evening. The standout dish for me was the zaatar salmon with beet coulisa beautifully balanced, bold, and creative dish that really impressed me. A big shoutout to the exceptional wait staff, especially Lauren, who made the night even more memorable with her attentive and personable service. It was a perfect evening from start to finish! Thanks Juliette! Love their happy hour menu  make sure you try their truffle fries ask for aioli instead of ketchup. Its incredible  also the most delicious rose wine, which is only 9 per glass during happy hours. The bursts from the regular menu is very fresh and delicious.
Mussels are my personal favorite, very soft, fresh and the sauce is delicious  I really enjoyed my time at Juliette! Our server was wonderful and very talkative and very attentive to our table. The food was wonderful. We did the fresh oysters as a table which were delicious and for an entree I had the Lamb burger. I highly recommend the lamb burger. It was definitely one of the best burgers Ive had in a while! Please get it cooked medium though. Atmosphere was lovely and very chic and french. We ate on the rooftop area. The ambience is very nice. I was not able to get pictures of everything I ordered. Every single plate we ordered was delicious. We also had cocktails with our lunch.

The atmosphere is great with the elegant interior. The food is great. The appetizer is good, but isnt surprised. The steak and the salmon is cooked perfectly but a bit lack of flavor. The dessert is really good. The toffee pudding is sweet but with some caulk an ice cream, it balances really well Went here specifically for the beef Wellington a birthday gift to my partner. It was, unfortunately, served very undercooked. The filet was almost raw in the middle and the inner pastry was doughy. It was very disappointing. However, I must say that the staff did an excellent job trying to make it up to us. They were outstanding. They gave us complimentary drinks, desserts and sides as there was not enough time to make another Wellington. All the other food we ate was delicious. I'd try this place again, if the Wellington had been in the oven for 10 more minutes I'm sure it would have been good. The atmosphere was very warm and calm and relaxing. I didnt make a reservation but the host very nicely helped sit me in. The food looked plain but tasted pretty good especially the potatoes. The restaurant week menu is cute. The only comment would be that most of their dishes go super hard on spices. I can't really distinguish the tomato with such a strong taste of rosemary in the chilled soup. But the crunchy cucumber bits were delicious. Wished there were more of those in the soup. Breads were delicious. The entrees are okay, up to the standards of a 60 restaurant week meal. I really enjoyed the greens by the salmon. Panna cotta was super tasty. The toffee pudding dish is too sweet for me or my friend. It doesn't help when it's paired with sweet icecream. The cream on the side was interesting  it tasted like oats. We put the cream and crispy pecan on bread as a delicious spread. Lovely atmosphere, but the food was a little off. The scotch egg was a bit raw not sure if that is how its supposed to be cooked, I still ate it but it was a bit flavourless as well. The beef Wellington was very rare, traditionally it is cooked medium rare and there was too much duxelle. The notable part of the experience was the service, our waiter was absolutely fantastic.

Jean-Georges,"1 Central Park W, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.5,40.7690576,-73.9815796,"I mean, would you expect less than 5 stars for a 2Michelin Star restaurant? The food was delicious, but beyond that, creative and thoughtful. I picked JeanGeorges for my Michelin Star dining experience because the menu sounded stellar. Too many restaurants either oversimplify or overcomplicate food. JeanGeorges walks the line of creativity and sophistication without crossing over into absurdity. I will definitely be back once my budget recovers! The full experience was great. 6 courses is a lot of food, but 10 is not impossible to accomplish.

1. Let the sommelier do her job. We went May 4th She is incredible. Her wine choices for us was absolutely perfect. The best sommelier I met. As a reference, I eat in great restaurants from Hawaii to Tokyo.
2. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy.

Perfect service. Perfect food. Great place. Can't say enough about how wonderful our experience was. They made our anniversary so special and were able to accommodate my gluten allergy with gluten free options and substitutions which made me feel looked after. The wagyu was one of the best I've ever had, and that's saying something. We visited numerous Michelin star restaurants in our New York City visit and all were great but JeanGeorges blew them all out of the water the food was spectacular service was personal and exceptional the sommelier was personable and accommodating the atmosphere was just beautiful the table lighting was beautiful and unique. My wife and I both agree on our last trip JeanGeorges was our favorite and exceeded all our exceptions. I would highly recommend and I want to thank the team for providing us a lasting memory and even allowing us a picture at the pass exceptional!!! This experience was incredible! I honestly cannot say anything negative about this fine dining experience. We chose the Six omnivore tasting. This was 268 per person. From the start, we had an incredible server. All encounters with JeanGeorges staff were positive. My favorite course was Course 3, the Peekytoe Crab. My least favorite which was still great was Course 4, the Black Sea Bass. I can only say I had a least favorite course because Im just not much of a fan of Sea Bass, but if you, you will enjoy it. Flavorful is such an understatement when describing the food we were served. Only great things to say about JeanGeorges! Thank you. NOTE Dress up! Even if you feel overdressed  youre not. Everyone in this restaurant was in either a suit or a proper dress.","Monday: Closed

We got the cauliflower with pork belly, eel,  cumin lamb, and steamed egg. The eel was our favorite! Would definitely come back to try more dishes, they have so much on their menu. The service and atmosphere were great! We ordered half of the Peking duck and the cumin lamb on a sizzling plate, and both dishes were absolutely delicious. We also tried their new green jasmine iced tea, which was fantastic. Everything was wonderful, and we'll definitely be returning! Everything we ordered was delicious. Only one item was quite light, HandPeeled Crab Meat, it was listed on the chef speciality. Probably the chef wasnt there on that day. 
I have a sweet tooth so I recommend Steamed Lotus Roots Stuffed Sticky Rice for dessert, you could find this item in Appetizers. BTW, the complimentary Chinese kimchi was very tasty.
Another thing I had to bring up was the service, its not professional, we got three different waiterswaitresses came to ask us if we are ready for the check yet. Jiang Nan was quite the experience! We ordered the whole Peking duck, and they give you a really nice thin wrap to eat it with. Order the green beans!!! They have a great pineapple beer that is served with a presentation over dry ice.

Craft,"43 E 19th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.5,40.7381658,-73.9886678,"Craft was a lovely experience throughout from the hostess saying hello to our server. The food was incredible, loved the different varieties of food and flavours. The restaurant is beautiful and provides lovely atmosphere throughout. We received compliments of the house soups to clean our palette, followed by great pairing of drinks, my friend and I shared a light and refreshing beet salad, and had our individual dishes of pasta, followed by a lovely dessert. Great place to connect with a good friend. Highly recommend. As a tourist, this restaurant was recommended by a local, and it did not disappoint!  Each staff member was extremely polite and attentive. The food was delicious and the portions were large my friend and I split a salad, entree, and side and still had left over. Would recommend to anyone visiting the city Overall a wonderful date night. Great staff, drinks and vibe. Some of the food was great  but much of it tasted just OK, and the duck I was served was a big let down. The waiter mentioned this was a family style restaurant  and that the gist of ""Craft"" is putting together your own smorgasbord of items to mix and match as you eat. I can see how this would be a much better dining experience food wise with a group. When you can only order a handful of items, stakes are high if something doesn't hit.

Here's a run down on our order, and as always, you might just love something that I was not into and vice versa.

Arugula Salad  unexpected winner here. the fresh greens, dressing and pine nuts all come together to make a surprisingly excellent salad. Almost skipped this, kudos to the wife on insisting.

Aligot  this is basically an incredibly cheesy mashed potato, possibly the best I've ever had. If you like cheese and potato's this is a must. It also made the duck much more palatable.

Hen of the woods  Lots of mentions of this in other reviews. The way they prepare it definitely lets the mushroom shine for itself. Tasted fresh, good flavor, but not mind blowing or anything.

Milk Braised Lamb Pappardelle  the lamb portions were great, extremely tender and flavorful. But the lamb and relatively plain pasta wasn't really enough to wow me. In this case, I might just be too much of a red sauce glutton to appreciate it.

Scallops  the scallops were very well done, perfect I'd say. They do provide more of the sauce on the side if you wanted to have some on every bite, but they were flavorful enough as initially presented.

Duck  This one was unfortunately the saddest part of the meal. It was a large portion, but the breast has no crispy skin on it at all. It also looked much different than some of other photos of duck others have posted. I unfortunately just wasn't into the way the duck breast was prepped this time around. The confit was the better half of the dish, but honestly, this was the dish I was most excited for, and yet it created the greatest regret. If you do order this, find a photo of it in the reviews that you like and ask if that's what it'll look like. Feel like I got catfished.

Chocolate Souffl  the ice creamgelato on the side was excellent and its a very good souffl. I was pretty full at this point and wish I had room to try the crme brulee cheesecake.

They also provided a final little treat, and an yet another treat on our way out. A nice ""just one more thing"" touch!

Again, the drinks were all very good. Our waiter was very informative and friendly. Can't say I was wowed food wise  although a couple of dishes were fantastic.

Overall, if I were to visit again, it would be with a larger group to try more things. Still, had a wonderful time. Excellent service and food was solid. The agnolotti and duck were our favorite dishes. Nice touches throughout the meal with the amuse bouche, sourdough bread, and complimentary dessert. The service was outstanding and the staff went above and beyond to welcome my mom to NYC. Theres a reason why Craft has been around for so long.. its an NYC staple and I cant wait to come back. Craft has an extensive and expensive selection of side dishes, including some very pricey mushrooms. The fingerling potatoes were nice and crispy. The papardelle with braised lamb was tasty. Everything was delicious but nothing that youre still thinking about the next day. Great menu for sharing to try a little of many things.","Monday: 5:00 – 9:00 PM

The atmosphere was fantastic as you had to go all the way up to almost the top floor to access to the restaurant which was beautiful. We arrived in time to see the sunset on the balcony which we opted to stay out there to have our pre dinner cocktails and small bite. It was breathtaking. The dining room had an incredible 360 view all around. Food was so unique and delicious and the service was stellar. Our sever was extremely attentive and at the end they all sang happy birthday and brought me a tiny birthday cake! All the small touches made the experience so memorable and special. Highly recommend this restaurant! The moment you exit the elevator and enter the restaurant, this place impresses at every turn. It strikes the perfect balance between sophistication and style without feeling too formal though some guests were very dress up, others were more casually dressed. Before the meal even started, we were welcomed with special cocktails and escorted to their unbelievable patio overlooking the city. It was clear that this experience was going to be unique, and it only got better from there. Each dish was a masterpieceflavorful, beautifully presented, and perfectly balancedthat tasted amazing with every bite. The 7course tasting menu is highly recommended. I can't praise this restaurant enough. One of the best restaurants Ive ever been to  wouldnt be surprised to see them with 3 Michelin stars in the very near future. Beautiful restaurant with exceptional cuisine to match. A perfect dining experience for a special occasion. We experienced the 4course menu, and every dish was a home run. The progression of dishesfrom caviar to dryaged black cod to the 2week dryaged duck breastwas phenomenal. The Moroccan tea was a lovely and memorable touch. Dessert was nextlevel, with five different items.

We especially appreciated the less stuffy, more approachable atmosphere. This allowed us to enjoy our evening in a more comfortable, relaxed manner. Yet the level of execution by the kitchen was just as elevated as restaurants with more formal settings.

Special thanks to AJ, Kevin, and Juan for taking such wonderful care of us. Service was seamless, gracious, and personal. Chef James truly built something wonderful in Saga. He would be so proud of how the team is continuing his legacy. From the buildings lobby, to the welcome drinkbar, and patio, this restaurant is truly topnotch. Its a perfect blend of elegance and chic, but not too over the top or fancy dress codes though of course some people will wear suits etc. Before food was even started, I told my partner that this was likely the best restaurant Ive ever been to, and it only got better. Every. Single. Dish was flavorful, unique, and perfectly balanced. Would absolutely recommend the 7course tasting menu. I truly cannot recommend this restaurant enough. I made a comment in the beginning joking about how it feels like theyre trying for three Michelin stars, and its a remarkable effort that very well might prove to be worthwhile in the upcoming years. Cant wait to return. I wanted to like it more. Not least because of the price tag. My fianc and I came here for my birthday. My main complaint is about the service anxious and uncoordinated, and my secondary complaint is about the food a few standout dishes but some were forgettable and the menu as a whole lacked cohesion. When we got out of the elevator, there were several nervous servers looking to whisk the different parties away for their welcome half cocktail and to take in the views. The views were amazing, and the cocktail was refreshing.

We were seated and there was a thoughtful note on our table wishing me happy birthday, and they even knew my age. Our primary server welcomed us but didnt explain the flow of the menu or experience to us. And when we told our sommelier that we would start with a cocktail and switch to wine, he promptly folded the menu shut and walked off, as if in a huff.

On the menu, the sushi treeforest was beautiful and each bite was delicious. The rest of the courses were good but not outstanding, until we got to the duck course, which was full of flavor and wellportioned. We also did get two glasses of wine, after all, to our somms delight. The special dessert for my birthday was a chocolate espresso cake and it was delicious. The standard desserts, however, lacked flavor and werent memorable. And in the style of Michelin or Michelinaspiring restaurants these days, they offered five small desserts instead of just focusing on one or two desserts and doing them well.

The service the whole night felt awkward and anxious. Servers are facilitators, and if the facilitator is nervous, the audience is going to feel it, too. Id recommend that Saga Hospitality provide some coaching to their servers on how to just have a little fun with the experience. We were waiting the whole time for the ice to break with our servers, but they were all so stiff that we felt not at ease ourselves.","Monday: 5:00 – 9:30 PM

Always a nice experience. The lovely Marissa took care of us and here recommendations were definitely on point. We started with the Arancini and it was really delicious , I loved the hint of truffle. Their burgers are always good which my cousin really enjoyed. I had the Shrimp Tagliatelle and it was really good as well. The desserts here are always good. Dont skip on them. I always get the Sticky Toffee Pudding which is always amazing, but decided on the Blueberry pie since Id like to try something new and it definitely didnt disappoint! It was really good!! The crust, filling and the vanilla ice cream on top was perfection. I really love this restaurant and highly recommend it whether youre visiting or not. Nice staff as well! We had a really nice experience at The Smith. We got there just as they opened and sat on their lovely patio.
We enjoyed a nice cappuccino along with the avocado toast. Our meal was accompanied by a refreshing salad.
There was a nice breeze as we watched the world go by.
The service was excellent and attentive. It looked like a really nice atmosphere inside as well. High ceilings and nicely designed.
If youre looking for a nice spot to enjoy a great meal The Smith is the place for you. THIS PLACE. Drinks were amazing. Food was amazing. Our server amazing. We got the burger which was maybe the best one weve had, this was debated at the table for quite some time. The calamari was fried perfectly and the salmon crispy rice was so so great. We all shared and it was the perfect amount. We were so excited to order the quarter pounders three big chocolate chip cookies but our server came back and told us they only had two left and they would give it to us but on the house! How sweet!!! They also have the cutest Photo Booth downstairs. I just landed from my flight from Jacksonville and I was really hungry. After checking into my hotel this restaurant popped up in my feed and it looked like some place I would really like.

On Sundays this location has a burger and a beer promotion and I'm happy I took advantage of it. The burger was excellent, the fries were nice and crisp, and the beer was quite refreshing.

This restaurant has a very large raw bar option as well. Although I'm not big on seafood or oysters the table across from me was and it seemed like they were thoroughly enjoying themselves.

This is a great place to visit if you're in town. I will happily revisit in the near future. Decided to stop here to grab a drink while we waited for the Rooftop bar to open. It was a beautiful New York day ! The temperature was cool and breezy. The restaurant had all the doors open for lots of fresh air and sunshine. My cocktail  was perfect ! It was a Wednesday and not too crowded. Next time I'm in the area I would try their food but their cocktails were made perfectly.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 11:00 PM

ONE Dine at One World Observatory,"117 West St, New York, NY 10007, USA",4.3,40.7130062,-74.013173,"One Dine at the One World Observatory is a restaurant that pleasantly surprised me with its pricing, especially when compared to other tower restaurants in Asia. Although its not cheap, at around 70 per person, its relatively reasonable for the experience you get. It's essential to make a reservation in advance, and note that you also need to purchase elevator tickets to access the restauranthaving just a reservation won't suffice.

The view from One Dine is absolutely stunning, particularly at night. I highly recommend going for dinner rather than lunch to fully appreciate the amazing atmosphere after dark. However, while the ambiance and view are topnotch, the food itself is quite midquality. It's a decent dining experience, but don't expect gourmet cuisine.

Overall, One Dine offers a memorable experience thanks to its breathtaking views and evening ambiance, making it worth a visit despite the average food quality. If you're planning to go, make sure to look at the pictures and reserve your spot well in advance. The view was amazing! Not sure if its worth almost 250 per person after taxes. When you go here the view is what you are paying for. The food was decent, change the location and it would not have been worth the price at all. The quality of the tables the space and the loudness it doesnt match the expectations that comes with the priceThe steak was not super hot and seemed like it had been sitting in the kitchen awhile before brining it out. I found a piece of paper in my dessert. The staff in restaurants was very nice, but when we went down to the observatory deck the staff was rude and unprofessional. If youre going to complain about your job and the guestswait until no one is around. It's a place where you're paying first for the excellent views of the NYC and secondly for food.
Restaurant accessible only if you have a ticket to One World Observatory so counting the price for tickets  make reservation with dining package.
If you're visiting just as part of One Deck Visit, be ready for a wait to be seated unless you're planning for a bar.
Cocktail prices are about 2325. This is a one of a kind dining experience! Highly recommend getting the lunch experience package. The food was delicious, the views were incredible, and our service was the best. Haque was an awesome waiter! I went here this past Sunday. Everything was amazing, the whole experience. The restaurant is on the 101st floor and I highly suggest you make your reservations around Sunset time if you want a beautiful picture. I got the charcuterie board a small plate and the steak and fries for the main and I got three vegan chocolate chip cookies and it came with ice cream which was amazing.

estiatorio Milos Midtown,"125 W 55th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,40.7635461,-73.9790278,"The dining room has not been updated in 25 years since it opened. The food is very good but not amazing. Picking out your own fish is silly and ends up feeling like a rip off on price. The salt baking takes an hour and can only be done with very expensive larger fish not worth it, grill is best preparation.  Tomato salad is their best item. Fries are 15 per serving!! The zucchini chips are 30 each!  Everything is a la cart. Desserts are disappointing. Service was not well coordinated and a bit odd personalities. This place is part of a chain with not great store level management. Still was packed on a rainy Sunday night. They have a 3 course pretheater menu for 65 pp.  Our bill for 5 people was 564 plus 100 tip my husband is a generous tipper. We felt it was overpriced but we still like it and would probably go back because we do like good Greek food. The atmosphere is very nice and open. The service was great. They took us to the booth to pick our own fish. And choose what we want them to be cooked as. The food was really good and we also choose a great chardonnay to go with the seafood. For the dessert, the creamy pastry is really great. I would bring my parents here next time Brunch at Milos in New York is an experience not to be missed! From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warm hospitality and impeccable service. The ambiance is elegant yet comfortable, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing brunch.

The brunch menu is a delightful blend of traditional and innovative dishes, all prepared with the freshest ingredients. The seafood selection is particularly impressive  we enjoyed the sashimi and the tuna, both of which were incredibly fresh and flavorful. The lamb chops were delicious. The Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts was a perfectly sweet ending to our meal.

The service was great

The quality and presentation of each dish were impeccable, reflecting the restaurant's dedication to culinary excellence.

Overall, our brunch at Milos was a truly wonderful experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a toptier brunch spot in New York! It is a restaurant specialized in fish, they bring it 3 times a week from Greece, you can also find incredible cuts of meat and lamb! We tried fish carpaccio, lamb and a rib eye with 21 days of aging, everything was incredible! The service, presentation, and atmosphere were incredible! It is an elegant and special place to share! 100 recommended! I would travel from Miami again just to eat here! Milos is a wellknown restaurant in the United States. However, compared to some other places I've visited, I found that their menu lacked variety. The appetizers were the highlight, but the main courses didn't have the same wow factor. The service is excellent, and the atmosphere is classy. One of the best things about this place is its fixed menu for pre and posttheater dining. The restaurant stays open until 12 a.m., making it a great option for a postBroadway show dinner.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 3:30 PM, 4:30 PM – 12:00 AM

Worth a visit I think, and will revisit to try their other menus as well but be prepared to wait.

We arrived several minutes later than our reservation time, yet had to wait 20min to get our seats, then another 10min for the server to finally notice us when seating another table next to us to bring water and menus. But once the food was ordered, everything was much faster.

There were a lot of frustrated diners crowding the lobby before and after our meal, who would often check in with the host on the status of their tables, so I dont this was a one off experience just for us. Also had a glimpse of their system and they pack the table schedules in so tight, with no buffer between seatings. Youre bound to wait here.

As for the food, we ordered 2 pastas, 2 appetizers, and 1 glass of wine for lunch, coming at a total of 100 before taxtip for two. Reasonable for the area and food quality. No complaints on the food whatsoever, it was good portioned and tasty. This has been on my list for so long and happy to say it did not disappoint! Tried out the buccatini and carbonara, and the burratta salad. Salad was yummy, the ingredients were so fresh. I wish we got more of it! The pastas were also great, perfectly portioned and we were able to finish both of our dishes. We topped it off with orange blossom panna cottage cheese and salted chocolate cake, both exquisite. Chocolate cake was not too sweet, although it was kind of heavy after such a carb filled meal haha. Panna cotta on the other hand was so light. Loved it. Got a last minute reservation for lunch on a weekday. Loved the summer watermelon beet salad. The shiso peppers were super tasty with a slight kick to it. Squid ink pasta with tomato sauce was fire! Low four. This place is overhyped and theres honestly a lot of better places in the village. However, the food is freshly prepared and they have a nice selection of pastas. Service is pretty timely. Outdoor seating was rough with the wind, as all the plants were getting knocked down. On the whole, I dont feel the desire to go back. Housemade Focaccia  great flavor from tomato salsa and pecorino, even better if it's warm

Pici Cacio e Pepe  it's the perfect texture for me, I'm normally not a big fan of cacio e pepe but this isn't as heavy as I fear

Tagliatelle  love the bolognese, meaty but light and a little zesty

Olive Oil Cake  the famous olive oil cake!! The syrup is entirely unnecessary for me but otherwise it's good, pairs even better with complementary birthday gelato ","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 5:00 – 11:00 PM

And the Mac  Cheese on the top was a  perfect match with the burger.

The Oreo Fries? I didn't try them because I don't like sweet things but one of my wife's friend is American and she said it was good so... I think It's worth to try this thing out.

I liked interior and vibe of the place as well.

Price range is reasonable for this quality of food.

Grace street is definitely a must visit if you want to have a quick treat. You dont really get service, you place an order, wait for your buzzer to ring and pick up what you got.

Most of the desserts are huge and pricey 1522, but the 7 Matcha Float is just as satisfying without breaking the bank. Then again, you could splurge on the Matcha Made in Heaven float like my friend and, well, float away to matcha heaven.

Mmmm, matcha heaven. Cute and insanely delicious desserts! Very authentic Japanese style icecream. Beautifully presented and the venue inside is super cute. My girls and I really enjoyed our time here and I've gotten so many compliments on our photos of how delicious everything looks! The treats are just as tasty as the pics look! After a heavy meal elsewhere on a warm evening, the Palm Peach snow sundae with pudding was the perfect ending. The positive statements in neon lights and quick friendly service were excellent.

BTW Entering the place feels uncomfortably stuffy the thermostat showed 77F... but as you eat the cold desserts, that stuffy humidity ends up feeling great, and you can finish the dessert without your teeth chattering. Smart thinking from the owner! We were on the hunt for some refreshing shaved ice bingsu and stumbled upon the delightful Sweets Laboratory by Hanamizuki  on Google Maps. While the bingsu certainly didn't disappoint, the true star of the show was their incredible croffle  a delectable hybrid of croissant and waffle. It was so good, we had to order a second one! The service was fast and friendly, adding to the overall positive experience. We highly recommend checking them out! Very cute place!  We had mango and tea snow ice just perfect individual size. Both tasted so yummy. Awesome service will be coming back with friends.","Monday: Closed

Max Brenner New York,"841 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.3,40.7343227,-73.991186,"Ive been coming to this restaurant for the past ten years, and it never disappoints. The waiter recommended the spicy rigatoni vodka, and it was outstandingbetter than what Ive had at some of the famous Italian restaurants in NYC. I also tried the pumpkin spice hot chocolate, which was the perfect drink especially if you prefer something thats not overly sweet.

Overall, the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere is consistently excellent, and I cant wait to return and explore more of the menu. Food was OK, but if you've been to Australia and had it there, this isn't the same menu  didn't think it was half as good as Oz.
Our waiter was good though.
They also have a non dessert menu if you don't want sweet things.

 Strawberry Crepe Came here for my sons graduation brunch. We were quickly seated as there were not many people in attendance at the restaurant. The server was amazing, he was very attentive, continued to check up on our table and ensure we had everything we needed. As an appetizer, we had spinach artichoke which was delicious. My oldest son ordered the brenner burger with an egg and he stated it was so good. The rest of the table has pasta Alfredo with salmon and shrimp, it was absolutely delicious. Me and my sons dad also had drinks. The boozy lemonade was a bit tart but still good and the mimosa was really good as well as the margaritas. Overall the experience was great. Thank you Max Brenner Restaurant is a chocolate lover's paradise! They have the best chocolate martinis and chocolate desserts I've ever had. The martinis are rich and indulgent, and each dessert is a decadent masterpiece. The food is also good, making it a perfect spot for a full dining experience. The service is topnotch, with friendly and attentive staff ensuring a delightful visit. Highly recommend for anyone looking to indulge in incredible chocolate treats and great food! Loved all the dishes that Ive tagged to this review. Max brenner has become my favorite now. Hazelnut waffle was out of the world. I loved the ambience as well.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 1:00 AM

The cake was creamier and lighter than the typical cheesecakes. I also had the black sesame coffee latte which was really balanced. I highly recommend. Small shop but plenty of outdoor seating. Staff is very friendly.

Love the asian inspired desserts. I got the taro port floss cream puff. It wasnt that sweet and there was plenty of salted egg yolk. Very unique mix of flavors and textures. I recently visited a delightful dessert spot and was thoroughly impressed by their unique offerings. The dessert in the photo, featuring a soft, fluffy texture covered in a light dusting of sweet powder, was a true treat. The combination of the rich, smooth filling and the subtle crunch on top created a perfect balance of flavors and textures. The presentation was also impeccable, making it a feast for the eyes as well as the palate. Its just PERFECT!!!!!
Im not super into dessert but this!!! Ugh love ittttttt cant get enough of
Not overly sweet. Not cheaply sweet. Just good! Chinese French patisserie!!
Highly recommend  This is one of my favorite dessert spots in NYC! They also have seasonal desserts so there are always some surprises. The taro and vitellus custard profiteroles are the best.","Monday: 1:00 – 9:00 PM

Sweet Moment,"106 Mott St Frnt P, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,40.71763,-73.997147,"The Mango Bingsoo was delicious. The dessert is definitely on the sweeter side but if youve got a sweet tooth this is the place to be. The shaved ice comes off really easily so its a little hard to not make a mess but just be gentle with your spoon. There are little cheesecake bites at the bottom of the dish that pair amazingly with the ice cream up top. They also serve it with a little side of condensed milk. Too sweet. But it's worth it. The atmosphere is clean and pleasant. They have delicious desserts. Today was my first time going and I tried an oreo flavored shaved ice cream. I couldn't finish it so I'm happy I received a large amount for an acceptable price  I will recommend it and go with friends for the next one. The staff is friendly  this is my FAV cafe ever i always end my chinatownsoho excursions here and this is my go to for when im craving something sweet or if i  want to take someone somewhere cute i love the interior, its super cozy and cute for taking photos. Ive come here COUNTLESS TIMESSS throughout the last couple years and theyre consistently good! workers r also friendly, just an overall nice environment. Also there is a bathroom D my favorites are their matcha cheesecake bingsu, their choco oreo bingsu, and their red velvet latte on the sweeter side!!!  their latte art is so so cute too Simple and trendy. Good for the young crowds. The place is tiny but with ample seating space. There are pictures of KPop boy bands along the pillars. Ordered a matcha and cheesecake shaved ice. It's so big. It's good for 34 people to share. The staff behind the counter work really fast. They're very efficient and they communicate with you about the order. Deff would go here again. All I am going to say is delicious , I recommend , I went today with my friends and we agreed this spot is good. I like the menu. I ended up getting a strawberry matcha and some macaroons. I will be going back to try out more.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Unique doesnt alway mean good but in this case it means amazing. The deserts always hit and give my taste buds a completely new experience that we always love. Highly recommend the tasting menu it always hits no matter what their current deserts are. Also the nicest people work here and they prepare everything right in front of you. Its is a little small and cozy inside but it doesnt even bother us. All around fantastic worth the trip every time! An extremely pleasant dessert omakase experience!
Ordered the new product tiramisu mochi and was immediately impressed! The texture was cloudlike, yielded to your teeth easily. The coffee flavor and the creamy flavor blended so well together. I would recommend order one for each because you will hate to share!
The oui quenelle set was thoughtfully designed. It started out with light, refreshing fruity flavors, then rich and buttery chocolate ones. You get diverse textures too  crispy, crumbly, crunchy, jiggly, fluffy
The presentation was beautiful. It truly pleased your eyes, nose and mouth at the same time. This morning, I had the distinct honor of being one of the first in the city to experience chikaliciousdessertbarnyc new revolutionary 7minute egg.

Yummmmmmelicious!

Chef Chicka combined her Japanese background with her French cooking expertise to create this perfect egg on a savory biscuit. Totally delicious  For an amazing dessert spot to satisfy your sweet tooth, this is the spot. These desserts are amazing and well thought out with tons of unique flavors and textures. I have been coming here for awhile and I am never disappointed in what I get. Make sure to get a personal tea pot to elevate the experience.

Staff were super friendly and bathroom was clean. Cozy spot so max 4 ppl for optimal experience. Reservations encouraged by not required. Wow, as a diabetic this was a real sweet but fun treat! Trying Omasake for the first time with desserts was definitely a tasty experience I enjoyed very much! All their options were amazing, and the tasting is new, so make sure you try it out yourself! I loved their homemade tea, too. It definitely was a fun solo time I'd definitely return. Make sure you check out the video of my experience on IG JadaExploresAll","Monday: 4:00 – 6:00 AM

The customer service was topnotchso friendly and welcoming. The coffee was absolutely delightful, with a rich flavor that hit the spot. The barista was especially kindhs name is Matt, Highly recommend for anyone looking for a cozy spot to enjoy some great coffee and warm hospitality! Patisserie Chanson located in Flat Iron District has a summer afternoon tea menu with bottomlessmimosas. Come get your fix of booze, savory bites, sweet desserts, hot tea, and scones! Graba table and their friendly staffs will start preparing your afternoon tea delights. Afternoon tea includes seven different savory bites, six different sweets, and hot brewed tea. Supplement with bottomless mimosa for that extra kick. Pop a bottle of Prosecco and mix it up with fresh seasonal juices for four different flavors to enjoy. Everythingtastes as good as it looks. Different flavors of each bite and each glass of mimosa is simply too good to be true. After Patisserie Chanson closes in the evening time, theres also a speakeasy inside called Thyme Bar for a historical Prohibition experience. Come try one of NYCs best afternoon teas around! stopped here while running errands in the Flatiron. big spacious modern space very clean and brightly lit with some seating. there are counters of many different pastries. ordered a Kouign Amann to go and was a good choiceflaky layers of rich cake with a decent amount of sweetness. definitely pairs well with coffee. overall, the service was pleasant and quick. definitely would stop by here again if in the areathe prices bend to the higher side though. Tried their dark chocolate olive oil cake. It was nice and moist! The crunch cake was also delicious! It reminded me of a ferrero rocher cake If you are going to this place for a Kouign Amann, dont fool yourself. I was a regular customer pre covid and would always get the plain one. It used to be my favorite dessert in NYC. Today I was extremely disappointed after ordering a KA there that didnt look or taste like one at all. It looked more like a croissant in a cup, if you can picture that. On top of it all, it was stale. I asked them and I was told they have a new chef, which explains the whole situation. I did not try anything else recently so this review is based on my last order. The server was very sweet despite the low quality of the pastry.","Monday: Closed

Eileen's Special Cheesecake,"17 Cleveland Pl, New York, NY 10012, USA",4.6,40.721568,-73.9972582,"Sooo good!! A must try New York style cheesecake, that hits the spot . The shop is quite small and for the most part it's just a grab and go situation, as it's a popular spot that gets crowded quickly line moves very fast.

Taste is a bit lighter than traditional NY cheesecake like junior's, not too sweet yet still richcreamy and flavourful no matter what you go with loved the caramel, and classic strawberry, which is why I enjoyed it so much along with my friends definitely a crowd pleaser!. Even my friend who usually doesn't like sweets wanted to go back for more  I've never seen her like that!

I also like that they have all the flavours in a mini round size which is perfect for trying different flavourssharing an assortment. There's also a little roadside public space right across the street with lots of benches if you need a spot to enjoy your cheesecake, weather permitting.

Overall highly recommend, and I will be returning the next time I visit the city. This is definitely the most addictive cheesecake Ive ever had. It probably has a lot to do with how it comes in small bitesized servings making you instantly reach out for another one. Maybe also because it comes in so many delicious flavors and youd have to get through a lot of combinations to find your favorite. Or maybe its really just rich and tasty and perfect in so many ways. This was my favorite pastry spot in New York. Small, cozy, and full of charm. The staff is incredibly friendly, and the cheesecakeswhether classic or with fruit toppingare amazing. Theyre not huge, but they dont need to be because the quality is outstanding. A fivestar recommendation and a mustvisit! Tried 4 flavors of their personal sized adorable cheesecakes  mango, coconut, pineapple, and strawberry.
Absolutely loved the mango, strawberry and pineapple cheesecakes, coconut was very mildly flavored as compared to the other three. The mango was the best !!!
The staff are super friendly, warm and welcoming. They have all the cheesecakes on the display. The service is pretty quick, and the line moves quickly, so it is not much of a wait. They accept both cards and cash payments.
This is a cute and cozy shop, with limited space to stand and eat, so we ate some and packed some more for later. Their packing was pretty good too.
100 would recommend coming here to try their cheesecakes. The portion size is perfect, and it's not too sweet and the flavours are yummy, but not overpowering.
Loooooved this place so much ! Delicious cheesecake. I got strawberry and Oreo. Oreo is usually my goto wherever I get cheesecake but I actually liked the strawberry more here which was delicious. The place was small, its a grabandgo joint. The line moved quick and we were in and out in no time. Id go back. It was good but I wouldnt make it a mustvisit type place.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

I got the BON. The combination of Nutella, vanilla ice cream and the waffle is fantastic. Best waffle Ive ever had in my life the WMD! Made fresh and just as delicious as the name. Staff is very friendly and service was very quick. Service was nice BUT they dropped the plastic top of the milk on my coffee and I only noticed when I was finishing it and I thought there was a huge bug in my cup. People were nice but for an 8.00 coffee it wasnt worth it. Plus oat milk and regular milk are not far in price so they shouldnt be charging more for it. Especially not 2. Also they advertise coffee on a ceramic cup but only offer take out cups. I wasnt gonna leave a review.. but the plastic cap inside my coffee scared the ish out of me. Tables surrounding place are taken by homeless, which is not the coffee shops fault but it made it hard to stay and enjoy.. had to take it on a walk. This place was cool, I tried their smores waffle, I loved it so much!!!!

Service was really bad, they did not respond properly for the questions I asked. I thoroughly enjoyed my cup in the hearty of NY. The service was great. The pricing was a bit pricey.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Have to consume in 30 minutes or they become liquid. Many flavors with real fruits. Ive been wanting to try this dessert spot and finally did, the drinks are not overly sweet and taste refreshing.  I had the strawberry banana yogurt drink and was surprised to taste the chunks of real banana.  Honestly this should be marketed as a breakfast meal, it was very filling but didnt make you feel like you were consuming something overly unhealthy.  Would recommend to try the drinks atleast once.

SugaBox,"55a Bayard St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.9,40.7152911,-73.9977305,"Cute little dessert spot with a good variety of different fruity and savory options. They have bubble teas and some mango and coconut based deserts. We ordered the Three Sisters and the fruity coconut pudding. Both were great but the Three Sisters was excellent. Amazing mix of different textures and sweet flavor. This Taiwanese dessert spot really outdoes itself with an impressive variety of treats. We tried the Taro Coco, which perfectly highlighted the earthy flavors of taro with a delightful mix of coconut in various formsnoodles, jelly, and milkcreating a tantalizing dance on the palate. The addition of sago made for a phenomenal combination.

We were also thoroughly impressed with the Mango Pomelo Sago drink. Not only was it a feast for the eyes with its bright yellow and orange hues, but the flavors were outstanding. The sweetness of the mango and the tangy punch of the pomelo complemented each other perfectly, offering a taste sensation we hadnt realized we were missing until now.

The ambiance of Sugabox adds to the experience with its cute, authentic decor, clean and inviting tables, and fast, friendly service that makes you feel right at home. A true gem in Chinatown and a mustvisit for dessert lovers! A true gem in Chinatown! We stopped in on a 90 June day and were greeted with a warm smile and friendly faces. Our party of five split the Taro Coco bowl and a traditional boba tea. The Taro Coco bowl had so much in and was so fun to eat! We all loved the noodles and boba as well as the fresh fruit and all this had to offer. I highly recommend and would make this a stop on my next trip to Manhattan! 10 out of 10! New dessert and drink spot in Chinatown.  Nice atmosphere,  ordered the Taro mochi milk tea and added water chestnut pop boba as extra topping, love it.  Their dessert looks very special, will definitely come back to try. 3.75 Three Sisters  a lot of fun textures but flavors were very mild. I especially wished the pandan and the osmanthus tea jelly was more strongly flavored, as everything taste wise was easily drowned out by the coconut milk.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 9:00 PM

Fun, colorful and festive decor. A tourist destination or trap , it's still a  great rest stop to recharge with sweet treats and American fare of comfort food after a long day of sightseeing and walking . And definitely kids friendly  but recommend reservation to have the best timing for seating  The atmosphere was to die for from the street! Its so charming and colorful and airy. And the food was amazing. Im not sure how people managed to eat dinner AND dessert, but someday I will! We only did dessert this time but every time food walked by it looked and smelled amazing!! If only you could get ice cream to go. This will have to be a place to visit every time were in town. This was our third visit, which did not disappoint!  Food is always yummy while the Frozen Hot Chocolate was SCRUMPTIOUS!!
Leo, the Manager was so pleasant and most accommodating to our requests. Looking forward to our next trip! Serendipity is a mecca known for chilled desserts like the celebrated Frozen Hot Chocolate. Located in the tony Upper East Side in a townhouse that is decorated with flair, it is hard to miss it on East 60th Street. Opened in 1954, this restaurant has had many customers including lots of celebrities. Their large menu is a delight and takes a while to read.

We were a party of five and three of us were celebrating birthdays. Es ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae which had a large slice of Chocolate Blackout cake, vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream adorned with a cherry. Annie and her daughter also had the same sundae. Allan always chooses the Strawberry Fields Sundae which looks like two could share but he had it to himself till the end when he could barely eat another bite. This colorful sundae had cheesecake, strawberry ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream and a cherry on top. I am fond of the Hot Fudge Sundae which I have had numerous times and know what it looks like. However what I got looked more like a composed dessert rather than the voluptuous sundae I was used to enjoying. My sundae had butter pecan and vanilla ice creams, hot fudge, whipped cream and a cherry. The fluted glass was slimmer and there was hardly any hot fudge dribbling down the sides of the glass nor had it gathered in a pool on the plate. I was bereft and asked for more sauce but it didnt quite do the trick. I ate as much as I could and Annie took the rest of the sauce home.

Service is fine here and everyone celebrating a birthday is given a lit candle on their dessert and the whole restaurant joins in to sing the birthday song. A unisex restroom which has lovely wallpaper is on the ground floor. The interior is a sight to behold. It is a very small place. The staircase is narrow so some may have difficulty walking up and down. I was sitting upstairs by the stairs and was run into a few times. The salad is a large size. The iconic frozen hot chocolate was good! I got the salted caramel one. It is good to try once but spending more than 20 for one is a bit much to me. Two salads and two frozen hot chocolates came out to 90 before tip.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Taiyaki NYC Japanese Ice Cream,"119 Baxter St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,40.7179112,-73.9988653,"Taiyaki NYC offers some of the most unique and delicious Japanese ice cream in the city! The soft serve in the fishshaped cone is both Instagramworthy and incredibly tasty. The flavors are rich, and the toppings are a fun, creative touch. However, at 9, its a bit on the pricey side for a dessert. While its a splurge, the experience is definitely worth it, especially if youre looking to treat yourself to something special. Just be prepared for the price tag. Overall, a delightful and memorable experience! The ice cream is decent, but not memorable. I had expected the cone to be larger considering that the average price for a serving is over 9. Overall, the concept is very cute and aesthetic, but the food is nothing special. Would order again if I passed by. Taiyaki NYC is an absolute gem! From the moment you step inside, you're greeted by the warm and inviting aroma of freshly made taiyaki. The soft, fishshaped waffles filled with creamy, rich ice cream are nothing short of perfection. The combination of the warm, slightly crispy taiyaki with the cold, flavorful ice cream is a match made in dessert heaven.

The variety of flavors and toppings is impressive, offering something for everyone, whether you prefer traditional Japanese flavors like matcha and red bean or more classic tastes like vanilla and chocolate. The presentation is also Instagramworthy, with every cone crafted to look as good as it tastes.

The staff is friendly and efficient, making the experience even more enjoyable. If you're looking for a unique and delicious treat, Taiyaki NYC is a mustvisit. Highly recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth! Well, it's an american ice cream in a fish cone, which is pricey...
Kids love the design of the cone, the little additions gummy ears, but it's just a basic ice cream.
Small bench to sit inside, so just enjoy the ice cream while walking around. This is what life is all about perfect softserve ice cream in full bloom, sitting in a cone that is shaped like a fish and ornamented with candies. I always go with matcha and hojicha, a beguiling blend of sugar and smoke, but I feel certain you cannot go wrong here. The staffers are always super nice, efficient, even heroic when its busy.

Mango Mango Dessert,"63 Bayard St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,40.7153412,-73.9980467,"After walking around Chinatown in the hot summer weather and having a spicy lunch, my husband and I needed something to cool down. Since he loves mango, we decided to stop by Mango Mango Dessert, attracted by their cute window display. The caf is SUPER tiny, which made me feel a bit claustrophobic, so we opted for takeout. I ordered the mango strawberry smoothie, and it was incredibly refreshingjust what we needed to cool off. The dessert options look amazing, so Im excited to try more next time! I have never been disappointed! The prices are affordable and the desserts are really delicious! I love any dessert that has a mango. I love their smoothies, tiramisu, cheesecake, etc. I haven't tried the hot menu yet drinks, purees, among others I'm waiting for winter to try them for the first time.
I would recommend you try anything! Really, nothing will disappoint you unless you are allergic to some ingredient. In Brooklyn they have a place with a little more space. This location was my first time going and as I saw that the space was very small I preferred to buy to go. I hope one day they can to have a establishment with more space. I really loved the Mango Pancake!! It was super fluffy and not too sweet! The mango and the whip cream were very light the mochi skin wrapped it all together in a delicious bundle.  The staff were also very nice and got us our order really quickly. The bag we got was very cute and high quality, definitely worth our optional 2.50 tip! I always go to Mango Mango when Im in Chinatown NY! Most of the time we stop each day to enjoy a refreshing mango dessert! My favorite is the Mango Juice with Watermelon and Rice Balls. I love the texture and chewiness of the rice balls. The only reason I took away a star is the seating. There isnt a time limit for customers so you can be waiting for a long time. Personally, I dont believe they need table service where they bring out water. I never drink it and it makes you feel more obligated to leave a tip. They also have a 10 minimum for credit card use. No public restroom. This place is a great dessert spot!  Mango Mango Dessert  serves a delicious  selection of sweet desserts and ice cream!  Definitely get the Snow  White  Mango Juice  Sago  Pomelo with Mango Ice Cream!  Service is quick  and the staff  is friendly and welcoming! They have limited indoor seating  so arrive early.  I wish I came here sooner!","Monday: 12:00 – 9:00 PM

Amorino Gelato - New York Times Square,"721 8th Ave, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.4,40.7595326,-73.9883524,"It was a work of art. We enjoyed our gelato there. I especially loved the Lime and Basilica flavor. Nothing would taste too sweet. I felt balanced by the sophisticated tastes. The Best Gelato ever!! The first time I tried this, Gelato was in Spain. I love all of the flavors they have. The way of serving the Gelato is unique. Great quality and service. You won't regret it.  150 recommended it  Jason was incredibly helpful throughout my visit. He kindly suggested various flavors and assisted me in selecting one that suited my dietary preferences. His friendly and courteous demeanor made the experience even more enjoyable. I ultimately chose the coconut flavor, which was absolutely delicious. Jason's artistic skills were evident in the beautiful presentation of my dessert. Delicious cool treat on a hot and humid NYC summer day.  A nice choice of flavors.  A little confusing flow to the ordering system.  Expensive for the portion they give.  The staff isn't the friendliest in the world. They weren't rude or anything, just not friendly or welcoming. I tried the ice cream at this shop, hoping to recapture the experience I had with Amorino in other countries. While the ice cream itself was decent, it wasn't quite as good as those experiences. Unfortunately, the service and ambiance fell short of expectations. Despite having a good number of staff, the service was disappointing. Staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful, barely answering questions. The place itself was extremely dirty, with overflowing trash cans and sticky floors. The bathroom was particularly unpleasant, the dirtiest I've encountered in NYC. Given the high prices, I expected a much better overall experience. While I might try their ice cream again elsewhere, I definitely won't be returning to this specific location.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 11:30 PM

Prince Tea House,"204 E 10th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.5,40.7294537,-73.9864067,"I hosted a bridal shower for my daughter at the East Village location in Sept. 2024.  Everything about this venue was wonderfulthe service, from planning to the event itself the atmosphere the food.  Everyone had a delightful time.  Planning the party long distance was easy thanks to Katy.  I had no doubt all would go smoothly and it did.  The tea service was delicious and the extras on the buffet were enjoyed by all.  I highly recommend this venue for any special event! First time trying Prince Tea House and absolutely loved it! Their tea are amazing! They have a great variety of teas even going to cocktails and cocktails! And their dessert is absolutely amazing! Definitely recommend this place to anyone, great for a date or just having some tea time. Service was great too, they came around and asked if we needed anything just the right amount of times. 1010 for everything. Try the coconut panna cotta and their mango crepe cake! Visited Prince Tea House for an afternoon treat and it was absolutely delightful! The Afternoon Tea for One set was a journey through exquisite flavors, starting with an array of finger sandwiches of each one tasty and wellprepared, from the truffle egg salad to the smoked salmon with scallion cream cheese. And the Granola Greek Yogurt, which was refreshing and filled with a great mix of textures.

The highlight for me was the Purple Yam Souffl, served with red bean ice cream. It was uniquely flavorful, perfectly fluffy, and not too sweet, definitely a musttry! I also enjoyed the Boba Affogato, a creative twist on the classic affogato.

The Tie Guan Yin Oolong Tea paired beautifully with the meal, enhancing the overall experience with its soothing aroma and taste. Highly recommend Prince Tea House for anyone looking for a sophisticated yet comforting tea experience. Cute and chill place to meet up and chat with friends. Even though we got the wrong order of fries the waiter was super nice and switched it. The wait time for food was quite long, around 20 minutes even though the shop wasn't that busy. At least the twister fries were super good, crunchy on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside

The salmon SLT was pretty good but they could've put more cream cheese and more filling because it was kinda dry. The salad on the side was nice but there wasn't enough dressing so some greens were dry. The salmon itself tastes fresh and had a good flavor and overall good presentation 

 The eggs benedict was alright,  the salmon became cooked since it was left out too long. But their poached eggs were sooo good, perfectly cooked with a runny yolk and very creamy which acts as the perfect sauce for the bread and greens. I had a lovely experience here with my friend. We came on a Sunday close to 1pm, and were able to secure a seat right away. We had the afternoon tea for two which cost 70 combined. I would say the price is worth it considering it's unlimited tea and a filling amount of food. I would recommend asking for caffeine free tea for anyone who is sensitive to too much caffeine. I would come again to try their other items.","Monday: 12:00 – 11:00 PM

Very allergen friendly including having a good number of gluten free options entire shop is vegan.

Bit pricey like many things in NYC but, has outdoor seating with great people watching so serves as a nice place to take a break and have a snack. Absolutely love this vegan dessert place! The variety of treats is impressive, and each one is a delightful explosion of flavors. From Strawberry Shortcake to Coffee Waffle Crunch, everything is so indulgent yet guiltfree. Plus, the presentation is stunning! A mustvisit for vegans, Jains, and dessert enthusiasts alike.

This vegan dessert spot is a true hidden gem!!! Was caught by surprise that this place was vegan. Casey the lady working the front was fantastic explained everything on the menu to me. She deserves a raise fantastic customer service. The ice cream was delicious and I couldnt even tell it was vegan. Would definitely recommend this place. Very affordable as well. Thank you for the vegan treat! We had the SMore ice cream and it was so incredibly tasty. The Graham crackers was crunchy, the ice cream silky, the fudge was just enough and the toasted marshmallow was a great touch. Worth the stop! The staff is really friendly and nice! I just thought this was really hyped up, I think its too expensive for the price but other than that it was fast and easy. The ice cream is as really good and its a big plus its vegan!

This location often doesn't have mango sticky rice available, but their other options are great. Looking forward to trying more! Visited today and these two desserts I ordered were really good and the pricing was fair. Me and my friend expected it to be pricey since it is in East village and manhattan but turns out it was the opposite. The store is almost always super busy but the service was great, even with the amount of people he was really patient. If you like mango, you really can't go wrong with this spot. The real surprise was the coconut pineapple panda cake  SO good. Good spot to unwind after a meal, for groups of all sizes. Very average desserts, not really much Else to expect from a chain store.

Decent option if you're nearby, and personally a coin toss if I had to choose Mango Mango or the Spot. They gave both of us the wrong order. She got mango juice and received coconut. I ordered A1 and received A3. Neither of us got sago in either order even though both should have sago in them.","Monday: 2:00 – 11:00 PM

Creperie NYC,"112 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012, USA",4.4,40.7296527,-74.0006936,"Been coming to this spot for over 10 years. Best desserts late night when craving sweets. Always order the Nutella, banana, strawberry, ice cream, whipped cream Terrible service. Came by today at 1 pm, on google the opening time is 1230. Me and my friend were told that we cannot order, I asked why and the employees covered the entrance with trash cans and proceeded to ignore us. I used to come here sometimes and the service was better, staffing needs an update. Quick and delicious. Unsure of where to get dessert we passed this place and we're not disappointed. Ordered s'mores and it was marshmallow googy and chocolaty I love crepes but this was the worst crepe I ever had! We had a crepe with Nutella and banana. The dough was dry, hard and too thin. The Nutella was way too much  not sure if they put so much to mask the badly done dough the crepe was then covered with powdered sugar  also not sure why that was on top if I didnt order powdered sugar.  On top of that it was quite pricey. Can absolutely not recommend. Save your money and go somewhere else. This is one of our favorite crepes place in the city. Whenever my best friend visit town, we go to this place for strawberry Nutella crepes with ice cream and the famous crepes, these are my favorite ones. They have other options which are decently good. We usually take out as this place is on street so sometimes its hard to eat there. This place is CASH ONLY, ensure you get cash before ordering. Service is below average as it is more like pay and get your order.

Response We specifically asked about are you guys only CASH, she was like yes always. I saw card paying machine and thats why asked, none mentioned it is cash only because of no network or whatever, they said it is cash only.","Monday: 12:30 PM – 3:00 AM

This location is okay.
There were people sitting outside the entrance steps which was annoying because it blocks 1 of 2 pathways to access the front door. But seating inside is limited.
It's a small space with a few tables inside.
The staff is very nice and helpful.
They did not have pistachio mille crepe at this location when I visited.  And it is what I wanted.
I ended up getting guava instead.  It was a bit slimy bc of the jam layers. When did lady m cake slices get so small? Is it just me or do they keep getting smaller and smaller? It's quite pricey for such a small slice of cake imo. But very delicious. The experience here was not as great as I expected. The cake slices were too sweet for me, and it was a bit overpriced but the signature Mille crepe was really tasty. Also, even though they are closing at 6 pm, the guy started to put all the chairs on the table around us. We had the feeling we had to hurry even though we had more than half an hour before closing. Dropped by for dessert and enjoyed the lavender mille crpes. The cake was soft with a delicious flavor. The cafe's interior is very simple and modern, and made for a nice place to take a break. A delightful experience. My favorite is their matcha green tea crepe. It is layered with smooth and creamy cream and not too overly sweet. Perfect soft and moist layered of crepes with consistent cream layering. The taste is heaven. I got to try their Rose Tea Latte as well and it was pretty good with smooth creamy rosy flavor. The service is great. One lady, I am not sure if she is the manager or server, lend me an Iphone charger. They have variety offerings and very diverse on their offerings. I also tried their original crepe with very creamy layer of cream. Great birthday cake, everyone was happy.

I liked it very much. Also, the tolerance and attention of the staff working at night was very good. He was very attentive and made many recommendations and his products were really high quality and fresh. Thank you for your attention and service. Hope to see you again I went to this place because of the high rating on Google reviews, but it wasn't as I expected. They have a variety of cake slices. The customer service and atmosphere were okay. We ordered Belgian Mousse Cake and Earl Grey Tea. The cake wasn't fresh to me, and the taste was average. There are some seats for dining in. While exploring the Times Square, I saw this bakery that offers macros, and I went for it. The bottom line is that the macros were below average for such a high price. Otherwise, the service, seating, and atmosphere were great. There was only one staff working does makes the wait long. 2 tables inside for dine in but has 2 tables outside for al fresco dining. Atmosphere for me is too bright. Bakery and dessert is good. Most coffees are not available at time of review so we have chocolate latte which is fair tasting. Accepts creditdebit. High chair not seen. Please see images for reference. A super duper bakery  fantastic location. Right next to Times Square and MM chocolate world. Was craving cakes  and this was a perfect place . A little expensive but ok once in a while .. service was good . There were a few tables inside to sit and eat . They also had ice creams ..

We ordered few stuffs  just loved the Nutella filled croissant  was reallyyyyyyyy good .. was about 89 but good for 23 of us to share . .. we also got ice creams and kids loved it .

Came across his place shout out to the black man that guided us to the spot. The atmosphere was outstanding the customer service was beyond excellent, and the gelato was great.

Lady M Cake Boutique - New York City,"36 W 40th St, New York, NY 10018, USA",4.1,40.7527864,-73.9836149,"I stumbled on this place after spending the afternoon relaxing at Bryant Park.  I spent 23 for two slices of cake.  More than I would have spent if I had seen the price inh.  But I'll have to say, they were both incredible.  I chose the checker and also the tiramisu.  The checker was okay, but the tiramasu was absolutely incredible.  Melted in my mouth.  The shop was very clean and had limited seating.  12 of the seats had reserved signs placed on their tables. The waitstaff was very polite and met my expectations.  I can't wait to bring my grandauggter some day soon! During our visit to New York, we stumbled upon the most delightful cheesecake spot I've ever encountered  hands down, the freshest and most delicious cheesecake I've ever tasted. It was simply PERFECT. Located in a prime spot near Bryant Park and the New York Public Library, this gem of a place offers not only mouthwatering cheesecake but also a charming atmosphere. The cheesecake was so rich and creamy, with a perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. Every bite was like a little piece of heaven. What made it even more special was that the cheesecakes were beautifully layered, resembling a true work of art. Each layer added a unique texture and flavor, making it a culinary masterpiece. The location couldn't be better, right in the heart of Manhattan, surrounded by the bustling energy of the city. It was the ideal spot to sit back, relax, and savor every mouthful of that heavenly cheesecake. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting New York City. Trust me, it's an experience you won't forget! good selection of layered cakes mille crepe. They have seasonal cakes. Salted caramel creamy and good but a bit too heavy. Strawberry is refreshing, sour and overall great. Lavender Matcha is good but nothing special. Price is on the higher end for NYC I did take out a slice of maroon and green tea crepe cake. So far, it was the most satisfying dessert in NYC to me Magnolia and Junior's were not my favourite. LOVED Marron as it is full of chestnut flavour. Green tea cake also had a very strong matcha flavour, so it was also great. Crepes taste a bit eggy though. As most of you know, ""it is not too sweet"" is the best compliment to a dessert in Asian culture. It was flavorful, fluffy, and not too sweet. Will visit before I leave NYC!

 edit I stopped by again today. The champagne cake had a hint of strawberry flavour, and the top gelatine jelly added great texture to it. The Pistachio cake had a great flavour natural pistachio flavour. I felt like both champagne and pistachio were a bit sweeter than other flavours. Tiramisu had a strong coffee flavour, and it was the sweetest among other flavours.

My favourites were Marron  Champagne  PitstahcioMatcha  Tiramisu If you've just finished your meal and are looking for something sweet to finish it off, you should definitely stop by Lady M! I like how the cakes here aren't too sweet, but it will do the job if you have a sweet tooth. I highly recommend sharing with a friend or two because I don't have a big sweet tooth myself. The staff was so friendly! The natural lighting is also great for all the food pics you may snap while you're here. The cakes are beautiful! They have a singular bathroom, but I appreciate how clean it was. Lady M is right by Bryant Park, so you could also order a slice of cake to go if you want to enjoy the outdoors. My recommendation is the early grey. Great place for dessert if you need a place to go!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

The food was OK nothing to write home about but it came fast  we were hungry. The prices are high for what you get. The fried cod was delicious, but the sides were a little bland  the ribs needed more sauce  were a little tough.

If we had kept walking just a few blocks, we would have seen many more restaurants  the prices get better as you get further away from Times Square. So you're definitely paying a premium for Junior's prime location.

Bathrooms are available  while the restaurant was packed there was no wait to eat on a busy Friday night because they had plenty of staff. We appreciate them being a welcoming place on our first night ever in New York City! We stopped by Juniors while walking through New York City and decided to try their famous cheesecake. The place looked quite full, but we got seated right away, and the staff was quick and attentive. We asked for recommendations and ended up with a raspberry cheesecake and a strawberry cheesecake. Both were absolutely amazing! The texture was creamy, cheesy, and full of flavor  easily some of the best cheesecake we've ever had.

Our waitress was very attentive, checking in on us and making sure our waters were refilled. We had no complaints at all, just an overall fantastic experience. Definitely worth five stars! We came here for dinein lunch on a Saturday and it was not too busy. We ordered the fish and chips, the corned beef sandwich, and the kids' menu linguine marinara. They were all kind of bland, nothing stood out as tasting very good. For dessert, we had the strawberry cheesecake and some of us liked it while others thought it tasted too artificial. That being said, the service was fast and friendly. Not planning to come back. First, I need to mention that our server Gregory was kind, patient and very knowledgeable with the menu. Food was great, very delicious and quality. We got the seasonal key lime cheesecake and it was light, definitely not overpowering with artificial flavors. I know its a tourist trap, but I still love their food.  It a New York, so dont expect an inexpensive meal, but its worth it.

I have to grab a slice of cheesecake every time I come here, but their sandwiches are surprisingly good too.  Service is hit or miss, but they are usually nice and friendly.  The restaurant is always clean.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Pure cheese no excess of flour, highly recommend it ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! please expand to richmond, va 

the dulce de leche coffee was perfect  the everything bagel seasoned po de queijo was too. if I lived nearby yall would see me daily, 1010, could not recommend more This was a very neat cafe that focused on Brazilian flavors. I will say I thought the food may have over shadowed the beverages but I also don't drink coffee so don't hang on my word there. I got a matcha latte I've had better but obviously I don't think that's what this place specializes in so I think it can be forgiven. I had the a croissant sandwich and my lady had these prosciutto sandwiches sorry I don't know the exact names they we're both outstanding albiet maybe on the pricey side but you're in the seaport district so it's to be expected. Such a cute bakery! Excellent Brazilian cheese bread and caramelized banana bread. The dulce de leche latte was also delicious. Highly recommend! Tiny little Cafe in this lovely area. Speciality is their little cheese breads which sold at 5 ball pieces for6. I can say they are quite delicious and came in traditional cheese, kalmata olive, and gluten free versions.

The Bacon and Egg toastie was also delicious.

The cafe is small.. seating a max of 15 people along a line of 5 small square tables but it seems to work fine with a large number of customers popping in for takeaway orders.

T-swirl Crepe,"2 Mott St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.6,40.713843,-73.998557,"Some of the products were almost out, so they were putting fewer ingredients. It wasn't worth it for the money we gave. It was flavorless. We watched how crepes were made in San Francisco for 3 minutes, so here it felt even longer when we had to wait. I ordered the shrimp avocado, and they put only 4 shrimps that were bland. And too much wasabi sauce, so I didn't taste anything else. My friend got the shrimp tempura that was way too spicy and was missing ingredients. And his drink was nothing special too. Maybe this place is way better if you get the sweet crepes, not the savory. The Litchee crepe was really good. Crispy with generous filling. The fruit was fresh. You can order at the kiosk or directly at the register. The place is small, only two tables, but waiting time wasn't too bad. I'd come back to try other crepes! Im a frequent tswirl customer at other locations. I ordered the spicy crabmeat, probably my 6th time getting it. The first thing I notice is it felt slimmer than usual.

Few bites into it I felt its lacking something. Without the crunchiness of Shallots, the texture is subpar. Edamame and Sesame seeds are nowhere to be found either. Seaweed salad? I MAY have tasted a strand or two. Not enough to tell that it was actually present and so as the sesame dressing.

If you are sold out on half the ingredients then at least let the customer know. It isnt fair asking customers to pay full price for half lacking crepe while charging extra for every  single additional ingredients.

Disappointing. I've never had a crepe before so I really wasn't expecting much. I thought they would be one of those things that look better than they taste... Boy was I wrong! These looked great but they tasted even better. I'm not sure what kind of magic unicorn tears they are stuffing in these things but it sure is good.
Unfortunately, we opted to share one, which quickly devolved into a fight to get the next bite once we realized how good these were. So get your own, or be prepared to battle for every bite. I am still carrying the scars from that mistake.
We had just eaten a fantastic lunch across the street and hopped in here for dessert. If we hadn't already eaten I would have tried one of their savory crepes, they look delicious.
I will definitely stop by here again if I ever get the chance and I will be darn sure to get my own, screw sharing! The crepes were very very good and extremely tasty. We ordered both sweet and savory crepes and both of them had sufficient filling, and tasted very good. The workers were nice and overall it was an enjoyable experience. The place is relatively small so be prepared to take out. Overall, 1010 recommend.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:00 PM

Ferrara Bakery & Cafe,"195 Grand St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.4,40.7190779,-73.9970913,"Cute place in Little Italy that we found via researching. It came highly recommended by locals for desserts. We stopped in and had coffee and dessert. The staff was super friendly and fun at the dine in section. Everything we had was amazing! Thanks to everyone who recommended it! Went to Ferrara late morning during the week when it was not too busy in the cafe.

Got a double espresso and a lobster tail,  which ran me 6.25 and 12.50 respectively.   I'm not sure if the cafe prices are higher than getting it to go,  but 12.50 for a lobster tail is beyond overpriced even for a tourist location.

This lobster tail was perfection all around.. perfect flaky shell and the cream filling was about the best I've ever had.   Made me feel a little better about that price.     Friendly service from my server Carmelo.

Overall would recommend... just expect to open the wallet I just had to try a New York cheesecake while visiting NYC, and it was fantastic  light and fluffy for a cheesecake. I highly recommend it.

However, the gelato I had there was the most expensive I've ever had, and it wasn't worth the price.

Lastly, the single aisle for takeaway was very narrow, making it hard for customers to browse and for others to pass through to pay.

There's a little sheltered outdoor bench to enjoy your delightful treats if you do not want a full sitdown service inside. If you're in New York City and have a sweet tooth or a love for Italian pastries, Ferrara Bakery  Cafe is a destination not to be missed.

Upon entering, you immediately feel like a kid again. You can order delectable desserts to go or experience a sitdown breakfast that includes all the senses.

It's a mustvisit for anyone wanting to immerse themselves in the flavors and traditions of Italian baking right in the heart of NYC. We liked the desserts we ordered, we just wished that the wait to be seated and served wasnt 1hr and 40mins, respectively. Unfortunately for us, we ordered a fruit plate and were served barely washed rotten fruits. Sometimes the service and quality of food spoils the whole experience. As such, we wouldnt be coming back or recommending this place ","Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Amorino Gelato - New York Greenwich Village,"60 University Pl, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.5,40.732917,-73.993894,"I visited this place because my friend wanted gelato. We were both drawn to the waffles, so we decided to get a Waffle with pistachio gelato and a chocolate macaron. The rich pistachio flavor paired with the whipped cream and waffle was amazingI couldn't get enough! We finished it all and left feeling satisfied! It has a wide variety of gelatos, a section of fruit gelatos and another milkbased section. Its flavor is exquisite and it does not contain too much sugar, which is pleasant to consume, it is so good. I highly recommend the "" dulce de leche "" , "" stracciatella "" and "" raspberry "" flavor ! . I stopped by for a quick snack and had a crepe with tiramisu and caramel drizzle, topped with dark chocolate sauce, as well as a cone of gelato with mango, strawberry, and vanilla flavors. The taste was amazing! The ambiance is great, with both indoor and outdoor seating areas. I was on a casual stroll with my friends and we wanted to stop by a cafe to get ourselves  a quick cup of coffee and found Amorinos on our way so we passed by.

I got myself a nice flat white and some macaroons, absolutely beautiful and tasty the both. The flat white had a very good balance between the coffee and milk which really elevated my day, unlike most other places where they always overdo one of them. As for the macaroons the overall texture and creaminess was very rich in flavor which really made it melt all the way in my mouth. I got a pistachio flavored one and my friend got hazelnut.

Would definitely recommend passing by this Gelateria, ill be coming back to give their gelato a try and give another google review Gelato and macaroons are a blend of creaminess and sweetness with an indescribable element of uniquely delicious flavor. It was also nice to see the gelato being made live
That being said the cones and waffle sticks were dry and flavorless to the point where it detracted the flavor of the gelato. The must try despite looking very decadent had the only redeeming qualities of the gelato and macaroon which were a very small portion of the dessert.
I would highly recommend SOLELY getting gelato in a cup as all other elements are subpar and overpriced.
My rating would most likely be much higher if I only tried the gelato","Monday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Magnolia Bakery,"401 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.3,40.7358891,-74.0049542,"Magnolia Bakery in the West Village is a mustvisit destination for anyone with a sweet tooth! I recently indulged in their famous treats, and let me tell you, it was absolutely delicious. The moment you step inside, you're greeted by the warm, inviting aroma of freshly baked goods that instantly puts you in a good mood.

The highlight of my visit was definitely their iconic banana pudding, which is creamy, decadent, and simply divine. Its no wonder this dessert has garnered a loyal following! I also tried their classic cupcakes, and each bite was a delightful explosion of flavor, perfectly moist and topped with rich, buttery frosting. The variety of treats available makes it hard to choose, but everything I sampled was fantastic.

Beyond the delicious offerings, Magnolia Bakery holds a special place in pop culture history, particularly for fans of HBO's ""Sex and the City."" This charming bakery gained fame as one of Carrie Bradshaw's favorite spots, often featured in scenes where she enjoyed a sweet treat while navigating the ups and downs of life and love in NYC. The iconic image of Carrie walking down the street with a cupcake in hand has become synonymous with the bakery, making it a pilgrimage site for fans of the show.

The atmosphere in the West Village location is cozy and nostalgic, with a charming decor that adds to the experience. Its the perfect spot to sit back, enjoy a treat, and soak in the vibrant energy of the neighborhood.

Overall, Magnolia Bakery is not just a place to satisfy your sweet cravings its a slice of New York City history that continues to capture the hearts of locals and visitors alike. Whether you're a ""Sex and the City"" enthusiast or simply someone who loves delicious baked goods, a visit to Magnolia Bakery is an absolute delight! Delicious banana pudding. The other desserts I got were good but the banana pudding what they are known for was outstanding. Freshly made as well. The servers were friendly and took care of us quickly. They were restocking the display of vans pudding once we got there. I would recommend this place. A small, laidback bakery in West Village with wonderful desserts and the worldfamous banana pudding.

We stopped by specifically to try their banana pudding, but they also offer a wide variety of other desserts. Each month, they feature a special version of the banana pudding with unique flavour twists. You simply grab the pudding from a small fridge inside and pay at the counter. They provide cutlery and napkins, but thats about itthere are no tables to sit and enjoy your desserts.

The banana pudding lived up to the hype. It wasnt overly sweet or too rich, and the portion size was just right, making it a perfect quick dessert after lunch or dinner if youre in the area. Visit July 2024

The cafe was nice and had a wide selection of desserts. I wish there was a place to sit and enjoy it though. A little bit pricey for the desserts, but it was good. Got the key lime pie ice box. There was a strong lime taste and the creme was silky smooth. The base did a nice job to balance out the flavours and texture This Bakery does not disappoint!
As a sex and the city fan it was a must go. We started our bakery tour or Magnolia from the original location and then found them over the city.
We had a selection of bake goodies but the chocolate fudge cake  and the world famous Banana pudding exceeded expectations!
We bought the kit home but got told they ship worldwide .hopefully they do if not a trip back to NYC for this bakery alone is worth it. ","Monday: 9:30 AM – 10:00 PM

Pinklady Cheese Tart,"11 Mott St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.6,40.7140628,-73.998918,"Delicious tarts!  Creamy and full of flavor.  We were having a gathering and got an assortment of 12 tarts buy 10 get 2 free. They were wonderful and everyone loved the tarts.  Not too sweet.  Friendly staff, not a large space, mostly takeout.
Street parking The store is accessible , but located in Chinatown, on Mott Street  which is a one laneone way street, heavily trafficked with cars, trucks and people.  Its difficult to find parking and to manage the crowded sidewalks. Walked in because I wanted something sweet. Didnt know any info about this little bakery.
OMG what an absolute wonderful surprise! We inhaled all of it in minutes. The flavors were rich and delicious without overkill. Adding it to my list so I can go back and bring my friends as well. Yummy little cheesecake tarts sold in a tiny little shop. Tiny tiny space.  Only two little tables.  Low lite.  They also sell bubble tea. I had Lemon and also strawberry milkshake. Everything is very cutesy. The ube and cheese tarts were nice as was the ube cold brew.  The space and seating is limited in size so take out is the way to go.

It was so yummy and perfectly tart balancing the sweetness from the crme and the crepes. Its a little pricier than I would like, but for the location and quality, the price is expected. We were impressed by the 2 desserts infused by Sake we had recently. The Dassai Blue Mille Crpes was light and not too sweet with delicate flavor. The matcha crape cake was soft and had intense matcha flavour. It was so delightful. Cant ever go wrong with lady M. we wanted the pistachio flavored one but that was only seasonal.

There was practically no ice even though I ordered it with ice. Menu was tiny and options were limited. They didnt even tapioca which was weird since theres some right next door. Definitely not authentic Small Taiwanese desert shop in a shared space with Tiger Sugar. Limited seating and it can get pretty crowded with lines for Tiger Sugar. You order at the kiosk. There are 8 bowls to choose from and you can add extra toppings. Theres also few drink options as well. IMO MetFresh is a lot better. The ingredients didnt seem very fresh. The taro balls were hard and not very chewy, like it has been sitting for a while. The grass jelly was also way too dense like hard jello. The tapioca jelly and taro was ok and the soup was refreshing. My order was made really fast and the sole worker that was manning the shop was very kind. I hope they can improve. I love Taiwanese desserts and theres not enough shops that offer them. What I got today was nothing that looks like the first reviewer's filled bowl with a reasonable amount of fillings. I got very sad little pieces of taro in my taro series bowl and few red and mung beans. I took the pictures while scooping what's in the bowl otherwise it'd be just brown water. However my two stars are for the taste itself. It was underwhelming and the taro pieces and red beans and mung beans were way too sweet. The ingredients also didn't taste fresh. Best green tea ice cream in New York City. Ingredients are of very high quality. The level of sweetness is just right. The texture is perfect. Look forward to trying the other flavors! Love the herbal jelly set! Very authentic that they pair the herbal jelly with cream! Their toppings also have a good texture.

Spot Dessert Bar,"11 W 32nd St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4.3,40.7476342,-73.9863441,"Ive been wanting to try this place for ages and its so good  such a great spot for desserts for all types of cravings. Whether its a thick french toast with ice cream, or a matcha fondant with ice cream, or a cheesecake disguised as a plant pot.

Excellent desserts all round! Shared three between four people. A great way to end a night after eating savoury foods.  Spot is located on the top floor of a really interesting Korean food court. We had the Big Orange, which was an orange chocolate mousse cake. It had an orange exterior with a nice glaze on it, a layer of mousse, some chocolate cake, and then a hard biscuit bottom. We really loved it! It wasn't really a groundbreaking flavor, but we would definitely get it again. It was really good and well crafted. Went with a few friends during the week and had a hard time finding this place. Located on the top floor inside a food mall, your senses are overwhelmed as you make your way up the flights of stairs. I almost didnt make it to the dessert bar because I wanted everything else before it.

There is a lot of hype for this dessert bar and maybe this location isnt the better of them but I dont see from where the hype comes. Ordered 5 different desserts waffle with ice cream, a potted plant, matcha green tea, and a yuzu dessert, and they were good and not cloyingly sweet but not memorable. Points are awarded for presentation and creativity, though.

Ill be back for a second time after I try all the other savory food options in this same space Desserts are definitely pricey for a cafeteria style location but the food was good. Delicious fresh and well presented. The cafeteria itself is too loud and dirty and crowded though. Should've went to St Mark's location instead. I do recommend the golden toast though. Cool place! Pretty creative desserts, nice presentation despite the fact that this place is actually one of the vendors in a food court. I tried matcha lava cake. Very rich taste and good texture. The entrance is not right on the street, so might be a bit difficult to find at first. It's located on the 2nd floor of the food gallery 32 2floors, not 1.5, so you'll need to take 2 flights of stairs.

The Dessert Bar,"20 W 23rd St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.6,40.7417143,-73.9905555,"Overall an amazing experience. Most of the desserts are very original and well thought, yet there were one or two that although very delicious felt like you can get them at the chanson bakery up the stairs.

The theatricality and presentation are right on point, adding both flavor and experience value.

Service is fantastic and very attentive yet at times a little too much.

I am already inlove with the Chanson Bakery and thier high tea and brunch but was definitely a whole new level.

It is a must experience for every New Yorker and tourist. What are wonderfully delicious spot here on the cusps of flatiron and Chelsea.
This little spot is adorable with plenty of seating out front and in the back.
Completely handicapped accessible. And easily accessed by train, bus or car.
Wonderful little sandwiches and snacks. Plus there's coffee and beverages.
Everything tastes good!
The staff is friendly and helpful. Definitely check this place out.
desert Update 62219 Actually did the entire dessert tasting complimented with a cocktail for each dish, it is a true must do. The host Jeff is amazing in his deliverance and demeanor. The desserts were all put together right in front of you enchanting the experience so much more. They are very intricate with appealing to your sense of smell along aide taste. Its not cheap, but to enlighten you taste buds, have an amazing ambience, be entertained by cool staff, this is a must for everyone. Do it, do it do it. Very elegant dessert bar. Theres a 6 course tasting option, some might like that. A must try if u can get a table! What an experience!!! Went to celebrate my friends 30th birthday and it was such a treat! The dessert tastings flowed so nicely together, presentation was perfect and everything tasted delicious! Nice atmosphere with incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff. Chef Rory MacDonald really knows what hes doing and I applaud him and the whole Dessert Bar team! Thank you for a wonderful experience well be back! More like 3.5 stars, but we are not allowed to give a half star...
I learned during my first visit to Patisserie Chanson that they have an eveningnight face that is even more exquisite and sexy, with tasting menu of nothing but high end, unique, creative desserts! The entrance is located right next to Patisserie Chanson, but the waiting area is actually the front part of the closed up Patisserie Chanson.

We got their 915pm reservation. We received a text from theme earlier in the day, asking us to make sure we arrive on time because they start right at 915pm. But, when we got there a few minutes before that, they were not ready to receive us. When they were finally ready, they came and took one or two couples at a time. Everyone was brought to their seat around 935pm. So, even thought the text said they start right on time, they really didn't...

Anyways, the inside is quite small, with about 10 or so bar seating, and three sofas that can seat total of six. The seat at the bar counter is where the action is, you get to chat with the chef, and also you get to see all the dessert creations right before your eyes.

When we sat down, we were giving a small ball of popcorn. It was Chili and Lime Sesame Popcorn, which is intended to make you crave some sweets. It was quite spicy!

Then, we got what I thought was some kind of plants in a pot. But no, they were some veggies and cheese, disguised as plants! Another little appetizer before the real dessert tasting course.

At the beginning, we were told a few rules. First, anything that is on the silver grate, they are not ready to be eaten yet. Don't eat until they tell you it is ready. Another thing is the use of flash photography.

Another thing we were told is that the main chef, Chef Rory Macdonald was in Paris, and that another chef will be leading a show. Since we were not notified of this, we were quite dissapointed...

Anyways, the show must go on... They will serve us SixCourse Dessert Tasting Menu for two full hours. There was an option to add Cocktail and Wine Paring to go with it. We decided to get the full experience, so we got the pairing as well.

We had to taste Gin  Tonic Sphere, which is a cocktail on a plate. EVOO Eucalyptus, an olive oil gelato. Honey Rice Pudding with local honey. Ferrero Rocher, a hazelnut mousse. Miso Pink Grapefruit, miso pudding tart with gelato. Spiced Bosc PearTonka with gelato. And then a little extra treat, alcoholic gummy bears.

We had a good time here, everyone was super nice and polite, friendly and took care of all customers really well. But, the music was way too loud, it made it difficult to hear the explanations of the desserts and drinks. Also, we were told to ask questions and have conversations with the chefs, but they were just busy making desserts and not very friendly...

The desserts were good and it is fun to watch them make them in front of us. But at the end, none of them really stood out. I wanted to be wowed by their creations, but they didn't quite live up to my expectations. They were mainly some kind of gelato, small portion and not very exciting flavors. So, good but not unforgettable.  The experience itself was really fun though, it sure is memorable. Their tasting menu do change seasonally, so you can get different kinds of desserts from here.",no operation time,"restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment"

Hello sir , this is nikhil mhatre from india ... can I get your email please ... want to discuss on the topic of business..

Thank yuh  Nice coffee shops CUTE I came to the store in search of Crigler's perfume, which is only available in New York and Monaco. The shop is located in a small space right on the first floor. We have Japanese staff, so you can choose the scent together with peace of mind. Although it is an expensive perfume, it is attractive because it can only be purchased at two stores in the world, and it feels like a mild perfume, probably because of the natural fragrance.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Canal Street Market,"265 Canal St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.4,40.7188807,-74.0008748,"This place is great. It's a food market on one side and little popup shops on the other. The food looked amazing, but we didn't try any. We did, however, buy a couple of items from the popup shops. We bought a necklace from one and earrings from another. It's a really nice spot to try multiple foods in one spot. Great for a solo visit, a date, or a group of friends. The chocolate place here run by Daniel was amazing . I had to support a young business owner and he was on Netflix school of chocolate . Check him out his chocolate is top line. the best chocolate I've ever tasted I thought this was a really cute, clean, fun, and convenient indoor market. Im glad that I found this spot. They have alot of seating in the back plus restrooms. The shopping is right next door to the food vendors. The shopping includes handmade contemporary jewelry, vintage clothes some handmade, candles, houseware etc For food they have a variety of Asian foods from handmade chocolate, dim sum, japanese sushi boxes, noodle soups, and much more. Its a great spot to chill after a long tour day and for all ages too. They also have an area for games and toys perfect for the little ones. I highly recommend this market. As a market gal this was a must on my NYC list. If youre from Melbourne Australia, the equivalent would be the Rose Street Market in Fitzroy.
This market is split in two. Stalls on one side and eateries on the other.
Featuring top retail and design concepts, along with upandcoming players, canalstreetmarket is a must for those who appreciate homemade  handmade wares.
Loved the jewellery in particular showing unique talent with both design and metal.
Add to this the variety of little restaurants next door and youve got yourself a formula that has people visiting from around the globe.
Had myself a little chicken green curry with roti from betongcaferestaurant and it certainly filled my tastebuds with delight.

Made an online order, every item I wanted was in stock, new quality and arrived within 2 days.. love it when things go this right. Very happy with my purchase and love going to the shop too just don't always have time!. Small shop with a lot of souvenirs. Some original and some are more common. Friendly staff. Wonderful NYCcentric gifts and souvenirs. Was helped by the delightful Liz shes a treasure!!

On my return visit I was just as pleased. This time the wonderful Maggie helped me. What a gem!! Give her a raise!! If you are visiting the city from outside the country, I do suggest going here because you can pick up some priceless keepsakes for a reasonable price.

Very cool jewelery! I really liked the earrings but they were a bit pricey, plus I wish i could afford the anthill castings My husband loved this store. I wasnt aware of what it was when he took me in. A bit of a museum with artifacts to buy. Wow! Amazing collection and very unique.

It was their Yankees drop during our visit and they had most items available then. Design and quality are good and I like that it feels somewhat exclusive for now as this is their only physical shop if im not mistaken although they do have an online store. There is no fitting room which is kinda weird when what youre selling is mostly clothing.

Staff we encountered during our visit was nice though and even gave us a complimentary sticker! My first time here and Ashley and Abby  Mark was so helpful and amazing!
They are a few subway  trains coming here so its easy to come !

My daughter purchased a sweatshirt from here because she has been following you guys for a long time and loves your brand, mission, and vision. I am grateful I was able to experience it myself.

Macy's,"151 W 34th St., New York, NY 10001, USA",4.4,40.750831,-73.9890961,"Macy's is perhaps the most recognizable department store in New York and one of its icons.
The 9story giant has a huge amount of products for sale from many brands. Unfortunately, on several occasions I myself found nothing there for myself.
For me, it's more as a tourist attraction than a store where I would shop.
An interesting feature is the wooden escalators, on the upper floors.
Excellent location right next to Times Square and the Empire State Building. Macy's is the quintessential New York City shopping experience!  Located in Herald Square, this flagship store is one of the largest department stores in the world, offering everything from fashion and beauty to home goods and accessories. The historic building itself is a sight to behold, with its beautiful architecture and classic charm.  Whether you're hunting for the latest trends, enjoying a bite at one of their eateries, or just marveling at the window displays, Macy's is a mustvisit. Don't miss their seasonal events and famous Thanksgiving Day Parade if you're in town! A true NYC icon that promises something for everyone.  Shop until you drop! Macy's largest store has massive eight floors right in the heart of Manhattan for those of you that love shopping!
Everything from fine jewelry to luxury goods to fashion and home and even kids toys courtesy of a Toys R Us, they have tons to shop from!
If anything, wear a good pair of shoes and be ready and patient. A lovely one stop shop for most of your needs and love for brands! Shopping is shopping with Macys is iconic Lighting was bright !

The escalators were built between 1920 and 1930 by the Otis Elevator Company, which pioneered the machinery. Theyre made of sturdy oak and ash, wood thats traditionally used in hardwood flooring. The mechanical parts have, for the most part, been updated, and modern safety measures have been put in place.

They might be updated and maintained regularly as per modern standards, but the nearly centuryold escalators arent going anywhere, despite how much they might creak. Much too big for me. You can easily spend hours in here, over 9 floors. Probably around three times the size of Selfridges in London. I imagine this would be a shoppers paradise. I did make some purchases but only visited the children and kitchen area and very briefly too. Also good selection of restaurants and cafes to relax in.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

What a fun amazing person to work with. He came to the rescue and put together everything I needed, highly recommend making an appointment with him for any and all shopping needs at this location.

Saks Fifth Avenue,"611 5th Ave, New York, NY 10022, USA",4.4,40.758138,-73.9772561,"Saks Fifth Avenue is an iconic luxury department store located in New York City, known for its upscale shopping experience. The flagship store is situated right on Fifth Avenue and offers a wide range of highend fashion brands, including designer clothing, shoes, handbags, and accessories for both men and women.

The store is also famous for its stunning window displays, especially during the holiday season, which draw in crowds from all over. Inside, youll find beautifully curated departments, including beauty products, jewelry, and home goods. Saks often hosts exclusive events and promotions, making it a great spot for fashion enthusiasts. Plus, the ambiance is elegant and sophisticated, making shopping there feel like a special occasion. If youre into luxury fashion, its definitely a mustvisit! I really enjoyed my experience here. My coworkers and I visited this location in hopes of finding a nice Colgan. Once we arrived at the upper floor, the sales pitches were flying. I must say I learned a lot  in a small window. I watched a scent I selected being made for me. It was a nice experience. Iconic store that is a must visit if in new york. It has all the designer brands, there is something for everyone. Staff were great, store was clean and very busy. My daughter was mesmerised by the fashion. Would love to go back. I recently ordered 16 expensive silk ties from Saks's online store.

To my surprise, each of the ties arrived folded in a small plastic envelope. The first thing to know about silk ties is that they should never be folded. The mere act of folding will warp the fabric, which can ruin a tie.

When I unfolded them, my concerns were confirmed each tie had huge creases running from side to side. To undo the creases, I  ironed them gently using the Silk setting of my iron. Although that undid the creases, there was nothing I could do about those areas being warped from folding.

You would think that a store as reputable as Saks would know how to treat silk ties, but as of this writing, their packing process folding them into small plastic envelopes damages the ties. It is standard when shipping silk ties to avoid folding, either by laying them flat in longer boxes, or by gently rolling them up.

I hope for the sake of future customers that Saks adopts a more appropriate way of packing ties. I will complain to management to try to get them to improve their process, which I imagine has ruined hundreds if not thousands of fine silk ties by now.

Until they do, I would advise others to not buy any silk ties online from Saks. This department store is located on Fifth Avenue, across from Rockefeller Center, and at Christmas it's worth standing on the opposite sidewalk to watch the spectacular Christmas show. The 10story facade of the Saks Fifth Avenue department store makes it a can'tmiss spot. A two minute show of LED lights, repeated every 7 to 8 minutes.

Even if you don't intend to shop, a walk inside is a mustdo experience. The windows of the department store are impressive, especially at night.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

It is a just a small slice of contemporary brands of what the flagship 5th Ave store offers. It was also nice to take a break from the overcrowded smaller stores in Soho. We enjoyed growing here and there's plenty of staff to help you.

Tip bathrooms are easily accessible on the bottom floor. Nice Bloomingdales in the heart of Soho. Friendly staff and conveniently located. Only draw back is the store is kind of small so the selection is limited. Pretty much like an upscale version of Macys. Very nice store with 3 floors and a variety of designer fashions from clothes and purses and shoes etc the store was also very nice and clean. The staff was also very nice. Bloomingdales?? BloomingHELL!!! You should be ashamed of yourselves!! We came here for a Bloomingdales lunch. Wanted a BLT, but you had no bacon. No bacon??? Staff even said they werent busy!!! Went for a Tuna melt instead but what is this you have produced? A soggy, squashed mess that is rammed into a plastic tray!!! Why no plates or proper cutlery. ??? Absolutely disgusting food and atrocious service. The street food vendors are hands down the place to eat!!! Victoria from Reece and Yasmine from Bloomingdales! A phenomenal experience one of the best I could ever make a review about. They have totally changed my whole outlook on shopping in general.

Bergdorf Goodman,"754 5th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,40.7634824,-73.9740152,"A place where you can shop a lot of luxury brand at the same time. When I visited I wanted to get a chanel bag. The gentleman helping us was helpful. Not very talkative and a bit sassy. But not disrespectful. So I dont really mind. I get to try some bags and finally decides on the classic. The one I tried was a bit less black so I asked if theres other options in the back and they gladly helped us find other same bags to choose. Overall it was an okay experience and we exit the place happily. Beware !!! Dont buy online from this store! Bought these Gucci slides for my husband for his birthday in May! He hasnt even had them for a year and this is the outcome in the picture below!! Ive bought plenty of pairs of these similar slides from the actual Gucci store, and they are still in good condition, after over three years of wear!  Not even sure if this company designer shoes are authentic!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!  NEVER engage in online retail with Bergdorf Goodman!!!

I ordered a pair of shoes and tried them on in my home. As they were too big for my feet, I initiated a return in a timely manner. Bergdorf Goodman sent the shoes back saying that they saw sand on the shoes?  I spoke with a representative over the phone, and they would not accept photos showing the perfect condition of the shoes.  They would only consider allowing me to return the shoes IN PERSON to the NYC store for inspection but I would now be outside the return policy and live several states away down south.

What is sad is that I had been a happy customer of the store when I lived in NYC.  A willingness to relook at the case, a more diligent customer service may have prevented this message.

Do NOT engage in online retail with this company!!!  BEWARE! Horrible customer service!
I got this CL sandals few months back and only wore it twice and the red bottoms started peeling . Mind you , I have all kind of designer shoes for years that are still in perfect condition and I am very careful with shoes . After calling the store they told me pretty much I am on  my own fixing them . So if you have 800 to waste definitely visit  Bergdorf Goodman Very beautiful! Stunning displays. I don't know why but yesterday felt like they were renovating or something was off.

Overall, their collections aren't inclusive, not too many new or young brands. Nothing I haven't  already  seen for 2 years now. The 2nd floor shoe section was very dull and lackluster. The third floor has more variety but basically the same designers line up they seem to always have. Chanel, Valentino, Fendi, Prada, Givenchy etc. I skipped the clothing section this time cause it was a bit dull the last 2 times I went.

Nothing I haven't seen in Hudson Yard or other luxury department stores. For some reason, employees were on their phones a lot, I'm assuming Omni customer service. Some barely looked up to interact with anyone. But I mean if you're being commissioned, why bother.

The Noir room was a mess. Literally one mannequin wasn't even dressed. The head pieces were going for Alexander McQueen I think...maybe black swan, I honestly don't know what was going on. Like, it was attempting avantgarde but lost focus halfway. Tacky is the best word.

Some of the clothing that was chosen looked so random and out of season. Like they forgot that it's spring going to summer. The denim jacket and shorts in one of the windows ate tho. Literally, the only interesting things I saw in there were on the customers walking around.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Large selection of brands, large shopping space spanning multiple levels, and spa services upstairs. Friendly staff and wellstocked store. We were lucky to visit this Nordstrom store before, sometime ago, this time was in Summer to enjoy the super fun Shoebar
Karen served us delightful nibbles and drinks
A fun place to meet friends or chat with fellow shoppers  bar customers
We enjoyed Prosecco and a crisp lager plus vegetarian dips Very deceptive sales tactic. Sign makes it look like items are 25 off but when you get to register its really just an offer to price match if item is on sale elsewhere. Why that involves 25 is not clear.  Turns out this rack is full price and ended up buying my daughter a dress I wouldnt have suggested if Id known.  Bummer Clean, spacious and inviting. Highly recommend Jennifer for all your needs from beauty, fragrance to clothing.  Incredibly kind, honest and has absolutely zero agenda other than to listen and help you find what youre looking for or may be worth trying.

She has an incredible eye and ability to be able to recognize what will work with you that you might not have thought otherwise.

Her insight and knowledge on her linedepartment and almost every area in store is immense.

She will also put you with appropriate person if she is unaware of a specific item outside of what shes confident in and doesnt play you along.

Truly hidden gem.

For me to write a review on how ecstatic and happy I am to have met her is saying a lot. Everyone in Nordstroms is friendly and there to help but Jennifer has a genuine authenticity that is above and beyond. The store is beautiful and wellorganized, featuring many great designers. However, its important to teach your associates to bid farewell to customers with the same genuine smile they greet them with even if they chose not to purchase anything after trying things on.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

I recommend it Its impossible to shop for fragrances they keep all the fragrances down to the cheap 8 body sprays locked up behind glass and dont give you time to test or smell them. Someone came and opened the fragrance vault for me and give me 5 seconds to chose something before closing it I truly needed 3 new sprays but walked out with none because I wasnt able to shop the items properly and pick which ones I liked. They need a dedicated fragrance team member to allow the customer time to choose and test what they want or else theyre just losing sales. I love the selection of the houseware and Christmas items. I was disappointed in the  checkout line on the second floor. But pleased with the 3 minute wait time on a Sunday evening on the first floor.. I was pleasantly surprised I received the worst treatment. On the first floor, a lady of Dominican origin. I will always say that customer service is very important.

So stop by to check out. Ive got nice sunglasses, bags, shoes, good designers for less on good days. This special compliment is for Rebecca  the 31st 6 Ave store , 2nd fl, womens coats.  Rebeca functioned beyond the call of duty to assist me with locating and selecting a raincoat.  She went into the storage unit and brought me several coats to consider.  Her amazing assistance was outstanding it enabled me to choose the one that was most appealing in style and fit.  Please reward her in the best manner for her patience, charm and A customer service.  I am truly grateful and happy for the rewarding shopping experience she provided.  Kudos to her! I would like to bring to your attention another store where they dont think about customers, they simply dont care about customers. Having 10 cash registers, they only serve two. How to understand this if not bad service. Why do they think standing in line for 35 minutes is acceptable? Isn't it enough to earn enough for all the cash registers to work? Great deals . Be prepared for the long checkout if you go in the afternoon. Went to about 4 of these stores in NY.
Its a bit like a jumble sale. You have to search a lot but there are a few amazing bargains to be had in these stores.
Amazing store for people that need larger fitting shoes

Even though it was out of season nor on the rack. She was just so kind and helpful! Conveniently located in heart of Flushing. Was there the other day doing return brought S, need M, all sold out online Anna from the return counter was helpful and friendly. She looked up the item and was able to locate a M on their system and have it ship to my house was told sometimes they are able to find it on their end even though its sold out online, sometimes not but its worth a try asking an associate to look up for you if its something you really like In the end Im happy since I was able to get it in my size. Thank you Anna  My experience was great Rudolf and Carla helped me to get best frame which Carla helped with and the best lens options which Rudolf recommended me and it helps me adapt to my vision. It was the adaptive lenses amazing Macy's is my goto for shopping! They have a wide selection of quality products, from clothing to home goods, and the store is wellorganized. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the frequent sales offer great value. Plus, their Backstage section has amazing deals. Highly recommend! About 10 days ago, I bought a shirt  and a pants for my son at Macy's basement. I take home to let my son tried it, then my son doesnt like it. Because I had to go to work, I didn't have time to return them right away, so it took me 10 days to return them because they have a 30day return period. The manager told me that the clothes We tried on couldn't be returned. He also said you can't return, if the tag was removed. Yes, I took one of the tag off, but I brought the full tags with the receipt, how did he not let me return it?saying that Macy's policy is this, and he ask me why did u not return them within 2 hours? What??? Did I hear you right? Is the return required within two hours? God, not 30 days to return it? It's only been 10 days, and he's still making all kinds of excuses because he's the manager? He's afraid I'm gonna return it and lose his performance bonus and the manager has a bad attitude and is very contemptuous, I will never shop here again, a very bad experience!!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Nordstrom Men's Store,"235 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,40.7666966,-73.9821026,"I went shopping for some beard grooming products. I received wonderful advice and service from Brian the specialist who suggested two great products and I now have a lovely soft beard.
Even though the sale was relatively small Brian still gave me lots of advice and help. I thoroughly recommend this store. The best selection with the best service. Beware of Clive upstairs. Hes gonna get you into something you didnt know you needed, but that you absolutely do. Not in a hardsell sort of way. More in that hes attuned to your needs. 1010 will return. Great men's department. Be aware that the offerings are from the best designers and luxurious fashion houses available.

The bar, tailor, and barbershop are a great addition to those who are shopping on the premises.

Much thanks to the gents in the suit department for their assistance during my visit. Saw the product is ""available for pickup today"" and that's the only reason I go for it.
Ordered, waited, until the day is almost over and still ""preparing for pickup"".
Checked with the pickup table, the black guy with a ""meh"" attitude be like ""the order is still not ready"" while the same product is right at the counter. So I checked with 1st floor again then comeback, this time a oversized white chick at the pickup table, told her to cancel the order. Then all of a sudden ""Boom!"" The order is ready.
Wowit must be magic huh.

If a product shows ""available for pickup today"", make sure its available today for customer to pickup in a reasonable time frame. Not before the store closes and the order is ""still preparing"" with a Kumon Learning Center face  while the exact same thing is right on the shelf. It's not the first time that happened in the same location.

I know I'm not white  it's alright but that's not the reason for the ""differentiated services"", work as sales in a department store is almost the bottom of the food chain, and the same thing is highly replaceable in a different store. For both reasons, there's no excuses for the dumdums to give me attitude.

We, are the people who put foods on their table, show some respect for the sugar daddy. 1. Awesome ambiance! A dj was playing on a Monday after work. The music was so good. Was very pleasantly surprised to see that it was a Brooklyn dj I recognized from some parties. Shoutout Rogue!
2. Jonathan B was a great sales associate. I spoke to him over the phone earlier that day and he was super helpful in helping me locate a suit I found online. He pulled the suit and got the tailor for alterations. I'm forgetting his name but he was wonderful as well.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

As we shift away from overconsumption, this is the place to build your capsule wardrobe. Aritzia has all the elevated basics you need. The store itself is nice, had a bigger selection than the soho one but thats where the pros end. I had about 5 different employees follow me around asking me if I needed help or to put my stuff in the dressing room. The same girl Eva? came to me 3 times. If I said no the first and second time, why continue to harass me? Its such an uncomfortable experience. Then the dressing room has no mirror so you have to come outside so the employees can harass you some more. And it all feels so fake and rehearsed. Leave me alone! Left without buying anything just bc I was so annoyed by that point. Back to the soho one it is. Not a bad selection, ok prices, helpful stuff. However, if you are not a petite female you are unlikely to find anything here Coming from Canada I was relatively expecting the same experience.
First and foremost I had to look for a Staff member as Nobody was even there to greet?
When I ask about the TNA line she relatively looked confused and said they were rebranding.
I just spoke with 4 Different aritzia location managers and they all told me they were rebranding the clothing but TNA, line will still be available.
Misinformation scream horrible buisness.
The entire store is a mess maybe they are going through renovations? Or i simply caught them short staffed.

I havent been here in over 4 years. The guy behind the counter was helpful and patient. I wish they would bring back the caramalized onion. I still remember it from 8 years ago when Riverdel was in Prospect Heights just down the street from where I lived on St Johns Place. It was the impetus for me to go vegan after almost 30 years as a vegetarian. Amazing public market full of grocery vendors and quick eats places. It has lots of options for food from pizza to burgers and other unique eats. It has lots of seating space and good ambiance. A nice new building to go shopping. It is actually a kind of market but then permanent and inside. You can find everything from vegetables to fish. There are also tables upstairs where you can eat quietly with a view of the stalls or the street, which is great. A great spot with so many different eateries. I opted for the Peruvian, Don ceviche. This place is a fantastic indoor market!  Essex Market has an endless selection of delicious  food stands  offering cheese , meat , pizza , sweets , fish , donuts , bagels , and so much more alongside stocked groceries stores!

Dover Street Market New York,"160 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10016, USA",4.3,40.7441358,-73.981773,"The stylist department store of choice, in the best city in the world, none other than the Dover street market New York! It's always worth checking in when you're in the area to see the ongoing remodeling projects throughout the store. Thank you to all the staff many that make every experience at dover street market a unforgettable experience. Upscale fashion retail store eith a very creative design. Order placed at 10am, was informed of cancellation at 230pm  email says refunded hasnt been processed, no one available via phone until after 6 at which point I was told fraud and order cancelled with no valid reason. Poor customer service availability and transparency Walking inside, those who aren't aware of what the store has to offer and are love affordably will welcomed by a unique store with interesting clothing installation and setup. However, when climbing further to each of the seven floors, the experience quickly becomes otherworldly to the casual shopper. In passing, you may question the connections staff possess to even be given a position of employment. In that same thought, you may even question how much they paid to work here. With each advancing floor, you may quickly reconsider even looking at the socks. Oh, and be honest with yourselfif you have to ask for the price, you can't afford it.

In all seriousness, Dover Street is a highend clothing store offering only the most premium products of premium brands. The first two floors may only be within the everyday shopper's budget, but every guest with even the slightest interest should browse everything. As others have mentioned, security and staff workers who are all tasked with being attentive to their surroundings are present. But with a business selling brands like Gucci that have tshirts at 5,000, this shouldn't remotely be surprising. During my recent experience here, my group of four all carried in backpacks. Employees were more attentive to us, yet with how easy shoplifting could be, it only made sense, and this did not in any regards make us feel unwanted or targeted for any explicit reason. This store is sick, expensive, and epic. We always come here every time we visit, literally every time. We usually just come to look at the new exhibits, wear fun outfits, and occasionally buy some small things. While the clothes here are typically crazy expensive, its cool to see this caliber of fashion this close. The bakery is also pretty cool, very healthy focused food, but delicious. The staff is very friendly if you approach them, but they wont hound you like other luxury stores.

Every day the cook  has 3 new soups of the day, each being authentic in flavor and then some. Broths to each soup have their own flavor appeal without being too thick and unctuous like Hale and Hearty.

However, their seafood quality has dropped significantly. Also, they really need to talk to the guys who work in the seafood area. They are not friendly and don't communicate properly. Most of them seem grumpy and pissy, and if you ask to see a fish to inspect before buying, they will start hammering and cutting it without your approval. What's the point of buying something if you can not inspect it? It's like you have to buy things at their will and mercy. We are never going to this place again. Buyer be aware and be mindful before buying seafood from this place. What a great day to spend some time in this mart. There so many variety of vegetables and seafood.

Also the sushi is well priced. But their sandwiches are epic too. It isn't Katz deli but their pastrami us alright for the price. Everyone working are also pretty chill and friendly, from the guy making sandwiches, to the crew manning the cashier. Also, very clean eating area and bathroom. This review is strictly for the buffet

What youre seeing here is 26 of overpriced, below average, borderline junk. The only takeaway is that the food was edible.

Im not exaggerating when I say almost nothing in that buffet tastes good. Very unflavored, unseasoned food. So incredibly bland and the worse part is, a plate that weighs 1.5 pounds costs 25.

Wont be coming back anytime soon. The buffet is really good and tasty and they have so many options for food! Cant wait to try the other stuff! If youre a tourist in NYC with a tight budget this deli is a healthy and affordable option to have lunch. Good quality food and service. They have several options.

The lasagna was very tasty and fresh, the grilled salmon was great and the greens are greens.

Plus is very close to Wall Street, metro stations and other attractions. Youve got everything you could ever hope for in his place... tacos, stir fry, sushi, burgers, a salad bar, soups, ramen.. a buffet style bar.. I mean you name it theyve got it. Sure it gets very crowded around lunch time but thats to be expected at a place like this and the lines move very quickly. Never have more than a 10 minute wait. The prices are on the higher side of things but I dont mind too much since everything is fresh and often prepared right in front of you. Plenty of space of dine inside or outside if you please. The place is well lit and clean and staff is friendly and helpful. Probably my number one go to lunch spot. Thanks Open Market... see you soon!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Mulberry Market NYC,"251 Mulberry St, New York, NY 10012, USA",4.2,40.7232282,-73.9958729,"I bought grated Parmesan from this market and when I ate it, it didnt even taste like cheese. It tasted like they cut the Parmesan with cornstarch or something else floury, and put too much, so no Parmesan flavor was left. Do not buy Parmesan from here unless its in bigger pieces where you can clearly see its cheese otherwise youll be eating some mystery powder. Nice place to get something quick, produce is a little light so you wont be doing a lot of grocery shopping but they definitely have enough stuff here and there to get something youll want  might not be exactly what you want though. They do have a good selection of drinks  got a beet juice drink here. WARNING beware of expired products.

I come to mulberry market as I live nearby. It is much more expensive than other grocery stores, but it can make do when i need an apple or ketchup.

Unfortunately, I have not had good luck with perishables. Yogurt is often curdled, milk rancid. Perhaps they have a refrigeration problem. Beautiful and super clean with an very extensive range that seems to be have everything fully stocked, which is reflective as pricing is on the expensive end of the spectrum. I recently had the pleasure of visiting Mulberry Market in New York, and I must say, it was a delightful experience. As an Indian living in New York, finding quality Indian food products can sometimes be a challenge, but Mulberry Market exceeded my expectations.

First and foremost, the store's ambiance is welcoming and wellorganized. It's clear that they take pride in offering a wide range of Indian food products. From spices to readymade meals and fresh produce, they have it all. The quality of their products truly impressed me, and it's evident that they source their items with care.

The staff at Mulberry Market were not only knowledgeable but also friendly. They were more than willing to assist me in finding the specific items I was looking for and even offered suggestions for new things to try. Their helpfulness made my shopping experience enjoyable.

The store is easy to navigate, and the staff is always helpful. I particularly enjoyed their prepared food section, which offers delicious and wholesome options that feel like homecooked meals. While prices may be slightly higher than other grocery stores, I believe the quality of the products justifies the cost. Went to this whole food's as I am a local to pick up some watermelons. Whole foods were adverting it in front of the entrance. I went inside and couldn't find 1 employee. I thought I was in walmart, not Whole Foods! I had to go hunt down an employee through the entire store. I found one. He didn't even help at all. He just shrugged his shoulders and said, ""I don't know if they have any,"" and walked away. Didn't call anyone! Then I went t to customer service same thing. No one cared to look or call to see if they had any in the back. Terrible store  customer service! I found the workers to be extremely lazy. I should have asked for a manager, but I have already wasted so much time. Management needs to really get it together with this store! They're understaffed, and no one is around to help on a Thursday evening? I will post a photo of the advertisement below. I will continue to shop at Trader Joe's, Thrive market  other grocery shops. Whole Foods customer service and quality foods both have gone downhill!

Btw, why is Whole Foods only selling seedless? What is that about! I like Whole Foods they have grapefruit and vegetables and other stuff but don't get their croissants they're terrible if you need a real croissant go to Essex Bakery Well laid out grocery store.  It was easy to find everything I needed.  Staff is helpful. Prices seemed a bit high but that could just be because I don't live in NYC Was there many times, place is clean, welllit and wellarranged. They have tons of flowers in it, beautiful flowers too. Great beer selection, like no where else. Good variety of non alcoholic beers","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Whole Foods Market,"270 Greenwich St, New York, NY 10007, USA",4.4,40.7155877,-74.0114521,"Staff are happy and generally organized. Thats impressive considering the volume the store caters to.  But, always a but, the cleanliness of the floors and especially the second floor dining areas is awful.  Harding anybody cleaning the tables or the windows facing west, full of food.  Definitely something for the management to think about. The actual worst store. Says on their website you can call ahead to place a prepared foods order for pick up like a pizza. When I was finally able to get through to the prepared foods department after my third time being transferred they tell me I have to pay in advance. I call customer service back and then they tell me they dont do call ahead orders  apparently due to being short staffed? Huge bummer because this is the only grocery store in Tribeca  Ill just continue praying that Trader Joes finds real estate nearby soon. I wanted to give one star if it allows, this place is terribly stealing or say robbing client's money and refuse to pay back. My colleagues paid 350 dollars to buy an Amazon gift card from this place, when I redeemed it there is only 25... We didn't expect whole foods would do the ""trick"" as most of you could have read from the internet but they did! It is a gift card and usually ppl won't tell how much is in it to the receiver, luckily my colleague did tell me, gave me the receipt and warned me about this trick they have heard. If it is 0 I would have believed it was a mistake, but it is 25 so I would assume they did that intentionally. More dramatically, I took a picture of the receipt and amazon redeem proof but lost the physical card as the next day I moved house, guess what they insist to see the physical card in order to refund! In most of the big merchants foto copy is the same as physical copy! THEY ARE ROBBING MONEY! Product placement proved to be perplexing as I spent precious time searching for yogurts, only to discover them tucked away behind the vitamin aisle. On a more positive note, the Mediterranean and Hot bar delighted me with their wide variety and freshness. However, the average cost for a medium cup and a box amounted to 21.

My shopping experience took a turn for the worse in the selfcheckout area. There were no clear signs or instructions on how to pay for the items I had selected. In contrast to Target, where selfcheckout is straightforward, I was left baffled and ultimately abandoned my cucumbers and tomatoes at the selfcheckout station. Great market to shop organic food! From produce, meats, seafood, drinks, snacks and even clean and non toxic household products. I loved chocolate cookies and I found my only favorite healthy chocolate chip cookies in wholefoods!

Apart from that, they maintain the cleanliness of the place and offer
fresh meats ans seafood!!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Kam Man Market,"200 Canal St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.2,40.7168163,-73.9984181,"As one of the bigger stores in the neighborhood, New Kam Man has a wider selection of goods than its competitors. The street level has packaged and prepared food while the lower level has kitchen items and a good tea selection. But bigger is not necessarily cheaper and I would encourage you to compare prices at nearby Sun Vin grocery on Mulberry Street. The basement at New Kam Man is just a fun place to go.  They have plates and bowls and teas but also a toy and stationary section.  I grabbed some fun stickers the last time I was there Small takeout food counter at the entrance to the supermarket with big portions, delicious food, and very affordable prices. I had the roast pork over rice for 6.50, and I was contently satisfied. They have some different fruits that I've never seen before . The guavas were huge and great tasting. Will definitely go back and explore. I used to visit this supermarket frequently, that was almost 30 years old. there is little change here so it brought back lots of memories !

I loved the variety of readytoeat meats from their deli department . Also there are stands outside the entrance selling exotic fruits.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 5:50 PM

New York Marts,"75 E Broadway, New York, NY 10002, USA",3.8,40.713685,-73.9941826,"Honestly, it's just another Asian market. Obviously you will find most Chinese products. But American products are more expensive compared to American markets. The place is typical with slightly unpleasant smells due to the fact that they sell fresh seafood and raw meats. Sometimes they have offers that I don't hesitate to take advantage of. Remember to please check the expiration date of the products and even check the product. I once found a package of turkey sausages that were not yet expired but the color and texture of the product was already rotten they probably take little care about the refrigeration of the products Because there are products that should be frozen and are simply on a normal shelf. It's not a bad store, I even shop often but it takes me an hour to check the products making sure they are not damaged before buying They used to sell  cooked soy sauce duck, soy sauce chicken, roast pork, soy sauce squid with food stamps legally, but they don't do it anymore. The prices are great. You can buy a 56oz can of Kikkoman sesame oil for about 25.00. For offbrand sesame oil, you can purchase a can of sesame oil for about 16.00.

The fish is so fresh a lot of fish are still moving.

The food is great, and the Han are superfriendly. You must go there! The place is terrifying, but praces are fine. Sea food is for good prices. Contemporary Asian delicacies ingredients produce dry foods and otherwise. Need to go need to go they don't celebrate only Chinese delicacies other and other Latino an American Just double check when ordering delivery on grocery items. They will say they ran out of certain brands and then give you cheaper brands, while claiming they will be of the same value eg. swapping out 10 bottle of rice wine for a 2 brand. Maybe they think the customers wont know any better. The items arrived in fine condition.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM

55 Fulton Market by Keyfood,"55 Fulton St, New York, NY 10038, USA",4.2,40.7087181,-74.0047186,"What a wonderful supermarket that has everything you want OMG I don't know how to describe my experience here. It's all really that expensive I guess it's because they accept WIC and EBT. The first time I went to buy some frozen chicken and some tomatoes. All right, I self checked out because I paid by credit card. So, all good because it was an in and out. Recently, I went to make some purchases with my WIC card. I was surprised by the price of milk. I made sure through the app that the milk was the one that has approved the wic as benefits for the month of June. Then I reviewed the UPC and the list issued by the APL WIC OF NEW YORK STATE Effective May 30, 2024 So I went to the checkout to pay, In front of me were two Hispanic women with children running around the store. They were waiting and apparently were also doing their shopping with WIC. The cashier swiped my card and declined my payment. I asked him why? If I used the app and checked the WIC OF NYS APL list, He just responded with a vague and disgusted attitude towards me I think because he thought I was Asian He simply said ""I don't know"" Then I asked if he could help me find the milk that the store allows me to buy with wic... He made a few movements with his arms and sighed as if I were bothering him. And I just said ""thank you, I'll put back the milk on his place"".
When I went up the stairs to exit I saw the cashier helping the Hispanic ladies look for the wic approved juice.  Then I saw him attending to them without the same arrogant attitude with which he attended to me. I was really disappointed and I won't come back here.  It seems like he didn't know that I speak Spanish and that I was born in a  country where speak Spanish. I guess because of my Asian appearance he disliked me and he treated me in such a rude way. The most beautifully stocked veggie wall. Always take pride in what u do and this guy def does!!!! High end for key foods.

They have a large variety of deli counter and buffet foods for those working in the area. Its in the back left of the main floor.

Ive yet to try it, but the store had a lot of other things I needed when I took these photos for future reference The issues with this particular Key Food location are the following

Quality We have consistently found expired food on their shelves make sure you always check the dates and their produce is almost always bad.

Pricing This Key Food is much pricier than all of the other local grocery stores including the Whole Foods that's a few blocks away. I found it to be double the price on quite a few items, including yogurt, pasta, and meat items. It doesn't make sense when the quality is this bad. When they do have sales, be careful of what you are getting for that discounted price.

Customer service It's pretty much nonexistent here. Employees don't seem happy here and management is not effective. Nobody seems to care about customers and everytime we come here, there are ridiculous lines.

Meat weights The meat department doesn't weigh their meats properly so be careful or you may find yourself paying a lot extra for low quality meat.

Cleanliness and Organization This store is just not clean and it's common to find things disorganized, out of place, etc.

After years of this being one of our neighborhood markets, we have decided to no longer shop here.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Jubilee Market Place on John,"99 John St, New York, NY 10038, USA",4.2,40.7082431,-74.0063359,"You would never  in 1 million years  expect to see a place like this. And what I mean by ""like this"" is the fact that it offers all fivestar, unbelievable, completely fresh prepared food in a wellmaintained buffet environment at 11.99 a pound. As you walk around the store, it's shocking to see that some of the prices are less expensive than in Westchester County. It might be because of the proximity to Chinatown, but you'll see some photos, like turmeric in perfect pieces for 5.99 per pound. Good luck finding that price anywhere. Period. The entryway makes it look so unassuming that if you dont know its there, you would probably never walk in. But please trust me, it is definitely worth the visit. Need help answering the phone.  They took entirely to long to come back to the phone so I hung up and called back.  When the young lady that answered the phone the first time picked it up again she says rudely that they are busy and I have to hold again.  She never even asked me what I wanted to order.  Terrible attitude and poor customer service.  Just be nice to people.  It cost you nothing and goes a long way.  I'll find another place to spend my money. I've been going here for years. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. Never  had a issue with my purchases. Food is always fresh and delicious. I keep coming back because it's familiar and I know I won't be disappointed. I would definitely recommend them for the food and service. Omg the Sushi rolls they have are the fresh and tasty roll I have had in NYC! So so so very yummy! If you like California roll and or any kind of rolls like that then it is a total must try. Sooooo freaken good! Yummy yummy! I am going back for more this week to clean off the plate. Happy Eating!

Whole Foods Market,"66 Broadway, New York, NY 10005, USA",4.3,40.7071125,-74.0119287,"I visited the new Daily shop in its first week. I was amazed how much product they had. Their prices are comparable to my store in Washington state. Saw a few things that were even cheaper. 29 cents for a bottle of 365 water! Never seen that in any WFM before.
The supervisor in produce was a great guy and very friendly! Even posed for a photo for me to share with my coworkers.  This was one of 4 whole foods I visited in NY and PA. I have to be honest, at the Daily Shop location, the customer service at the self checkout really lacked friendliness compared to the others. They were helpful though. I understand this was NY. Im sure the team members were tired with the new opening and the previous work of setting up. And what do I know? Maybe New Yorkers arent even bothered!?! Whole Foods Market in downtown NYC is a topnotch grocery destination! Everything here is incredibly fresh, from the vibrant produce to the wellstocked shelves. The fruits look especially amazingripe, colorful, and bursting with flavor. The store is clean, wellorganized, and offers a fantastic variety of organic and specialty items. The staff is friendly and helpful, making the shopping experience even better. Whether youre looking for fresh ingredients or just want to browse, Whole Foods in downtown NYC never disappoints. Highly recommended for quality and freshness! A very clean and versatile store. You wont be disappointed if youre looking for something healthy and fresh. And they have a cafe area where you can sit back and enjoy your purchased food! Its a nice place to go to in New York City I recently visited the Whole Foods store, and I must say, I have mixed feelings about the experience. The store itself is impressively large, with a spacious and clean layout that makes navigating through the aisles quite pleasant. However, I was disappointed by the limited options available for groceries. Despite the store's size, the selection didn't meet my expectations, especially when it came to certain staples and specialty items.

Another downside is the pricing. As expected with Whole Foods, the products are on the pricier side. While I don't mind paying a bit more for quality, the high prices here don't seem justified given the lack of variety.

Overall, while the store is aesthetically pleasing and wellmaintained, the limited options and high prices make it hard to justify regular shopping trips here. Nice, clean supermarket with good turnover of products. The ground floor has plants and food that you could pick up onthego. Nice pizza and sushi selection as well. Downstairs is more your grocery area. There's a seating area where you could eat the lunch you just picked up there's also a microwave for your use. If you have to return any Amazon packages, the return area is next to the sitting area. The grocery selection is nice though at times a little narrow and sometimes confusing almost a mini labyrinth. It's also cool that you could pick up fresh bread AND get it sliced automatically with the bread slicing machine.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

New Yorkers Foodmarket,"107 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003, USA",3.9,40.727772,-73.988687,"In the middle of the Ukrainian Village is this family owned supermarket offering high quality food items at very reasonable cost.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, and they deliver to the East Village.  They are located near NYU and are known for their delicious Roast beef sandwich, and don't forget the Carrot and raisin salad. An absolute dump. One positive thing I could say is, they have a decent selection of cheeses and belobe you me I am being extremely generous here. My family and I have shopped at this supermarket for over 30 years. The owner is truly dedicated to the community and treats his customers like family. The store is wellrun and provides high quality, very local service, including quick efficient delivery up east village walkups. The staff are courteous and helpful. Many of the staff are very longterm employees, a clear testament to the owners fair treatment. We need to be supportive of our local businesses to keep the services and warmth of spirit that define the East  Village. Ive been going to this market for years and yes, it is overpriced, but its New York, its going to be, its clean and convenient for me so I still go. However their staff is unfriendly, especially the guy with brown hair, he seems like he might be an owner. Just unfriendly. It makes shopping there just uncomfortable. Ive seen him behave in a rude manner to many of his customers before and its really off putting. Id rather take the walk down to another grocery store if I have the time. Their doors to get into the market are also always broken, or move so slowly its borderline comical. With all of the extra money theyre making from charging what they charge they should make it a priority to fix their doors. Its literally the first impression of the store. Then they need to fix the owners attitude, look how they respond to reviews on here. Its unfriendly and rude. It's a complete ripoff, I bought 3 cans of Le Croix just sparkling water with a hint of fruit extract and it was 12 dollar! A single can is at whole foods for example around a dollar. A 12 pack around 6 dollar. And on the can there were a 30 cent deposit but you just get back 5, they couldn't explain me why. I am not an American so I didn't knew about the product and pricing but I learned it is way cheaper in other stores. So I don't trust this store...","Monday: 9:00 AM – 7:00 PM

If they spent even a quarter of the time removing expired produce and meats from the shelves that they spend stalking me each trip the store would be worth the insane markups. Also their membership card has yet to save me a single penny and I have thousands of unusable points lol Pretty solid place for buying all kinds of produce, meat, or other food items you typically find in a grocery store. The prices are quite decent too relative to the area. I think they redid the place in the past couple years. Last time I was there the staff was snappy and the place looked like it was falling apart.
My visit today was great! They have a good selection of products, produce, meats everything is well stocked, organized and clean. The staff is friendly a worker checked in with me to make sure I found everything I needed.
They even have fresh juices and coffee for a dollar? Im impressed.
Great improvements  What a clean, organized, great customer service support, I experienced in the New York Marketplace. I enjoyed their Beets, Orange, and Carrot Juice, that they make fresh on a daily basis. Delicious! They also have a deli, so you can order your cold cuts, ect. They have everything like a Super market! I love their freshly squeezed juice machine, super clean and delicious fresh juices every day. Great pricing and products but above all...exceptional service. Everyone in there is hospitable and welcoming. They're always routinely working to keep the store clean and organized. I shop there as opposed to the large grocery chains as I firmly believe in supporting grassroots, local establishments.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM

I called a couple minutes later and it said that they're not there? Weird. This place was wonderful and captivating! I thanked your staff for answering my questions if ever I have any concerns. The cashiers are all active and speedy in doing their work. When it comes to the environment, it is all organized and tidy. You didn't fail to amaze your customers, guys. Until next time! Highly recommended grocery shop! Love this grocery store, they carry a lot of products and brands that I Iove. Only problem I have with them is that their hours are like corporate office hours, Weekdays 8 to 5, closed on holidays. So if you work office hours and youre not nearby, you pretty much have to a take a leave just to do grocery shopping.. Great selection of SouthEast Asian products and items! I was looking for galangal, belachan, and good oyster sauce and found them all there! I got lemongrass as well, but it wasn't as fresh. Take it From an Aussie when I say many southeast Asian curry pastes are very hard to find in Manhattan. You have to explore but this place has a great range of hard to finds laksa pastes, rendangs, heaps of red, green and yellow curry pastes.
Also a good 3040 cheaper than places further uptown.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM

Are you kidding me?!?! How is that even allowed?!? That is the definition of Absurd. Will not be returning to this overpriced place. Delicious breakfast sandwiches and chai lattes, reasonably priced too Friendly staff. Pricy and small market but it seems to fill a niche not otherwise well served over in the mall. The coffee isn't strong in a latte, but the flavor and quality seem fine. They have a few fresh baked goods, and more packaged stuff. It would be fine for tabbing a quick lunch or some snacks. There's not enough bike parking around the mall generally. The perfect place to enjoy a meal at any time of the day, the prices are really comfortable.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The staff where at the cashier or at the deli counter are friendly and helpful.
The aisles can feel cramped but their well stocked and up to date. They have lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and a decent Asian food section especially for kimchi.
The deli counter is great I personally recommend their French Toast. French fries its best to check to see if theyre available so dont get your hopes up.
They also carry an extensive pastry and muffins as well Owner is extremely disrespectful and rude, he curses and disrespects you. Would NEVER spend a dime here. Definitely wouldn't buy the flowers, don't think about a photo of the flowers he will curse you out and call you names for doing such. I had a terrible experience at this place. They displayed a price for payment in cash, but charged an additional surcharge at the register if paying with a card  any card. I feel like I was ripped off and will never return there again. I strongly advise others to avoid this place or beware of their devious surcharges. Do not order food from this deli I so rats inside .also People behind the food counter are disrespectful their are always in bad mood.","Monday: 5:30 AM – 11:30 PM

I don't know what he's doing to these real fruit slushies but honey baby let me tell you, we purchased a large and it was so good i literally went back the same day to get another one. The hours say 8am to 7pm on google but he told me 10am to 11pm. See ya next trip! Oh and it's 23 Canal St. Not 25 Pretty interesting spot to get fresh fruit slush. You pay and then grab a number tag and wait. There was a little line.. since its summer time!

Watermelon one, super refreshing! GOKUUUU 

Wow there is a lot to love is this fun endcap to the street. Im just a little happier and better after browsing their selection of healthy treats and options. I even bought something!!

This conveyor belt sparked some interest in me. I really wish I had a chance to use it but unfortunately was running late Im getting new siding for my shed

Regular size is 5 I would like to give negative for this store. They left their cat out which pounced on my dog. Then the female owner had the audacity to blame it on me and yell at me for her cat pouncing on my dog. The male owner was nice and apologized but the female owner sent me over the edge.

Pricing on the shelves for produce wasnt too accurate. But no we do not have regular bananas, only organic for 1.29  lb. Then I found out they are owned by ShopRite. I used to work near to this market, so I started to buy my lunch everyday. Most of the time I took food from the buffet, but I also asked for fried chicken or sushi. Isnt cheap and sometimes the food tastes different even if it is the same plate than other days. Picked up a reisling and lunch. The sushi looked great, will try that next time.  Cookies were delicious and the quinoa salad was fresh and surprisingly good.  Came with a nice dressing on the side. Oh my god. I frequent this place so often that I've never bothered to write a reviewuntil today. The sheer number of times I've bought spoiled items from here is outrageous! Truffle mayo, fish, milk, eggsyou name it, they've sold it rotten. Today was the last straw. I went to pick up some hummus for dinner, and as I was leaving, I noticed blue ink all over my expensive shirt, my hands, and my arms. I had no idea where it came from until I looked at the hummus. THE LID WAS LEAKING BLUE INK!!
They claimed they'd never seen that before, but I knew they were lying. I went back to the hummus section and saw HALF THE HUMMUS CONTAINERS WERE LIKE THAT!
Absolutely horrendous. They REFUSED to pay for the damage to my shirt and the dermatologist appointments I had to schedule to fix the rashes caused by the toxic ink.
Never again. This place is a nightmare. Avoid at all costs. This place sucks, always check the expiration dates and food itself because its probably not safe to eat. Also relatively expensive and the staff are probably underpaid and dont seem to care about providing a good shopping experience.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 9:00 PM

  Well stocked store and very clean

 I picked up fresh packaged Thai basil, Kefir lime leaves, and Thai eggplant. I picked up coconut milk, bamboo shoots, oyster sauce, Thai soy sauce, black soy sauce, and fish sauce.

 Highly recommend. The store owner was very knowledgeable and gave great advice for some cooking methods and which products would be best for the dishes I was making. One of my favorite place in the city!
Definitely my go to every I have to cook a Thai dish and I always get so much stuff that I cook Thai for days!
This place is just amazing  you can find everything you cannot find in the other grocery store and I like to support small businesses

Also they are very friendly and kind
Very recommended Wonderful  well stocked Thai grocery store! As a clean freak, I love how all the fresh produce is packaged in plastic nicely 

Lots of different sauces, curry pastes, dried and fresh ingredients! I got ingredients to make a Thai papaya salad  lovely peanut snack from my childhood 

Also, the cashier Im pretty sure she was the owner was SO sweet, helpful and kind. I regret not getting her name today  but if youre reading this, thank you for your help  I will definitely return to support her local business! Best place to get your Thai groceries. Staff is super friendly. Been going here for years and still going strong. Feels great to support local businesses like this. I come here for all my Thai grocery needs.

Trader Joe's,"233 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.7,40.7257485,-74.0048949,"Leaving this review because I want Angel M. to take this as a learning experience.

Today I decided to come to Trader Joes because I was looking for a quick and healthy snack as I havent eaten anything since the afternoon. So as I usually would, I wanted to try something new before I bought. Since Trader Joes allows it supposedly. I decided to grab something new as I always buy my usual go tos oatmeal, fruit, Greek yogurt. I stumbled and saw that Trader Joes sells macaroons so I decided Why not?

Upon checking out is where everything went downhill. I asked my cashier Angel M, if I can try the Macaroons before I bought them and he said I could not as that wasnt part of the policy. I was so confused as I was able to do this with another staff member and he didnt give me a problem about it. In fact, I also did this same request in the Brooklyn Trader Joes on Court street. Despite what he told me, I kindly asked him if he could bring his manager to figure out why I couldnt try the macaroons.

He told me no and that he said he had to do his job, which was to ring me out first so I can try. It wasnt about what he said but the WAY he spoke to me. I honestly hated it and I understood where he was coming from. I kept asking him to bring his manager and still would not want to budge. So I decided to get Matthew, the store manager, myself. And after I brought over the manager to us, Angel suddenly said that he was going to get my manager. When he clearly said that to make himself look good.

The store manager was able to resolve my issue and ended up not charging me for the macaroons. But now I feel like I was mistreated because Angel didnt want to get his manager. He simply wanted to do his job.

I hope he learns from this as I love to shop at Trader Joes. But now from this experience, I dont feel super stoked about coming into a Trader Joes store.

TLDR
Wanted to try before you buy policy but couldnt for some reason.
Staff didnt want to grab manager for me so I grabbed him myself to resolve the issue. Ive had this same burrito from here and from the TJs by my house in LI. Inconsistent taste, the one from LI is 1 less and tastes better. The tangerine probiotic drink is pretty good with ice. Convenient from my job. An incredible place to go shopping for groceries.

I was particularly impressed with their affordable organic options and the wide range of flavors that you won't find in your typical grocery store.

Whether it's their delicious frozen meals, fresh produce, or quirky snacks, there's always something exciting to discover at Trader Joe's.

Plus, the layout and organization of the store made it easy to find everything I needed.

Their privatelabel products and friendly staff exceeded my expectations, which keeps me coming back for more. It is a Trader Joes it cant do wrong!
The store is very organized and pretty busy in the evenings. There are so many varieties of products. Will recommend if interested in trying out good quality products for a reasonable price. Love love their bread selections. Spacious store, wonderful selection, affordable prices, beautiful and organized presentation, helpful and kind staff. Quality products and fresh produce. Also the restroom is convenient and location is great. Always love shopping at Trader Joes.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Unfortunately i was so lost in how cool this store was, i could only get a picture of the bottom two floors and not the top one  where i bought all my things . The staff here have provided me and my family with the best customer service that i personally have ever received. Especially a worker named Ryan although im not sure if i spelled his name right. He was very nice to me and my brother and helped us get our names embroidered on our hats  he also helped us curve the brim of our hats. Although it did take a while, the store is so huge and theres so many things to view and do there that I couldve waited longer. This store has merch for EVERY nba team as well as WNBA teams  a few college teams such as micheal jordans jersey in north carolina. Although it was a little crowded at times, i would say that this store is a MUST visit if you play basketball, or are a fan of the NBA, WNBA, or college basketball, they have many clothing choices from tee shirts, to shirts, to sweaters with zippers, to hoodies, to thin jackets, to varsity jackets, and basically everything. I spent at least 3 hours in this store and i rate it a 10010, definitely recommend Very cool store with clothing for men women and children with all NBA and WNBA teams. Memorabilia toys and collectibles. Customization of hats shoes and jerseys. ProsBeautiful store, very organized, three or four floors filled with inventory, elevator and escalator access

Cons they did not carry certain items we were looking for, for such a big store,. And of course, prices are pretty steepit is 5th ave.. We were told there was no restroom and we were paying customers. The NBA Store on 5th Avenue is a mustvisit for any basketball fan! The selection of products is incredible, with everything from the latest gear to a fantastic collection of oldschool jerseys that brought back so many memories. The store is wellorganized, making it easy to find exactly what youre looking for. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, always ready to help with a smile. Whether youre a diehard fan or just looking for a cool gift, this store has it all. Highly recommend stopping by!

Rigor Hill Market,"227 W Broadway, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.3,40.7192251,-74.0059952,"Quaint neighborhood caf and mini grocery with fresh produce. The egg sandwich was freshly made with wellbalanced flavors. The turkey sandwich however was premade and I found it underwhelming relative to the price at 16. Made a great choice buying the pear crme fraiche ice cream which was divine. Topped it with dark chocolate shavings and potato chips. Pretty chill atmosphere especially on a warm spring day.

Some of the staff felt stand offish though. They seem selective as to who they think deserves warmer service or youre just there because of the TikTok craze which isnt the case for me, my friend who lives in the neighborhood just told me about it.

Anyway, will keep hanging out here and try more of their soups and grilled chicken. Sandwiches are definitely a bit overpriced but the breakfast sando was delicious. Highly recommend! Def get the ones that are made to order BEC, BLT vs the premade ones. The coffee is also very good. After the 3rd visit for hot chocolate I can give the full honest review
This place is so cute and Im glad its in the neighborhood! The hot chocolate is one of the best Ive had and I do global reviews of that drink so Ive had a few and the marshmallows 
Just perfect for winter. Love it.

There was a different flavor to the chocolate itself on the 2nd visit, we think it might have happened because we came in right at closing time that day  the marshmallows balanced out the weird flavor but without them we wouldnt have been able to drink it. The taste was sour and it wasnt like that at all during the first and third visits. Still giving it five stars because when its good its truly THE BEST. I do hope the team reads this and finds out if the quality changes during specific dayshours maybe after 3pm the hot chocolate is tired and needs a break from being so amazing? so go earlier  Service at the counter was friendly. The fresh melon juice was delicious, albeit 10.50 for a small pour. But the real disappointment was the  BLT. This sandwich was one of those meal regrets where you have to have a second lunch to make up for the disappointment. Bread was barely toasted and too dense. The tomatoes were good. Bacon and lettuce decent. But the bread and poor ratios made it a mess. Saw the 1010 Score from hot cocoa girl idk her name Im so sorry on TikTok and knew I had to check this place out. Super cute with lots of fresh produce for purchase inside. Food menu looked nice and the food I saw coming out that other people ordered looked great. Had a nice cooler of drinks and spreads for purchase. We only got the hot cocoa and it was super rich and enjoyable. Definitely a lavish treat and super delicious.

Trader Joe's,"400 Grand St Cellar, New York, NY 10002, USA",4.6,40.7164903,-73.9867718,"This is my favorite grocery store! The store policy on purchases is very customer centric. If a customer is unhappy about a purchase, the managers will make it right either through a refund or replacement. The management and staff are friendly and helpful too. The Grand Street store is clean and spacious. There are always cart handle wipes available. They carry a large assortment of organic foods. New products are introduced every week or two. Generally, the prices are pretty reasonable. In general, I wish they carried more vegan products.

It's important to note that each store is different. The Trader Joe's on 22nd  6th Ave and 14th Street are awful! Both are very busy and small, so maneuvering with a cart is somewhat difficult. Also, the store on 22nd Street never provides cart handle wipes for customers. The dispenser is always empty or broken! This place is huge .. lots of choices on all kinds of foods and deals. AMAZING PLACE ! I LOVE IT! AND MOST  OF ALL THE WORKERS ARE PHENOMENAL AND THE CASHIERS ARE THE BEST!  THEY ARE VERY HOSPITABLE N MAKE YOU FEEL AT HOME. I WILL CONTINUE TO GO HERE EVEN IF I AM MILLIONS OF MILES AWAY! THANK YOU GUYS SEE YOU SOON! Always a beautiful, healthy, looking lovely selection of flowers to greet you as you walk in off of the elevator.

Not sure if they were aware but the stair were unsafe. It was difficult to see where the edge of the steps were as you walk down. I glad they finally fixed the escalator.

Easy return had some spoiled lemon after a few days. Came in making my purchase and was able to return and deduct the difference from my purchase. Requires manager to process transaction. I don't get this place. Going down that escalator is like descending into California lots of hypergroomed 20somethings in gym clothes. You could weigh the amount of sheer entitlement present in this store in pounds...
BUT....the food is great, the prices are very low, and the store employees are overall extremely friendly and very helpful. Oh, and the line always moves quickly.
It's great, fresh food at very low prices what are all the kids shopping here so angry about?? If you can stomach the clientele, this is a great store!","Monday: 8:00 AM – 9:00 PM

57 Bayard Meat Market,"57 Bayard St A, New York, NY 10013, USA",4,40.7153055,-73.9978216,"I love shopping here. Its almost never crowded, the meat selection is fresh and abundant, and they carry all your basic Asian pantry items and fresh produce. Selection isnt as huge or as diverse as larger markets but I prefer the simplicity of that. Everything is also very fresh and wellpriced. Next to the meat market, they also have the fresh seafood and fresh produce.

The fresh veggies are abundant. Like the kangkung or water spinach and fresh bean sprout.

They also have lots of fresh meat as well as prepared and cooked food. Mostly spicy Cantonese food. You can buy them packed or per pound. I wanted to try cooking Chinesestyle chicken feet at home and was looking for a grocery store that sells them.  And this place does!  pics  Yay.  So yeah, if you're looking for a grocery store in NYC that sells chicken feet...they do.

The fresh veggie selection is pretty solid as well.... The best prices for pork I have found in the city. The pork is great quality as wellit has turned out excellently every time I cooked it. While I am usually the only nonChinese person in the store, the staff speaks English and the whole community is very welcoming.

Purchases under 10 must be made with cash, and you can buy a decent amount of meat for under 10, so keep this in mind.

The store often has specials going on as well and these are a nice bonus. I did buy some large chicken legs on a special and they were huge, concerningly so, almost the size of small turkey legs. Admittedly, this made me wonder where the large chicken legs are being sourced from. Small chicken legs are available, however, though I have not purchased them, but I have had the pork shoulder, pork loin, and ground pork, and they have all been great. They also have pork neck bones which are an under appreciated find! I bought soy sauce chicken pre cooked here. I got diarhea. It didn't smell right .","Monday: 9:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Top Hops Beer Shop,"88 Essex St, New York, NY 10002, USA",4.5,40.7180905,-73.9881476,"They have the best beer in the world here! had a summer Ale from Transmitter, a local brewery across the East River and a great example of the American craft beer movement.  The bartender deserves a 50 star rating! Whoever said the she was xenophobic against Americans, clearly had no idea what this great nation is really about. Her keen knowledge of the produce of our nations brewers and her communication of the craft of brewing, truly represents the independent spirit of our nations founders.  Washington, Hamilton, Franklin and rest would be proud and happy to be served a pint here! Stopped in to the Essex Market today after a long ish walk from Tribeca. Greeted by a rather impressive collection of craft beers, I sat down and asked the bartender, I think her name was Lauren what hazys she had on top. She responded with an unexpected yet very welcomed astuteness of beer knowledge, which led to more conversation. As a craft beer lover, this was perhaps the most pleasant part of a weeklong journey through NYC. Im from the west coast and she knew so much about even beers there plus filled me in on so many upcoming brewers and beers on the east coast, and helped guide me in my quest to find a coveted Treehouse beer which still eludes eludes me  Prost, Cheers and Salute to Top Hops and especially Lauren who made the experience review worthy.  Came in to Essex Market while visiting my son, a long time New Yorker. We stopped for a rest and a beverage. The bartender was absolutely a delight Lauren.  She happens to be from Australia but made me feel comfortable, at home, and delighted with the experience. This is the perfect place to sit and have a beer while shopping in the market. The bartender is quite knowledgeable about all their offeringslagers, ipas, stouts, sours, ciders, even wineand can suggest exactly what you're craving. While it's placed among food stalls and other shops in the large market space, it feels like your local joint friendly and neighborly. The beer was great, good local selection although the signage didnt match what was actually available  probably due to next point!. The bartender was horrible, xenophobic towards Americans and lazy, very rude not only to us but every interaction I observed her with. She made it clear we were a bother by being there.","Monday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM

This is just plain wrong. Go with your elders when they shop so they dont get scammed. And dont go here anymore in general lol My family has been coming here for years, which makes this even more disappointing. Not only was I given the wrong information by the employee, but I was also a sold rancid product.

Earlier this week I went to purchase some vegetarian  bean curd wraps, I asked the employee if it was vegetarian and she told me yes. As a vegan this was something I was looking forward to eating. When I come home to cook it not only do I find out that there is pork inside of it, but when my family ate it the wraps had a sour rancid taste.
I don't understand how the employees could've not know that this product had meat and was rancid.
I spent 10 on something that went into the trash. The store on Mott's street cashier's are so rude. They kept talking nonsense to each other while making customers wait? Seriously they make us Chinese people look bad. My friends from outside NYC refuse to go there because the cashier's were rude. Making customers wait 10 minutes while the cashier's talk nonsense to each other? I love going to this meat store. It's clean, well organized, and most importantly, the butchers are very friendly. I love getting prepared duck from them. It's 12 for an entire duck. Can't beat the value! This place is getting weird.
They are tricking you to buy more than what you need.
They would tell you that they no longer cut the amount of meat you want, instead of 1lb of meat you want, you end up buying 3lbs of the whole chunk.

Its also kinda hard to find loose jalapeos so I appreciate that they offer them here. Theyre often sold in bundles that are too big. Located inside Essex market. Essex Farm Fruits  Vegetables is a grocery within the new Essex Market location.

Essex Farm is a fairly grocery space within Essex Market. the grocery has a large selection of vegetables, fruits, herbs, etc. and the produce is fresh and the quality is great. finding common veggies and notsocommon ones was a nice surprise. i was able to find Persian Israeli cucumbers for a Jerusalem Salad that I wanted to make. The parsley and mint smelled so good and were NOT wilted. The tomatoes were nice and  red  and had that fresh firm taste of summer. most of the produce section  is a large are tucked in the back and spreads out from there. if you cook often or want quality veggies, then make a list and come to this spot.

beyond fruits  veggies, there are aisles and shelves of packaged and canned foods. there is a dairy and refrigerated  frozen packaged foods as well. the rest of Essex Farm can fill most of your grocery and supermarket needs.

the prices are fairly walletfriendly in terms of veggies and fruits.

the staff is pretty helpful and finding things can be a little bit of search if you are a firsttimer as the space is packed.

drops mic cuz i eat fresh This place is awesome everything you for Puerto Rican and Dominican. Ingredients for your food A little pricey but a great selection of nondairy and plant based products. ","Monday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM

SuperFresh,"5 St James Pl, New York, NY 10038, USA",3.8,40.7108765,-74.0002319,"I never post reviews unless I have strong feelings about an establishment that future visitors should know. When this place was a Ctown it had good deals. Last month I visited the new ""Super fresh"" for the first time, just curious how the market has changed. There was nothing super or fresh about the place. Since I didn't see anything I needed or wanted to buy, I started to exit the market. An older worker, whom I assumed was the owner or manager, stopped me at the door and asked ""You didn't buy anything?"" I said no. Then he accused me of STEALING  ""You didn't take any merchandise?"" and looked at my bag. Just because I chose not to buy anything from your lowstocked, dealless, and below average store, doesn't mean I am a thief. OMG!!!  Everyone at the registers were looking, I have never been so embarrassed and traumatized and angry obviously. I'm never patronizing this store ever again, and neither should you!!!  The cashiers are friendly, there is a variety of products but sadly they are very expensive for me. Everything is well organized but I have caught one or another expired product on the shelves  I often come here to shop because they serve well and there is an adorable child who helps bag the products which in other establishments they do not help you even if you make purchases of 300 or more I still recommend coming here because it's acceptable, they also have a newspaper with weekly offerspromotions but it's  usually products that I don't need to buy at the moment. Solid stock and selection across the board. This is the best general purpose supermarket in the immediate vicinity to the neighborhood and definitely bound to be the most well priced option since the others are much closer to the financial district. Im pretty sure their grill is open from the beginning of the day well into the afternoon so if youre looking for a breakfast sandwich or a made to order lunch youve got a good shot are getting what youre after. Good selection of produce and even some ready to eat salads make this a good stop for most peoples needs. Accepting contactless payment methods is a major plus for me as well. Good for quick stops, in and out... Not a GREAT variety of brands, but very moderately sensible prices.  Taking advantage of their reasonable sales weekly, is a great way to save even more cash... EBT Accepted. Beware!!!    there are no  prices at the  deli   which is required by  law. The  TV screens   which displays the  prices have not worked  in 5 months  . They  charge  whatever. The  deli  person was  looking up  prices on his cell  phone . In 1 week the price for  bologna  changed 3  times   from 9.99 lb to 11.99lb to 13.99lb .  what  is the tru  price??? When  i   question the price  he  changed the  price  and added a  new  sticker over  the  previous  one  .  Aweful   and  criminal","Monday: 7:00 AM – 8:45 PM

I found the prices just right for the location and the type of shop it was. I had a great experience and the rep behind the counter took extra care of my sensitive items. I recommend 1010. Good place to buy souvenirs. They have lots of stuff!!  Gave it a 3 star because it is pricey.  Shop around if you have time lots of places have same stuff different prices.   I went ahead and purchased some items, did not have time to go to other stores.

Had to come back in and give it a 2 instead of a 3 star. And thats being nice.  I purchased what I thought was a pair of rain boots.  Staff said I give you good price .  Ok I fell for it  went to put in rain boots . Its two right feet!!!!!!!!! Fun to look around this shop as they have tons of tourist gifts under one roof and the official branding of I  NY which makes a nice gift bag, but most items can be found just blocks away 3040 cheaper so let the buyer beware. Awesome place to buy gifts from NYC
Very welcomed helpful staffs. My only problem is  the prices of most of the items are high, I guess because the location is super convenient!! Good souvenir of NY! Not so impressive but cool stuff. I loved the collection in the shop! I actually visited the shop to pick a keychain, end up buying something else, as I was not satisfied with the quality of the keychains. I felt the items are pricey for the quality. Most of its stuff is coffe mugs, cups, t shirts, hoodies, fridge magnets, key chains, travel bags, umbrellas, car dashboard decors, water bottles, caps, etc. Most of the items are in a price range of 6 to 30. One can pick a cool item around 15. The staff paid a friendly welcome, and were nice throughout.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Memories of New York,"206 5th Ave, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.7,40.74321,-73.988793,"We had such a wonderful experience! The owner is one of the kindest, sweetest people we've ever met. Not only did he make sure we were well taken care of, but he even surprised us with some beautiful small gifts. We cant recommend this place enough  we'll definitely be back!"" The owner is an amazing soul. I wish I couldve bought more things. Very kind man, and I wish him the best for this store. Please visit, me and my wife were really happy that we walked into his store instead of the thousands of other stores in New York. Came to this place after reading reviews online, and one thing I kept reading was about the store owner and how nice he was! Well after visiting I will say he is really one of the kindest ppl I met in New York, he gave us a free bag and a bunch of gift stickers and post cards, and hes so nice and appreciative of his customers. It was such a great experience and we are very happy and definitely will recommend it to friends who visit or want souvenirs! Read previous positive reviews before my first visit on 09282024 to this store. I have to admit great experience, good quality products and the managerowner was a very pleasant person to meet. Just simply amazing and I wish I had more time just to chat and learn a bit about his beginnings in the business. Just amazing how he has been in business for a long time in the heart of  downtown NYC. Thank you sir and wish you continue success. Best of best. There are so many gift options. Prices are quite okay compare to other gift shops. Owner is super super kind and helpful person. If you are looking to buy something from New York, this is the place.

MoMA Design Store,"81 Spring St A, New York, NY 10012, USA",4.5,40.7228345,-73.9980444,"By fluke I came across the Design Store. What a great experience. My wallet took a little bit of a beating as I bought a few special gifts for myself.
Everything is fun, clever, colourful and beautifully designed.
Some pieces are iconic and others mainstream. Loved the Andy Warhol collection.
A must visit while in New York.
Notes not wheelchair accessible. Kid friendly. Staff are exceptional. Parking is challenging on the street. A must see for tourists and even locals! It is a perfect spot for unique housewarming presents and gifts for kids and adults. Such a fun, colorful, 2 floor design store, for window shopping, along with MOMA exclusive 'omg this is SO cute' fun, colorful housewares and gadgets. We spend a long time just playing and tinkering with everything. Love this store, even more than the one at the museum. Member discounts still apply here! Expect tourist museum priced items.

Have fun!! Super clean place. Ideally stepped in to break from crowds for a bit, but ended up seeing really cool pieces of furniture and art to be able to still take home if youre a tourist! Love the store! So many cool unique items I'm appreciated the staff helping my friend and I to get the item we wanted. However, my personal opinion, some of the items here are overpriced. I know it is an innovation and arts piece but for me it is overpriced anyway. I took my friend here because she wanted to buy stuff for her future parent in law but if you have more time I think you can fine gift better than spend extra on brand.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Statue of Liberty Museum Store,"1 Liberty Island - Ellis Island, New York, NY 10004, USA",4.2,40.6901179,-74.0461611,"The Statue of Liberty Museum, located on Liberty Island, offers visitors an immersive and inspiring experience that complements the iconic monument. Here's an overview of its key features and overall appeal

Exhibits and Layout
The museum is welldesigned and laid out in a way that allows visitors to explore the history, symbolism, and impact of the Statue of Liberty at their own pace. There are three main sections

Immersive Theater Experience This short film sets the tone for the visit, covering the statue's conception, design, and the complex process of bringing it to life. The audiovisual experience is engaging, providing historical context and emotional resonance.

Engagement Gallery This part of the museum dives into the various interpretations and significance of liberty and freedom. It includes personal stories and artifacts that reflect the global symbolism of the statue. Interactive displays allow visitors to connect with the statues enduring legacy.

The Inspiration Gallery The highlight here is the original torch, a stunning and iconic piece that visitors can see up close. The gallery also offers panoramic views of the statue and Manhattan, adding to the grandeur of the experience.

Educational Value
The museum does an excellent job of educating visitors about the statues origins, including the engineering marvel behind its construction and its role as a symbol of freedom and democracy. There is also a focus on the immigrant experience and the changing perceptions of liberty through the years.

Interactive Elements
Interactive exhibits allow visitors to engage with the material in a handson way, such as using touchscreens to explore different aspects of the statues history or creating digital ""pledges"" to liberty. This makes the experience appealing to both adults and children.

Accessibility
The museum is highly accessible, with ramps, elevators, and other accommodations for visitors with mobility challenges. Audio guides and information panels are available in multiple languages, making it inclusive for an international audience.

Atmosphere
The museums modern design and its location on Liberty Island offer an atmosphere that feels both respectful of history and forwardlooking. The surrounding views of the New York Harbor, Manhattan skyline, and the Statue of Liberty herself contribute to a reflective and uplifting experience.

Overall Experience
The Statue of Liberty Museum enriches the visit to Liberty Island, offering a deep, thoughtful, and interactive way to understand one of Americas most iconic symbols. Whether youre a history buff, a firsttime visitor, or someone looking to understand the statues place in todays world, the museum has something to offer everyone. The lady needs a bath! Other than that, beautiful scenic spot. Try to avoid evening time as the sunlight might be right behind the statue. Needs better ventilation for bathroom . Obviously it's a touristy thing to do, but my girlfriend's parents wanted to go, so we went. And it was fine. It's super narrow on the stairs, so if you're claustrophobic it may not be for you. I don't see all the hype about the torch, to be honest, but whatever. The staff was all super nice and friendly, I was pleasantly surprised. Where's Harriet Tubman's 20 bill?  You sure could use a facsimile of her bill in this store along with your other dollar bills.  There's no American who better represents our Lady Liberty than Ms. Tubman.  I'm sure it will be a bestseller.  I'd buy it.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 6:30 PM

I Love NY Gifts by Phantom of Broadway,"581 5th Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4,40.7567451,-73.9781086,"Don't buy in this store. They steal your money. The price tag and the price at the cash are not the same. I was supposed to pay 27 and I actually payed 50. They also make sure to not speak clearly at the cash, so you don't understand how much you're supposed to pay. Didn't wanna to be rude and so after asking twice the total, I payed.
I suggest to go buy souvenirs at Chinatown or Brooklyn Bridge, it is much cheaper and there are many other things. I also buyed at the 5th Avenue store and it happened pretty much the same thing. Good price, but
They charge 3.8 extra when pay by card
Bought a bag for 160 few meter same one on display for 300 Horrible customer service, no manners whatsoever by the female clerk think she was manager or owner. They charge extra for card payments too  what day and age do we live in for goodness sake! Would not recommend, avoid at ALL COSTS! Unfortunately, when I arrived at the hotel, I realized that they had deceived me by entering too many prices during cash register. They cheated me by 10 and I had paid 77 instead of 70. I have no complaints about product quality or salesperson behavior, but the make happen at checkout is disgraceful. Since there is no barcode system, you may fall into this game if you buy more than 34 items, be careful. Last word Why do you need this? Does the shop owner know about this?

Fishs Eddy,"889 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.5,40.7386847,-73.9900849,"Fishs Eddy is an unique store offers an everchanging assortment of highquality plates and kitchenware, making it a mustvisit for anyone looking for distinct and artistic pieces. The store is known for its unique art and designs, and the quality of their products is exceptional. Despite the high quality, the prices are surprisingly reasonable, making it a great place to find special items without breaking the bank. While it can get quite crowded on weekends, visiting during the week or in the evening allows for a more relaxed and enjoyable browsing experience. I had a blast browsing through Fishs Eddy! This place is a treasure trove of unique and quirky home goods and decor items  the kind of place that leaves you wanting to spend all day there. The names of items are funny, and they have an incredible selection of plates, cups, bowls and also have a section for pet posters.

Definetely recommend stopping here if in the flatiron area.

Wouldn't necessarily say this is kid friendly with all the narrow spaces to navigate through  and neither would it be wheelchair friendly. The store carries numerous exclusively amusing and unusually quirky kitchendish wares that are rare to find in NY, but theyre reasonably priced. By looking at them, some of Fishs Eddys items made me laugh. A fun place that had made my day and its totally worth a visit if you swing by the Flatiron district in Manhattan.  So happy to see this place thriving. I used to come here 27 years ago to buy platters. I still have and use the platters Ive bought.
A great place to find plates, cups, platters of all sizes! If you are looking for individual syrup containers  this is the place!
I didnt buy anything in my last visit  but I truly enjoyed just looking at everything in the store! My wife and I have been exporting stores in search of replacing our old dishes and while you might think there are lots of stores where you can go and pick them up and feel them, youd be mistaken. Of course you can find lots of dishes on the internet but  we wanted to lift them and even weigh them to make sure they would be right for us! I walked into Fishs Eddy on Broadway  near Union Square and Kalie was incredibly helpful! She helped me appreciate why Fishs Eddy is where well be buying our dishes!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Not only did he dig to the bottom of my handbag he used the metal wand to do a body scan! I wasn't allowed in because I had a small pepper spray in my bag. I went across the street to see if the holder were sold there.  No one stopped us at the door and the guard was very pleasant. I returned an hour later after I had someone hold my bag outside.  He kept asking me for my bag, I said I didn't have it, then he asked for my phone, I didn't have it.  He kept looking at my pants pockets and asking me what did I have in them. I was already irritated because I purposely walked in with JUST my credit card.  He needs to be addressed on how he treats customers entering your store. Too oversecured place. An unpleasant security check when entering does not invite you to go to the museum. They wanted to take away the drawing tools, but did not offer, for example, a cabinet for storage, etc. Everyone work here seems depressed. A staff carrying a cart glared at customers in her way in a gloomy look silently instead of communicating anything. The ladies at the checkout desk also only chatting with each other and didnt greet any customer at all as if they dont want any customer there at all.  The store sells merchandise related to the art displayed in the museum, such as 'Starry Night' by Van Gogh. The store is spacious and clean. The museum gift shop sells both a large selection of items related to exhibits on display Starry Nights, Campbell Soup Cans, etc as well as a large selection of completely unrelated goods.

Overall very large selection of goods, with only small sections of the shop dedicated to MoMA brandedrelated goods.

There's also a large area in the back with a large selection of books related to architecture and photography.","Monday: 10:30 AM – 6:30 PM

Our family from Durham, NC had a wonderful experience when they got a chance to experience Park Souvenirs  Gifts 1424 6th Ave, New York, NY 10019 I had a terrible experience at this store. When I was paying for some postcards that cost 1, I handed the cashier a 20 bill. However, he only gave me 14 in change. When I pointed out the mistake, he insisted that I had given him a 10 bill, which was a lie. After arguing with him, he finally admitted that he needed the 5 more than I did. This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable.
It was 14th of august about 1.45pm2pm. I would like to express my satisfaction while visiting the store... Everything was easy to locate.. The array of iconic products makes the experience even richer.. Plus, the customer service was impressive. I was approached by a young blond lady that promptly helped me with a big smile... The kind of smile that makes you feel comfortable and willing to spend more than just a few bucks. She was the whole package as a sales assistant. Thank u. Great store with many options, reasonable prices, and super cool owner. Glad we stopped in! Owner even gave us a discount  on an item we bought multiple of and gifted us a key chain on the way out! Nice shop! I was searching for a gift to buy and I was really bad treated by the sales person, I did not ask for his help, he basically was very incomodated with our presence in the store and started to complain. He's a small old man with a grey hair. He was putting me and my friend in a rush and he said that we were sleeping to decide what to buy, literally that, very rude and no sense. To buy gifts generally takes time and we were there for a few minutes only. I asked him if he was closing the store to try to understand his behavior and he said no. It sounds like he was watching me in the store and was incomodated with my presence. What he saw that was bothering him. My skin color? Tourist?

I Love NY By Phantom Of Broadway,"1607 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.2,40.7606177,-73.9847574,"Bought quite a few items 100 ish. Got a lovely big NY mug but after washing it once the transfers started peeling off. Shop staff really nice, lots of choice but question the quality. It wasnt a cheap mug either. The clerk was dishonest. The price was 19.56 I paid by cash and gave her 19 first. Then I show her my changes in my pocket and asked for her help to get 0.56. She first took two quarters and some coins, then she quickly grabbed some coins from my hand and dropped into the cashier box. This is my first time experiencing this kind of dishonest behavior in New York.

I strongly suggest NOT to shop in this store or you need to carefully count the money before any payment. One of the most interesting souvenir shops in New York City of Times Square in 42nd street
I love ny gifts is an excellent communicated store that employees help customers a lot in a difficult conversation and the customers get what they looking for very helpful and good service at the cashier spot I recommend the store so much for everyone
We give percent off or you can call discount  too  I bought a hat for my daughter. Next day she wore it in rain, blue color shed on white background. The same day we tried to exchange the hat, but the seller and her manager told that they are not responsible for what happened with the product outside, beside it they were extremely rude. Nice products... Just be careful with customer ""service""...

Hypothetical scenario If you pay with card there's a ""special fee"". If you pick a different size, ""extra fee"". If you look outside, probably they charge you another ""fee""... There are all sorts of added fees at checkout and the offers probably won't apply for what you choose.

But if you are aware that the customer is ""usually"" always wrong, then the experience might be average.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Not sure if this is the actual store, but be careful if the workers are Indian, they tend to want to scam you into higher, overpriced purchases when the price is actually less than what they charge you, and they usually cover up by not having price tags on the merchandise.

I love NY,"445 5th Ave, New York, NY 10016, USA",4,40.7516365,-73.981929,"People are kind. But prices are actually more expensive than in the airport. Each mug is 6.99 and then there is an offer for 20 for 3. If you bought it separately, it would cost 20.97. So not even a saving of a dollar. Airport is charging 2 for 12. So that's 6 perfectly.

I was immensely disappointed when I did the math after receiving a ""discount."" It didn't add up to much.

I would look elsewhere for your deals...I cannot recoomend this place. The people are kind but the offers are terrible... Many NYC souvenirs at great prices! Found gifts for family and friends, and a pretty tshirt for myself! Very nice shopkeeper! Stop by and check it out. NewYork is Best City in the world, for Christmas season all way Love  it.

It's a delightful store with lots of colors.  So much to look at in such a small space.
They have a great selection of chopsticks from just a couple dollars to expensive.  Some sets come in beautiful boxes for gifting.
They also have a few small ceramic tea service sets and fans and chopstick stands.  The chopstick stands were all different styles.  Some were cute animals and butterflies, and some were mother of pearl or abalone.  Also they have chopsticks for children that are attached at the top.
If you want several of the same, they have more in the drawers if you ask. The salesperson was very nice. Great store, like a chopstick museum, I always come here when I have a chance. You can buy beautiful chopsticks from 5 to 500. Handpainted and carved chopsticks, silver chopsticks, so much selection. Also, great chopsticks for kids too. I noticed recently, theyve started to sell handpainted silk fans and beaded bracelets. All great quality! One of the best stores in Chinatown. Love this place. Beautiful and cute chopsticks . Some cheap, some expensive. Bought a hairpin as well. Staff is friendly. Be aware there is a charge to use ur card. I had an urge to pick up some nice chopsticks since I want to eat food in a traditional japanese fashion so I went to Yunhong on the advice of someone. I like the store it had a large assortment of chopsticks from 520 and more plastic and metal and wood as well. They had chopstick holders too I never knew there was such a thing go figure. I picked up a nice looking set of 4 chopsticks for 8 and I was very happy with the look and the price of the chopsticks.

Glad we stopped in and picked up some now and then items. Definitely worth a visit. wall to wall, floor to ceiling CANDY!!!! its kinda like a Willy Wonka feeling. you can eat everything in there  the smell is scrumptious 
we found parking right out front,  went in for our candy haul!!!! our bag was filed to the top! how could we not?! the candy selection was beyond satisfying. if youre in the east side area, 108 rivington st. to be exact GOOOO INNNN! youll thank me a ton of calories later  Economy Candy is a true gem in New York City, serving as the oldest retail candy shop in the Big Apple. As soon as you step inside, you're surrounded by candy in every direction, filling the air with a sweet aroma. The shelves are adorned with nostalgic knickknacks, offering a glimpse into the past and adding to the shop's charming ambiance. Established in 1937, Economy Candy has been delighting customers with its wide selection of candies from not only the United States but also from around the world.

Visiting Economy Candy is an experience in itself, with so much to see and tempt your taste buds. However, be prepared to exercise some serious selfcontrol, as it's nearly impossible to leave without making a purchase.

While the overall experience at Economy Candy is delightful, there was a slight disappointment regarding pricing accuracy. Some prices didn't match what was indicated, and unfortunately, there was no flexibility at the checkout regarding the prices listed on the items I am not referring to the tax which is added at checkout. This left a sour taste in our mouths, especially when the discrepancy caused some unexpected budget constraints for the children. Despite this minor hiccup, the staff were friendly and helpful when we had questions.

Overall, Economy Candy is a mustvisit destination for candy lovers in New York City, offering a delightful array of treats and a charming atmosphere that will leave you with sweet memories. incredible large collection of candy from all over the world. if you are looking for something special as a gift or to treat yourself just go there! from Korea to German candy you can find everything there. also the place is quite unique with its looks and the old signs etc. oldest candystore in NYC! I found out about this place through a FB reel that popped up on my feed. Had to check it out.

Surrounding area  Located in lower Manhattan. Parking is a challenge. The one perk is that it's very close to Katz. Who wouldn't  love a GREAT pastrami sandwich, hahaha?

Store The store is a true candy heaven. Upon walking in, you are transformed into a Willy Wonka candy world!!!  I saw candy that took me back to my childhood years.  They have EVERY type of candy you can imagine. The physical aspect of the store definitely needs an upgrade. It is not accessible to all.  Wheelchairs and walkers  wouldn't be able to maneuver around the tight aisles. The aisles are cramped, and walking freely is a challenge. If someone is in the aisle already, there is no space to get by.

The shopping bags are really cute  costs 1.00

Customer Service  Upon checking out, the gentleman that rang me up was either mad to be there, just over everything, or wanted to go home. For working in a candy store, the disposition was definitely off.

I'm not sure I would return.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Jung Lee NY,"25 W 29th St, New York, NY 10001, USA",4,40.745982,-73.988086,"Really helpful in getting a specific item for a birthday gift. The order took awhile to arrive the items were coming from Italy so totally expected it but they kept me informed the whole time and my items shipped in perfect condition. I would recommend! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! I placed an order  2 weeks ago and it said it would be delivered in 57 days. This was a gift for a shower I was attending.
I tried contacting customer service twice to inquire about shipping date and still have not heard back from them.
The party is over, I had to purchase a different gift so now I am trying to get a refund.
I imagine I will have the same communication issues again. Worst experience ever! I love home appliances stores, and I was waiting for my husband close to Junglee, so I thought to take a look while waiting. When my husband arrived and I was about to leave, an old lady she is supposed to be the manager at the store commented rudely saying ""is that what you are here about, waiting for someone!"" When I confronted her, she lied about it and said that I was talking to my colleague!!
Although she was looking at me when she was talking. I would never visit the store again! So. This is difficult for me because truly they have a great selection of objects. But I gotta warn people. Unless they have something in stock to buy right there. Do not purchase. I work in the design industry and understand that vendors dont always cooperate with timelines. Covid has also made things harder. But honestly the way they manage this from a customer service standpoint alone is very bad.
If I were to specify something from their store at this point I could not trust Junglee to come through and to top it off The apathy demonstrated is pretty astronomical. Im still waiting for a part of my order that has been outstanding for 5 months at this point and I had to cancel another order because it didnt make sense to keep waiting for it again 5 months.
Not telling you to not shop there, but just know that when they offer to order something for you you are agreeing to some very vague terms and the staff really cant be bothered to keep you informed. Im sad that I wont be using them as a resource anymore but they arent trustworthy. friendly and informative staff ready to help you as soon as you walk in the door.

There's a mantle piece with framed photos of cast members that have passed away, which I found particularly moving.  All the displays were fantastic. Its a great place to visit in New York. It has a wide selection of souvenirs and exclusive official merchandise from the store, meaning you wont find it in any park.

There is a special section for Butterbeer and themed sweets.

Downstairs, there is an area dedicated exclusively to different versions of the books and the art design of the entire franchise. It's a great HP shop experience on 2 levels. Awesome coffee!  Found it by accident when visiting the Friends experience and flat iron building, Gramercy Park is around the corner so make it a morning sightseeing. Your welcome.  Nothing much else to add that hasn't already been said.

If you love HP like most millennials and my daughters do, this is an amazing store. Got butter beer soft serve and a hedwig  pram suit for my future baby. Fantastic decor and it was cool to see adults so happy to relive their childhood.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Greenwich Letterpress,"15 Christopher St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.7,40.7340613,-74.0005639,"I stumbled upon this place while exploring the area and decided to check it out. The window decorations caught my eye, so I went inside. They have a great selection of unique birthday cards, wrapping paper, diaries, and other stationery items, all organized by theme. It was fun to browse through everything!

I didnt buy anything since I didnt have an immediate need, but Ill definitely consider coming back in the future. Thanks for the warm welcome! Really cute store! Great prices on the stickers, I got two of the smaller individual sheets and they were only 3. Theres a 5 card minimum. There are a lot of cards here for every occasions, and some smaller items like notebooks too. A good selection of different color pens but I wish they had some washi tape too. I love stationary stores, and this one is a new favorite. It's so great and weird. Their card selection is insane a great range of classy crowd pleasers to wonderfully odd. They have a great supply of things everything from a tinned fish candle to some tiny wizard stickers. If you're looking for a place to get a friend a gift, a card for any occasion, or just something nice and cute and funny for yourself, take yourself to this wonderful shop. It'll put a smile on your face. Wonderful little shop. Incredibly decorated  so cute. Great place to pop in for a gift for someone or some cute knick knacks. Prices were a tad high, but expected when going into a shop where most things are made by smaller artists.

Does not seem wheelchair accessible as there are about 5 or 6 steps up to get into the shop.

Overall would recommend! Cute to even just stop in and browse. I didn't know I needed the perfect 2023 Christmas cards, but somehow Greenwich Letterpress did! The store is chockfull of notebooks, Le Pens!, gifts and the best stationary and desk gear. I also bought a French turtle tape dispenser at this delightful store. You'll find something for everyone at this NYC gem  shop there today!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

The LEGO® Store Fifth Avenue,"636 5th Ave, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.6,40.7591338,-73.9771693,"Its certainly meant to draw tourists in in what is a very tourist heavy part of town and it does its job well. Lego stores are always fun to visit and this is no exception.

The inside is full of large scale builds of things like cityscapes, large scale minifigs and more. What was really cool for me to see is that some of the builds from Lego Masters were even featured in this store. Its really cool to see builds from TV in person.

One of the things people seemed to love was the create your own minifig station setup. There were lots of people creating their own custom minifig. In addition to that it seemed like the staff were also doing some live demos of sets at stations setup within the store.

This was a really cool store to visit. I didn't buy anything this time but I had a blast checking out all the cool stuff packed within.

As a heads up this is a twostory store. If you are mobility challenged there is an elevator that will take you between both levels. If you can handle stairs they are worth taking once if only to see all the cool builds up the stairwell. Of all the Lego stores I have been to, this was by far the COOLEST experience!! This place was awesome! We went here mostly to see the Lego Masters Finale winners build which was so freaking awesome! We were not let down! This place displays some of the coolest builds I have ever seen! Including a whole staircase full on your way to the second level! Best Lego store in town!!! Skip the other Lego stores.

We designed our own mini figures. The only downside was that there werent enough variety in pants type andor accessory type to suit the ones that we designed so we settled on a couple of things. Overall a great experience though. The LEGO Store on 5th Avenue in New York City is a mustvisit destination for LEGO enthusiasts of all ages. Located in the heart of Manhattan, this flagship store is an impressive blend of creativity, fun, and retail excitement. The first thing you notice upon entering is the incredible LEGO displays, including largescale models of iconic NYC landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building, all crafted from thousands of LEGO bricks. One of the coolest Lego stores I've ever been to. It had a lot of fun decor and the employees were very friendly. One even helped me make a mosaic of myself didn't buy it tho. There's also a LEGO brick made of a meteorite which is pretty epic.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Disney Store,"1540 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.5,40.7582524,-73.9850513,"The Disney Store in Times Square is a magical experience for fans of all ages! The store is beautifully designed, featuring stunning displays of beloved characters and immersive themed sections. Theres a fantastic selection of merchandise, from plush toys to apparel and collectibles. The atmosphere is lively, and the Cast Members are friendly and helpful. Dont miss the enchanting staircase and the giant Disney character sculptures they make for great photo opportunities! A mustvisit for Disney lovers and a fun stop for anyone exploring Times Square Oh to feel like a kid again! Maybe Im too biased to leave a review here, but all these smallest details, all these characters, so many cute and nostalgic characters I loved the store and bought many things here. One can spend hours and hours here, so much to see and so much to enjoy  magic was definitely in the air Terrible experience if going for limited items, waited on line for 4 hours, managers allowed and assisted line cutters, and anyone behind them ended up with nothing.

There was 0 compassion or empathy from a handful of the staff.

Less than 170 that were on the actual line got the d23 set. I was 193rd on line and there was probably another 200 behind me. What a terrible experience. Why even bother advertising with less than 200 stock. Every other place had much more.

Could have said the first 200 will get one instead of making potentially 300 people wait for hours and for nothing.

Again such a bad experience to go through with Disney and leaves a bad taste in your mouth We love this Disney Store located in Times Square, New York! The moment you stepped into this large and elegant store, it felt like you have been transported to an enchanting and magical world of Disney! We visited during Christmas and we love the wonderful atmosphere with all the gifts and toys displayed neatly on the shelves. Adults and kids alike were walking around choosing their favourite toys. Love the beautiful and magnificent castle inside the store, with its big chandelier! Truly a fun experience for the young and old. Its so amazing to watch the Disney store and reminisce on childhood memories. They have a great collection of toys snd swaggers from all the Disney movies from all times. Some of the characters I didnt recognize because theyre Gen Z TV shows that I havent watched lol.

Its a perfect place to buy souvenirs from, but you definitely need to watch it cause you can easily get carried away and spend hundreds of dollars in the store.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Me and my family visited recently and were in wow over all the excitement that was going on inside the store. The customer service was excellent! Such a fun place! We will definitely return! FAO Schwarz is a fantastic place to visit, especially if you're a fan of toys! I initially went there for dinner with Jellycat, but I quickly realized its one of the best toy shops Ive ever been to. The team members are incredibly playful and engaging, which makes the experience even more enjoyable. If you have children, they will absolutely love it here, and be prepared to spend a good amount of moneythere are just so many amazing options! It's such a fun place with a vibrant atmosphere, making it well worth the visit. One day in June my little family I visited your FAO Schwarz together as a family for the first time and truly had such a special family moment. From playing astronaut in the space shuttle upstairs to choosing candy with his daddy, to building a bear downstairs, we all had an incredibly happy time! We were there celebrating the end of my husbands chemo treatments and the whole atmosphere of the store was such a calm and happy vibe. Thank you for sprinkling in a bit of magic into our lives during such a difficult time for my son and for creating a space where we could all relax and escape for a few minutes!

Sincerely a very happy customer,

Catherine I wish I was a child again
I wish I had had such a store when I was a child 
Recreated the Big scene at the piano.
You can go there and play, maybe have to stand in line but not long.
The staff is so professional and lovely.
And the abundance of toys is wooow We came to the store for an event with BLUEY it was an amazing experience for my grand daughter. It was super crowded, she stepped in the famous Big piano which she enjoyed it. A magical place for all ages to enjoy. Highly recommend.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

They were both rude and proceeded talking about their life and how bad some of their workers are when I asked them for help

I come back a few days ago and asked a simple question and was given attitude by the same woman, although one of the other workers did assist me and did a good job, I would recommend tourist spend there money elsewhere Loved this place. Lots of unique Yankees apparel. The staff was awesome! Helpful and professional. Pricing wasn't too bad. Very small selection, cheaper to buy online, no big and tall. Excelent.

It is now 42223 and have not received anything.  I have sent multiple emails  and even chatted with someone on Messenger.   They were supposed to check into this 5 days ago.  Have heard nothing since then.  I did receive. 12.00 credit but was charged 91.50.  No customer service at all.  Crickets!!! I would like my pins that I ordered, but at this point in time I just want a refund.  I will never deal  with this company again.  I will spread the word as well.  My order number is 4932.  People run dont walk away from this company.   Update on this post.   I received part of my order 1 week ago.  I am still waiting for  1 more thing but I am not holding my breath.   I still would not order anything from this company.  No customer service  at all.    Hope this helps people who are looking at this company.   Additional update. I heard from the owner of this business today 61423.  The owner stated that the problem was with a 3 rd party vendor.  I do believe that , but communication from the owner would have been appreciated.  I received a discount on a future purchase valid for 30 days.  I still wont purchase anything else from this business based on my experience. You dont  get a second  chance to make a first impression.  This is my opinion. My son's best friend bought a picture here that was supposed to signed by two broadway actors, from his favor musical. He and his mother even asked if it was real and was assured by the merchant it was. Low and behold...it was not real and this poor kid was devastated. Not to mention out the money he paid for said picture. Which was a lot for a teenager To lie to a kid and his other is absolute absurd and uncalled for! Do not buy from this scam of a place. I stumbled into Broadway Makers Marketplace and I'm glad that I did! The owner also sells tickets to shows which are good prices and great seats. I was so happy with the first experience that I went to another show, and that was great too. I look forward to seeing many shows in the future with the help of Michael at Broadway Makers Marketplace.

Thanks!!! Unfortunately I have to leave a 1 star review because I ordered my Six playbill ornament on Nov 29th and it is now Dec 20th and the ornament hasn't even left NYC. The customer service has been nonexistent. I have messaged the shop 5 times on Shopify, reached out directly through contact us message on the website, and tried calling the store 3 different times. I haven't heard back at all, not I have I received a refund for my ornament. This is very disappointing. Do better Broadway Makers Market. For the record, my order number was 4421. NEVER order from here.  I placed an order back in December.  Still have not received.  I've emailed, tried to call mailbox always full, tried online chatting, no one ever answers.  It's a scam...BEWARE.

 Update  merchant finally reached out and ultimately refunded my money.  I cannot review the product as I never received because I opted for the refund.  I've updated my rating as merchant did right by offering me my money back.",no operation time,"point_of_interest, store, establishment"
Urban Outfitters,"521 5th Ave, New York, NY 10175, USA",4.1,40.7541314,-73.9798826,"Did not find anything that appealed to me. Disappointed in options, styles, variety. The staff in the dressing room lost my items while I was fitting clothes. No apologies.  It was confusing. Not my ideal store Id have to agree emphatically with others, the employees are rude.

This is the most convenient uo for me and i try to buy online, but i do my returns hereugh.

The security guard is the nicest guy in there. Every time i come through the door he says hello and exiting too.

Who does the hiring? Because they need to reassess the importance of a positive customer service experience. As customers were not expecting a lot, we understand its not easy to find motivated employees with a strong work ethic. The brand may suffer as employees are a big part of the shopping experience. The product mix is important, but given attitude when trying to find an item or a size is unacceptable. Please do better. I love Urban and have been a loyal customer for years. I have visited many Urban locations around the world, but this was by far the worst one. Not only was the inventory disappointing, but the employees were also extremely rude. I did not feel welcomed at all and felt uneasy when I left.

The cashier who checked me out was very curt and was racist towards me as a black woman. Her reference number is 303539. For a store located on a major avenue in New York City, I expected much better. Useless workers, bad customer service , they said they had a certain item in stock, I went over 20 miles because they said they had this certain item in stock. I got there to ask if they have the item and the guy with braids went ahead and helped someone else then they blasted music really loud as I started to get annoyed. No one was any help.

He helped me gather some sweet treats for my mothers birthday and she loved themmmm  I was quite disappointed as this place was hard to find. Just a heads up that it's inside of the Rockefeller center, in the lower level. I also Googled ""candy store"" and this is the first place that popped up so I expected it to have a wide array of candy. After finally getting to the right place, I saw through the glass that they only had a select variety of sweets such as a few baked treats, macarons and custom lollipops, not even candy. The greatest bummer was that they were closed I've added the sign found on their door, although listen as open on Google. I urge this business to keep their hours updated on Google so people are aware and don't waste trips. I gave it a neutral rating because I never got to actually try their goods. Yet I will say this place doesn't really have what I'm interested in, so I don't plan on going back to try anything. Komla was SO helpful. I called ahead to put my order together and he was great to work with in person as well. I can't say enough good things. A customer service. Thank you!
And of course, the fancy candy was a hit at the party. The cold brew bears really have some kick to them! I was there last summer with my sister and her kids and my brother's daughter. The place is a kid's dream come true when it comes to candies. Love the chocolate we got there The store has the best candy. The manager Ebony was amazing as well.

Thank you so much  Unique selection for photographers and well made stylish products yet very functional. Great customer service. They offer military discount and its very much appreciated. What a delight. I came in knowing of Peak Designs reputation for meticulously well designed products. And their servicesales experience was equally well executed. Tahiti was so extremely helpful there was no pressure to upset or to buy but rather to make sure I walked out with the bag I needed to solve my daily problems of carrying X, Y, and Z. Well done Peak Design well done! Stopped after a spontaneous shoot in SoHo had no expectations and was greeted and helped by Kiara. I had a phenomenal experience, Kiara helped me with a warranty exchange for my shoulder strap, provided me some new anchor connectors, and helped me purchase the clutch camera hand strap as well. She was a great help, great conversation, very knowledgeable, and very welcoming. One of my best shopping experiences ever. Thank you to Kiara for a great experience, and thank you Peak Design for the great gear, and shop. I am glad I decided to visit the Peak Design official store in New York. It was a last minute decision for me.

I have been a big fan of Peak Design brands since I started exploring digital photography. It has been a couple years now. I just love the company and I am impressed with their highquality, welldesigned and functional products ranging from camera bags, cameras and mobile accessories etc. Overall I really enjoyed my experience at their store.

The store is situated in SoHo area. The shop itself is well organised and pleasant to walk around. The products are placed on the shelf nicely. The store design is minimal and I got an impression of the Apple store vibe.

Chris who is a store manager on that day was very helpful. I purchased a couple of items from the shop. I really like their products!!!

Originally, I was here just to return a pair that was too big but Sasha who was helping me changed my mind due to how great of an experience I had here. I ended up leaving with this cute pair after trying on many different pairs and sizes! I didn't purchase anything from this store. It was a pick up from an online order that wouldn't deliver to my home. The store looked clean and spacious and a security guard was present. The gentleman who took care of me was polite and courteous. If I ever make an in person store purchase or even have to pick my order up again, I would come to this location. I went to the store for my new pair of winter shoes. The staff was extremely nice to me. She help me to get the boots which match with my requirement. Unfortunately that I forgot her name but she is the one with beautiful curly hair.
The shoes is nice and warm as always.
By the way, they got two cashiers spot, one on the ground floor and another on the second floor. If you don't like the long queue I highly recommend the ground floor. Bright and inviting store. I love the coziness of UGG. Was very excited to find new slippers and a pair of lounge pants on my first visit here. Lennon and Leina were excellent, very friendly, and provided great customer service!!! The staff at this store doesnt have enough to do. I was told to go downstairs to pay so proceeded down the escalator to the front of the store as directed to the register. I was chased through the store by the overzealous manager, overheard her message to the security guard at the front of the store to lock down the door and stop me. I was walking with my 5 year old at a 5 year old pace which is more of a meandering to the register with my credit card in my hand. This manager needs to be properly trained and given real work to do so she stops harassing paying customers.

Dont buy from here. Go anywhere else. I am in touch with press and you shouldnt waste your time buying from here. I will be returning my purchase and will never buy anything from Ugg again.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

With its thoughtful exhibitions, knowledgeable staff, and welcoming atmosphere, it's a mustvisit destination for anyone interested in Jewish history and culture. Five stars without a doubt! We didn't feel comfortable. It's like we were the odd ones if you know what I mean. My daughter is always interested in knowing about different cultures and religions but it's not always so welcoming. And I checked in my jacket and when I was ready to go it was toss to the side on a rail. The person had no other excuse but to say that it fell on the floor and instead of hanging it back up on hanger 97. She tossed it to the side with plenty of coat hangers. It's wasn't packed. I am not interested in going back there again. But I'm glad my daughter still got to explore and read about the different art. Just sad how we still live in a world where even though we bleed the same color we are STILL not comfortable with one another. Thanks anyways. It was free so at least I'm not that disappointed. I digress.  I love his museum. Always something new and intetesting! Went to see Gaby Aghion  Chloe exhibit. We took a tourpublic tour at no cost offered by Museum. It was very intetesting and informative and provided an intetesting view on the whole concept of Chloe. And of course a stunning collection of clothes by different designers who worked for Chloe.
Also went through the other parts of museum. Saw lots of new art objects. The permanent collection rotating every few month so that visitors are able to see as many onjects as possible. And the museum store is like a continuation of museum. I went today and did the 1 hour tour, which was excellent.  The docent really knew her material and loved her Jewish history. On my own, i toured the museum, which had a nice arrangement of artwork and artists. I was happy to go to this beautiful place as a Christian and learn some new things. I visted for Mood of the moment Gaby Aghion and the house of Chlo. The exhibition itself is well collected of the history pieces from each designer period with the story of each designer in that timing. Another floor also has others exhibition as well for 3 floor in general.

Barnes & Noble,"555 5th Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.5,40.7557334,-73.9789175,"I like the place. A little busy but it's because it has a lot. Plus, it is one of the last Barnes  Noble that is still open. I also like that it has a Starbucks inside the snacks are so much better than the actual Starbucks. The staff were all friendly and helpful, from the security personnel,  the information desk, cashiers I was impressed. It was also my first time visiting the store from Vancouver Canada so first and last impression was great! They had so many great books to choose from. My favourite section was the Social sciences, True crime and Biography. Good selection here and some gift items.  They have a music section now too.  The Starbucks inside is nice to take a break in and there is a bathroom.  You need to buy something to get the code but I'm fine with that.
It's not their flagship site but this is so a good store. This Barnes and Noble truly excels in cleanliness and organization. From the moment you step inside, you can't help but notice the pristine shelves, neatly arranged displays, and the overall tidiness that makes browsing a joy. The attention to detail in maintaining such a wellorganized space is truly commendable.

Moreover, the service at Barnes and Noble is exceptional. The staff members are always friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to assist you in finding the perfect book or offering recommendations. Their dedication to providing a positive shopping experience shines through in their helpful demeanor and willingness to go above and beyond for customers.

Overall, Barnes and Noble's commitment to cleanliness, organization, and excellent service truly sets them apart as a standout bookstore. It's the kind of place where you can easily lose track of time exploring the vast selection of books while enjoying the welcoming atmosphere. I loved the friends experience. It was super nice. I recommend it.

Jangmi,"44 W 47th St GF16, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.8,40.757433,-73.980663,"Long overdue review but my nowhusband bought my engagement ring from Jangmi last year. Ive gotten so many compliments from friends, family, coworkers and even strangers on my ring. We were so impressed with the ring that we even bought our wedding bands from them. The quality of their rings are impeccable and the staffs commitment to finding our perfect rings are commendable. They were able to work with our budget and explained the differences in sizes, colors, clarity, cuts, settings, and more in detail. They also offered to clean our rings each time and we left feeling like . They went above and beyond in providing us with the best service and the best rings. Lya was especially helpful on multiple occasions when we were there. Highly recommend anyone who is looking for engagement ringswedding bands to check out Jangmi! This is a long overdue review! My husband and I have been coming to here since before we officially got engaged. I first stopped at Jangmi with my best friend to figure out what I wanted for my engagement ring. Jangmi was one of four stores I had appointments at, and it was the only place that I felt valued us stopping in. I got the sense that most sales reps dont take women who dont come in with their significant other very seriously and felt brushed off by the employees at the other stores well reviewed and all throughout the city. I wish I could remember who helped me that first visit, but he was really warm, informative, and not at all pushy. I sent my now husband to have my engagement ring done there, along with a list of wants for the ring. He worked with Mrs. Kim to design the engagement ring I wanted. We both had such good experiences there that we knew wed go back when it was time for our wedding.

Since my engagement ring, my husband and I have unofficially made Jangmi our diamondfine jewelry spot. It started when we went back for our wedding bands. I ended up buying James two different bands. He wanted a simple band, but then spotted a ring that not only suited him really well but also fit him perfectly. We felt like Mrs. Kim was kind, informative, and not at all pushy during this time, so we asked for pricing on other pieces as we still needed earrings and necklaces for the wedding. Weve since gone back for some other pieces after our wedding. Everything weve purchased yes, we have a lot of Jangmi pieces now lol prioritizes combining structural integrity with aesthetics.

Mrs. Kim will let you know if she thinks something wont work well and gives other helpful suggestions, and, no, I dont mean more expensive options. Mrs. Kim has always tried to show me what I ask for and also make her own suggestions. I havent been led wrong yet! Shes picked out pieces for me that I wouldnt have chosen for myself that end up looking great, but has never once pushed me to purchase anything. Both Mrs. and Mr. Kim are just really passionate about their jewelry, and you can tell they love to share that with anyone who is interested.

My husband and I cant seem to leave Jangmi without extra pieces even when we are just there to get something serviced or pick up one thing because of the excellent variety in styles and, of course, how gracious the Kims are. Obviously, I cant say enough good things, but Ill stop here and just leave some photos. My husbands studs and my two necklaces in the wedding photos are all from Jangmi, and you can see how they pop even from further away. So grateful to have found Jangmi through super positive reviews from Reddit  Google  insta. Im so so so happy with my ring and am so grateful to Mr and Mrs Kim. Mrs Kim knows exactly what to suggest to elevate every design, has such an excellent grasp of all things diamonds and I just loved seeing them every time  Ill have to visit frequently because theyre such a delight. Theyre both so nice!! You can really trust them  you really need to go to Jangmi for engagementwedding rings. I plan on going to them for anything diamond related in the future  thank you so much Mr  Mrs Kim for making this experience so special! I LOVE my rings!

The staff was wonderful and made sure to give us their undivided attention while we picked out the rings we wanted. They even offer free services if there is anything you need done to make sure it's exactly what you want.

We needed the rings VERY quickly and they were able to get them done in time for our trip!

Thank you so much for such beautiful rings and excellent customer service! Thank you so much Lya and the owners for helping me selecting this wonderful diamond  proposal ring. The ring came out much better than I imagined and my gf now finance absolutely loves it! Great service and very thorough in explaining various options. They were very patient in answering all my questions and highly responsive whenever I reached out. I would highly recommend this place over any other places in the diamond district!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM

See's Candies,"60 W 8th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,40.7333296,-73.9991583,"Great staff  friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable! This is the only See's Candies store on the East Coast, with product flown in weekly from Los Angeles to ensure freshness! This store feels like a classic oldfashioned candy shop with checkerboard flooring and an elegant presentation of candy and truffles in display cases  a huge variety. My favorites are the Peppermint Krispies, Dark Molasses Chips, Dark Nougat, and Raspberry Truffles  so delicious! This place is legendary.

Growing up in California, every mall had a Sees Candies store  Its a California tradition with a very loyal customer base and a history that goes back generations. This definitely takes me back to the best of my childhood. There are very few of these stores on the East Coast and I do appreciate how rare and special it is to have this store here. See's Candies is a wonderful place to visit. The decor takes you back to a special time that is warm, magical and full of cherished family memories.
The chocolate is amazing!! So fresh and delicious, with so many flavors to choose from. Great for gifts, and great to treat yourself! I love it!!
The staff were very pleasant, the manager is kind and informative, they know their candy.
This is also the only See's on the East coast.
I got a 1 pound box of chocolates, I let the team know what kind of flavors myself and my husband typically like, and they built a box with great suggestions in mind.
My favorite is strawberry cream, everything was so good.
Thank you, I will be back! A friend loves Sees, so tend to pop in to buy him a box when I'm in the area. Cute little place, with nice ambience on entering  despite the small size.

Chocolates are good but wildly expensive. They only very rarely seem to have the Mixed Milk box, the one I actually want, but will make up a custom box if you ask. Not as good for travel, however, and works out more expensive.

Service is hit and miss. It's always been either quiet and deserted when I've gone in and still can't predict. One guy with kind of auburn curly hair has been there a few times and may be a manager? He's great and makes you feel like an actual person, not an inconvenience. Others can be nice or disinterested.

A peculiarity that drives me crazy is their insistence on saying ""you don't want a bag, do you?"" and ""you don't want a receipt, do you?"". Apparently the franchise owners demand it and it rankles. Maybe I DO want a bag andor receipt? Minor thing, but it comes across as a bit paternalistic, patronising and miserly. Such a bizarre approach to customer service. I just spent over 100 on chocolate, so I'd prefer you didn't become dismissive as I hand over the money. This place is more expensive than the web site and other shops in the West.
Also, you cannot use gift cards at this shop.

Staff told me that its more expensive because its in NYC. Lol..

Just to give you an example, the toffee ettes 1 lb can is 33 at this shop but the rest is 29.

Staffs were friendly and nice. They were patience to answer all my questions. They wrapped my chocolate boxes nice.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

I wandered in here on accident and Yaf truly gave me a wonderful experience. She has great energy and if her merchandise wasnt enough to get you back in and believe me, it is then she will win you over. She wrapped up my purchase so sweetly for me because it was my birthday. In the picture is the amazing ring I got from her, which is even more beautiful in person. I get endless compliments on it. Highly recommend this place! I HIGHLY recommend Yaf Sparkle! I've ordered MANY of the John Varvatos pieces from this awesome boutique. This very masculine and edgy jewelry speaks to me. And the service provided by Sara is second to none. She's AMAZING, kind, and actually follows up. Give this boutique a try. I LOVE it!
Doug We happened upon this place while waiting for a nearby tour.  What a gem of a boutique.  This shop carries top quality gold, fine jewelry and semi precious stone settings.  Yaf is absolutely a delight.  She made me feel so welcome and though a lot of the jewelry was out of my price range, she found just the perfect pair of earrings for me that I could afford.  Don't miss this place for unique pieces that you will not find elsewhere! What a great boutique!  Their jewelry is unique, beautiful and creative  fits all different styles.  The products are of great quality and they offer a huge variety  and are reasonably priced.   The people that work there are so incredibly kind, helpful and stylish!  I highly recommend One of the Lower East Side's best kept secrets! A treasure trove of beautiful jewelry in many different styles and price points. If you have the chance to meet Yaf herself, you are in for a treat  her warm, welcoming smile will greet you and she'll make you feel like a VIP Love this local business. I advised my friend who was going on a business trip to the Middle East to buy all his client gifts here. He took them over there and got rave reviews from the men and the women. They said that the girls ""went bananas"" when they received their bracelets and necklaces! He was really happy to receive a personalized service where he had a consultation at the store that covered each person on his list to match them with a gift they'd absolutely love.
