Maison le Bac Paris Apartments,"26 Rue Poissonnière, 75002 Paris, France",4.5,48.8696685,2.348008000000001,"This was the perfect accommodation for my first trip to Paris. The location suited all of my needs, and was very ideal and picturesque. The room has everything you need, even laundry and a full kitchen! The bed is comfy, and the large windows are beautiful. The only thing I would consider for some people is that there seems to be an elementary school with very vocal children all day long, which is disruptive if youre looking for quiet. Overall, I loved this apartment and will recommend it to everyone. Unforgettable stay.. Maison Le Bac made my Paris trip memorable. Location is wonderful lots of attractions nearby. Lots of bars nearby. Service was nice. We felt like home... My studio apartment was well managed. I had the most amazing stay at this flat in Paris! The location was perfect, close to all the major attractions and with easy access to public transportation. The flat itself was beautifully decorated and had all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The host was also extremely friendly and helpful, providing great recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a cozy and convenient place to stay in Paris. I can't wait to come back and stay here again! Nice place to stay. Large room with good bed and clean bathroom. This part of city is good and safe to stay. Super close to the center of Paris. Friendly and helpful staffs. Nice appartment hotel to stay. Excellent service will neat and clean bedroom. Good view and best location to stay as it is in the center of Paris. Easy excess to everything.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Hôtel d'Orsay,"93 Rue de Lille, 75007 Paris, France",4.7,48.86038899999999,2.323112,"Wonderful little hotel in an ideal location.

We spent 3 night of our Honeymoon here and could not have been more pleased.

The rooms themselves are small as to be expected in Paris but they are clean and well maintained.

The bathrooms are fine except for that weird half shower door thing most hotels around the world are doing now.

The location is prime. Steps from the Musee dOrsay and walking distance from everything you would want to see in Paris.

Close to some amazing restaurants and the metro and bikes to ride around the city.

But the best thing about this hotel was the staff. So amazingly helpful, so polite and very patient with us slow Americans. I cant recall the gentleman who ran the desk at nights name but he was supremely kind and friendly and always greeted us with a smile.

All in all a great stay in Paris and we will return. Quiet, beautiful hotel in an upscale neighborhood. There was little to no traffic or noise at all, you are steps away from the Museum and Metro, and the staff went above and beyond to make our special trip memorable.  Truly a 4 star experience if not more.  Breakfast buffet was also fantastic see photos  fresh squeezed juiceteacoffee, great breads, proteins, fresh fruits, all higher end.  We will be back. The Hotel d'Orsay was the perfect place to stay with our group of eleven for my mother's 80th birthday trip to Paris!  The location is perfect and the hotel is lovely.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  The lobby and breakfast room are pretty and elegant.  The breakfast spread was delicious.  All of the staff were welcoming and kind and so helpful!!  Didn't want to leave. We just spent a wonderful week at Htel DOrsay  a lovely hotel in a great, central location in Paris on the left bank. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. Best of all is the delightful staff who are all very welcoming and extremely helpful! We enjoyed the delicious breakfast which was enhanced by the service from the wonderful staff. We highly recommend staying at Hotel DOrsay and look forward to returning for a future stay! We stayed at the hotel the beginning of May and it was wonderful. Everything from checkin, accommodations, breakfast were perfect. Beautiful hotel in a wonderful part of Paris. The staff were fantastic. The room was very nice and spacious. Next time we will return, we will stay there for sure. Wonderful","Monday: Open 24 hours

Lovely courtyard for an evening drink and snack. V helpful and friendly staff. The hotel is so much nicer than an impersonal chain and totally complements the experience of this beautiful city. We had a wonderful day at Hotel Henriette. Everything was perfect! We also really loved the neighborhood and the gourmet restaurants nearby. For my mother, it was extremely convenient, because there are so many buses and also the metro station right there. I will definitely be back! We stayed 3 nights.  A small, very nice hotel that was very good value.  A little off the beaten track but right next to a metro stop so easy to get anywhere in the city quickly.  Rooms are small but pleasant, bath is modern and well appointed.  Staff was very pleasant and very helpful Best service ! Cute rooms with a great view. They went out of their way with fixing flowers and balloons for a birthday we had, thanks! And thanks to all working there making this a Hotel you never forget. I highly recommend this lovely hotel not just for the amazing facilities but also the Fantastic services offered by the staff. They make you feel comfortable at all times. The beds are very comfy and the stay is quiet and pleasant. The decoration of the main common areas are beautiful without being overwhelming. The ice of the cake was the staff kindness to help me deal with a courier situation without any complain whatsoever. The location offered quiet and nice sorrounding with many shops and restaurants. It's easy to move around the city as it has a very close metro line stop. I will be very happy to return.","Monday: Open 24 hours

HÔTEL RACHEL,"1 Rue du Capitaine Soyer, 93310 Le Pré-Saint-Gervais, France",3.2,48.882678,2.403689399999999,"Room was dirty, with nothing other than bed in it. Bed was tainted and curtain was broken. Service was terrible as well. No additional towels were properly provided I stayed several nights and they refused to give me very simple things that I asked. Location wise, it is nowhere near the city center. I have stayed at a single room with a private bathroom for a weekend trip to Paris. First time in the city, and the experience was amazing. The staff was friendly, the room was great, and the neighborhood was very lovely. I checked the room and the bed for cleanliness right after my arrival as you should in all hotels, and everything was spotless. I really do not understand the negative reviews. Perhaps people's expectations are too high. Considering how here you are paying less than in some sharedbedroom hostels, I really have no reason to complain about anything. Obviously not downtown, but a metro station with ticket machines is a 10 minute walk away, and that will easily get you anywhere in Paris. Definitely feels more like renting a small studio in an appartment building rather than a fancy hotel stay, but again, you shouldn't be expecting too many amenities for a price like this. I'd definitely come back here again in the future. Great value for money 45 minutes by bus from the centre friendly staff would definitely stay again Stayed three nights, WiFi never worked, talked to employees twice and it never got fixed. Room looked nothing like the photos on their website, smelled of cigarettes and bathroomsshowers werent that clean. Walls are thin, so I could hear both my next door and above neighbors late at night and early in the morning.
Price is too high for the condition of the property, especially for hostel standards. Theres no way I would stay here again. PLEASE dont book this place!!! our room was infested with bed bugs and had them crawling all over the pillows and mattress. we had to leave and find somewhere else to stay last minute. the owners are definitely aware of the issue and arent fixing it so dont waste ur money.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Maison Chomel,"15 Rue Chomel, 75007 Paris, France",4.6,48.851933,2.325329,"Delightful experience overall. Kind and helpful staff and spaces were beautifully decorated.
We did not take advantage of breakfast but did appreciate the coffee machine.

Rooms are small but thats more an FYI, not a problem, just a reality of city hotels. More hooks on the walls would be a nice touch! We LOVED Maison Chomel for our 4day stay. It felt like our wonderful, cozy home away from home in Paris. The hotel has the kindest, most helpful staff who made us feel safe and welcome. The location was perfect, free of touristy crowds and only steps away from transit stops that made it super easy to get to other arrondissements. It was a fabulous find and absolutely the best choice. Already dreaming of coming back! This hotel is 5 star in everything! From the time of booking, to getting to the hotel, the entire stay, until departure. Maison Chomel is home. The location is very safe, it is close to everything and easily accessible by bus or train or by foot. So many nice places around walking distance. I felt safe in the hotel since there was always someone at the desk securing the place 247. Its homey, they know us by name. And the rooms very elegant. We had a 2bedroom adjoined with a main door that allowed us to keep both rooms unlocked at all times with easy flow to the other room. They kept our rooms very very clean every day. The hotel has the Parisian foundation with modern designs. Beautiful boutique hotel is love to come back to. The owners took care of us when we needed anything and they gave us directions and tips during our stay until the time we went to the airport. Nas even checked on us when we reached the airport making sure our travel went smoothly. What a super host! I cannot recommend Maison Chomel enough! The service was exceptional and the room very clean and comfortable. Everyone on staff was extremely friendly and made us feel right at home! They knew us by name, asked us about our day, provided us with restaurant and sightseeing recommendations, and were just wonderful overall. They even gave us umbrellas  to use during our rainy stay, making it possible for us to still walk and see everything we wanted! The location is right in St. Germain, making it easy to access multiple sites within a 1520 min walk. I highly recommend this hotel and cannot wait to return for my next visit to Paris! We thoroughly loved our stay at Maison Chomel. The street was quiet and safe, the rooms were exceptionally clean, the staff were friendly and professional. The location was perfect for our vacation. We definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely come back again.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
International Youth Hostel,"75011, 10 Rue Trousseau, 75011 Paris, France",3.0,48.8510685,2.3787671,"Very basic. No air con. No towels unless pay. No soap. A cleaner put our clothes in a puddle of water which developed after a short shower.
1 key per room and there was 4 of us. The last person to leave is supposed to give them the key.
Between 1100 and 1500 you cannot be in the room. However, even at 1000 they kicked my friend out.

Great location and luggage storage. Rooms include safes. Stayed here while the Olympics were on. Location is good, we found the staff friendly but not much else.

Had very weird rules that you couldnt be in your room between 11am3pm, and you had to hand your key in every time you left?

The room was dirty, mould on the shower curtain and didnt provide a bath mat.
Would not stay here again We booked to stay here without reading the reviews properly, and were very nervous coming into it. Due to the Olympics being on everything was super expensive and we didnt have a choice. Our rooms were not as bad as some other people described, but were still dirty. Manageable with some shower shoes.

Lots of weird rules in this place have to hand in key whenever you leave, must leave the property from 113 each day. One day we tried to drop off our laundry after this and the reception was very cranky  followed us up and waited at the door. Dont book this place if you arent happy with those rules.

Location is great, but the street below can be noisy at night.

If you have other options, go with those. I have mixed feelings leaving this hostel. Whilst it was in a great spot with heaps of great restaurants and bars around it, there were a few disappointments. We didnt realise when we booked that you have to be out of your room from 11am3pm and couldnt even put stuff away or access any of your things. The bathroom was also the smallest bathroom I have ever seen and was so mouldy, definitely bring some shower shoes. Despite that, the actual room was very clean, a good size and the beds were comfy. The free breakfast was good and staff were nice. Overall a good place to stay if your on a budget but would I rush back? Probably not. Awful services, you have to get out everyday at 10 am and you cannot return to the room until 3pm  feels like checking out and in everyday. And the must weird rule, they obligate you to leave your key with three every time you live the hostel. The room  is poor, and they clean it very superficially. No air conditioner or a fan for summer nights. I would never stay at this place again",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
JO&JOE Paris Gentilly,"89-93 Av. Paul Vaillant Couturier, 94250 Gentilly, France",4.5,48.8163491,2.3382857,"We booked a room for four people and when we came in they said that our room is meant to be for five people but well have the whole place for ourselves. The rooms where very nice and put together and so were the bathroom. The prices are also pretty good and value for money. The hostel is located in a pretty decent area a little bit far from the center but close to the public transport station. The vibe of the hostel is pretty artistic and chill. Would recommend Enjoyed my stay here. The in suite bathroom was nice to have. There were 5 beds in my room, and I was traveling solo. Each bed is private enough which makes you feel like you have your own corner or cubby or the room. Gentilly station is a few blocks away which gives you easy access to all of Paris and beyond.

I would stay here again. I did enjoy my visit. Only complaint is that the food wasnt the greatest. But its fairly priced and you do get a discount if youre staying at the hostel. Easy to find and a nice place to stay. Can't ask for more if you're just looking for a place to crash for a couple of days while enjoying the rest of Paris.

Everything can be done online, although it's a tad bit irritating to receive emails from them. They sometimes pay too much attentions on you  JOJOE Paris Gentilly provides a vibrant atmosphere, particularly in its restaurant and bar area where live music is a highlight. Social spaces are appreciated, though cleanliness in those areas can be improved. Room designs are generally liked, but noise levels and cleanliness within the rooms are common concerns. Service and value receive mixed opinions. Some find the staff friendly, while others criticize additional fees and perceive services as overpriced. Very, very hospitable. Thank you all for your amazing service and kindness!

You do have to trek a fair bit to all the great bits of Paris, but the station is only 3 buildings away, so very easy to get to and safe at night!

I had a cabin suite, which felt a lot more claustrophobic than I was expecting. It was quite a tight space, and it could've done with a window and more standing room to make it worth all the money. However, the bed was immensely comfortable, you have access to chargers, and the lights are very warm. Would stay again, but probably a full ensuite next time!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Staff were so friendly and decorations were classy. Highly highly recommend Never explored Paris so effortlessly. When we say a hotel that makes you definitely visit next time is must be services good, sleep well and energy in daytime. Suit for city explorer and even you can explore quite a bit in the hotel. Tea in lobby really nice for a exclusive appointment with friends in Le Maris but not overwhelming by the crowds. Everything was great. The rooms were comfortable and clean though a little small but its a boutique so that was expected. The bathrooms have nice huge tubs which was a plus after walking all day. The common areas were so cool and inviting, and the staff was helpful without being over the top about it. We chose not to take the breakfast. There are many spots outside with lots of options. The place is one of the most lovely hotel Ive ever been to. Its what I call luxury quiet meaning that its beautiful and luxurious without doing too much. I loved the junior suite with the beautiful bathtub, the wood around the bed. The little outdoor terrasse downstairs.
Extra 5 starts for the service and the staff members who were just adorable.
All of this in the heart of Paris in le Marais. Will definitely come back ! It was the perfect place to explore and relax  a very intimate and discreet hotel in the heart of marais. With cozy bathtubs and vinyls. Truly a delight, will come back soon ","Monday: 12:00 AM – 11:50 PM

Hotel Fontaines du Luxembourg,"4 Rue de Vaugirard, 75006 Paris, France",4.3,48.8490372,2.3401334,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Staff was very welcoming and attentive. Location was perfect for us, very close to Luxembourg Gardens. Great restaurant right outside of the hotel.
We knew that rooms are smaller than what we used to, so it was not a surprise. Air conditioning was working, elevator was working as well. We were on a 4th floor, no neighbors next to us, so very quiet and comfortable. Bathroom was clean, water pressure was great. Cleaning staff was doing excellent job.
Bed was very comfortable with nice pillows, duvet cover on the comforter.
We also had an electric tea kettle, so we could make a nice cup of tea in the room.
When we had a problem with the sink, it was addressed immediately and fixed before we came back to the room later than day.
We would highly recommend this hotel! Location can't be beat, nice quiet side street but easy access from airport and RERMetro only a few minutes walk as well as many restaurants nearby. Staff was helpful and courteous. Rooms were a bit cozy but comfortable, would not hesitate to come back. I never write reviews but this hotel deserves one. Been to Paris multiple times and this little gem has earned my loyalty. The room, amenities, and breakfast were great but the customer service received from front desk guys Eric and Usman was exceptional. They were extremely helpful and so accommodating. This may be a 3star hotel but felt like a 5star Hotel. Thank you to everyone at Hotel Fountaines du Luxembourg we will definitely see you next time we are in Paris. Spent 8 days at this most splendid hotel. It is located steps from Luxembourg Garden. Ride the RER B to the Luxembourg stop and wheel your suitcase a short walk to the hotel. The hotel is wonderful, but the hotel staff is extraordinary. This is a very quiet area at night and deep sleep is possible. The staff will be there for questions, problems, suggestions. There is always someone at the front desk.The manager is hands on and excellent. You really feel at home every time you return to the hotel. The room is cleaned daily. Every area of the hotel is clean and cared for. Food, drinks are available at the hotel for a charge. A small convenience store right across the street. Walk to bus and metro. Walking distance to several historic sites. Complementary coffee available in a lovely lounge. Luggage storage. A one person elevator. Our room was very large by Paris standards. Was so sad to leave this hotel. We loved our stay here. We really enjoyed our stay in the Hotel which was a very special historical building, all the staff in the reception were fabulous, kind, helpfull and professional, especially Eric and Azim.

Les Rives de Notre-Dame Hotel,"15 Quai Saint-Michel, 75005 Paris, France",4.6,48.8532403,2.3457375,"We had an exceptional stay at this hotel. The staff went above and beyond to make our experience unforgettable. Their warm and welcoming nature truly stood out.

The location is amazing, with convenient parking nearby. The rooms are beautiful and impeccably clean.

Thank you for making our trip to Paris even more special!! Staying at the Les Rives de NorteDame Hotel Was one of the highlights of our Paris trip. The hotel itself was beautifully restored. Blending the historic building while adding updated conveniences that all travelers want to experience was done amazingly well!water pressure was amazing and our shower and bathroom were clean and kept tidy by Cedric
everyday!Thank you Cedric! We found our accommodations to be comfortable and well equipped with everything we needed to make the most perfect stay. The staff Dino,
Elisa and Serge were genuinely helpful and kind and offered many suggestions for us to experience the best of local activities while visiting Paris! The good the room is tight but cute, and the space is efficiently used so you dont feel cramped. The bed is comfortable, and the pillows are good for hotel pillows i.e. these actually have support. The shower is fantastic  great water pressure. The location is also incredibly convenient, whether youre traveling within Paris or coming from the airport.

The canbeimproved the WiFi is a bit spotty in the rooms I have found that when I leave the hotel and return, I have a hard time reconnecting to the WiFi and have to forget the network and relog in. Housekeeping also doesnt make up your bed if you opt to not change your sheets. The best thing is the position, super central near Notre Dame and facing the river, with the exit of the tram station two steps away. The room that I took was small but likeable and the bathroom too. The common ambiance nice looking and the staff always polite. Given the price, all really great. Absolutely loved our experience even if it was just a single night. Elisa was so incredibly helpful and patient. The breakfast was terrific and everything on the tray was delicious. It even pleased my son, the picky eater! The bed was marvelously comfortable and the windows offered a splendid view across the way to Notre Dame. Not a single complaint.

MAISON 46,"46 Rue de la Croix Nivert, 75015 Paris, France",4.1,48.8458728,2.2983399,"We flew into Paris today and the staff was very accommodating at check in. Our room seemed fine, until we found a bed bug crawling on us while laying in bed. Along with there being black stain that looked like mold or an icky bug webbed nest of some kind in the left upper corner of the room. They were very understanding as we brought the bed bug, down in a cup to show them. I put water in the cup so the bug couldnt crawl around anymore. They relocated us and are intending on checking the room the next day. As much as they handled it professionally,  freaked us out, its our first time in Europe too so this was a bit startling to deal with. Amazing rooms, with amazing view of Eiffel Tower , friendly staff and professional, ready to help and answer all your questions.

The only minus is that you can hear the noise from the other rooms, in rest everything perfect 
Highly recommended!!  I recently stayed at this hotel from July 20th to July 23rd, 2024, and unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. One of the most significant issues I encountered was being charged twice the city tax. For two people over three days, the total came to over 80 euros, which is exorbitant and unacceptable.

The staff's incompetence exacerbated the problem. They were unhelpful and unable to resolve the issue efficiently, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied with the service provided.

Based on my experience, I would not recommend staying at this hotel. The double charging of city tax and the poor staff performance are major red flags. There are likely better options available that offer more reliable service and transparency in their charges. I want to raise awareness about a scam involving a fraudulent accommodation service I encountered. I recently made a booking through Booking.com, and the day after, I received a request to change my card details and pay money through a suspicious link.

This is a scam designed to steal your credit card details! Booking.coms customer service was unhelpful and did not respond to my report. Fortunately, I disputed the charge with my bank and avoided the scam.

Avoid them!!! !

Please be cautious when making online bookings and always verify the authenticity of any payment requests. Cute hotel, but definitely a mixed bag overall.

Pros
Staff was very friendly, managed everything well, booked a taxi to the airport for us. The location is excellent, very walkable to the Eiffel Tower, and a few small businesses located around the hotel for convenience. With our room on the 5th floor in the back of the building we could see the top of the Eiffel Tower. Room service was always good and very quick.

Cons
The room itself was nice except for the water damage in one corner. There was what appeared to be some black mold near rhetorical ceiling, and the wallpaper was peeling off, presumably because of water entering. The heating was a bit annoying to work, since the radiators took a while to change the room temperature. The room also lacks a mini fridge, but since I was there in winter I was able to put my drinks on the balcony to keep them cold. Walls are also a bit thin, and we often heard the neighboring rooms talking.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Rivoli,"2 Rue des Mauvais Garçons, 75004 Paris, France",4.0,48.8567991,2.355139099999999,"The positives
 the location is great
 the staff are friendly
 very reasonable checkout time up to midday
 views from the top rooms are pretty nice.

On the other hand
 the rooms are small and very simple
 no elevator, which means bringing your suitcase potentially up six flights of stairs
 the WiFi is temperamental
 the walls between rooms are thin, which means, if you are unlucky like I was and get some inconsiderate, rude person repeatedly using a hair dryer at 6am on a Saturday, you are going to hear all of it.

If you don't mind climbing lots of stairs and have a good pair of earplugs and have plenty of data, it's not a bad option. Personally I wouldn't return. Rooms are plain but very clean. Bathroom small but with quite big shower. Nothing looks aged. Great view from the mini balcony. Staff great and helpfull. Localisation  awesome! Just by the metro and close to the big metro hub. Beware of the stairs, there is no lift, as common in this part of the city. I will definitely come back to the hotel if I am again in Paris Near to everywhere! Clean rooms! Very good area! Warm and helpful  people at the reception! For sure to book there at next trip ro Paris! Rooms are tiny, more like a jail cell.
No elevators, but this is ok, if the rest was good.
It is located right above the restaurant and music a loud boomboomboom in the restaurant is on till 2 am. Which of course is against the law. Restaurant guests are parting on the street right  under your windows.
The strange thing is that concierge would not do anything about it. While gusts cannot get any rest. Absolutely amazing, room was super clean and the people lovely. They replaced our towels and made our bed on the daily without us asking. They take care of your luggage if you arrive before check in.

Location is phenomenal, close to all the small quirky places  bars but also perfect to get a metro to all the attractions  literally 3 minute walk to the metro , 2 more minutes on the metro and youre at the Louvre

Its a classic boutique hotel that for me really shows the Parisian experience the only thing is the elevator is small so if need a more accessible way for wheelchairs and what not Id say ask Adorable hotel in great location with plenty of delicious restaurants and great shopping nearby. Room was small and shower oddly did not have a curtain. But other than that we loved staying here! Left the hotel after a 1 night stay. Price for my 6th floor, room 29 for the night was very reasonable at 115 euro. 3 minute walk from metro stop. Lovely and safe area in Paris. Rumour has it that Henry Miller the writer stayed at room 29 for an extended period of time so that's a bonus. Lift was very small and can only fit one person with luggage. Did not bother me. Very easy to get to the hotel from Gare du Nord. Just hop on the metro number 4 and you will be able to reach the hotel in 20 minutes. Basic 2 or 3 star hotel. Clean, friendly staff, good size room for Paris. Tiny liftelevator but to be expected. Beds comfortable. If you are looking for a budget friendly hotel this could be it.

Hotel Antin Saint Georges,"21 Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, 75009 Paris, France",3.1,48.8779554,2.3378432,"My room had a very strong chemical smell, and the bed sheets had a different smell more like body odor.

Everything looked super old, but not dirty.

The only good thing about the room were the mattress and the pillows. But it's hard to sleep when you're concerned about breathing chemicals...

Read the other comments. Surely not the worst hotel in Paris, by far, but there may be good alternatives. Upon arrival at 9AM, we were told there was no baggage hold and directed to use an app to find a location that would hold our luggage for 6 per bag and that we had to come back at 2PM to check in. We had to walk 15 minutes to the only convenience store that was open for holding our bags. We booked a bigger room through Expedia with 2 beds and upon check in at 2PM, they gave us two small rooms with space big enough for the bed only Rooms 104  105. There was NO AC. The bathroom hadnt been cleaned hair on the tub and there was only one electrical outlet so we had to make a decision between a fan or charging our phones. The pictures and rating on Expedia are misleading. Would not recommend!! Its a place to stay but not nice by any means. It was super old, the floors creaked, and the bathroom was very outdated. It was 26 for on person for one breakfast. The breakfast was very small. Very small lobby and tight elevator. The door handle was taped together and the toilet and sink to wash your hands were on opposite sides of the room. However it is close to a metro station. Lovely people at this Hotel. The service is great and we would love to come back. The location is also very good. Great location, classic Parisian atmosphere and enjoyable breakfasts made for a happy stay!

Likes The room was excellent with very comfortable beds, and clean bedlinen. The hotel in general was very clean overall. We loved the architecture of the building, and the excellent location. It was a tad old fashioned in the bedrooms, but that was what we both liked. We had a room at the rear of the hotel so not the best veiws, but totally quiet. It felt very welcoming however, with the bedrooms having fitted carpets instead of the usual, noisy laminate flooring  with us both having two very lively young children with us 9 and 10 years old. We found the staff really nice to talk to, and were always polite and helpful. The main receptionists, Julien, was really pleasant chap, and we hit it off with him very quickly. Also the darker haired, shorter, older lady who made up the breakfasts each morning was really nice too though she did not speak that much english, we really got on well with her The breakfast's were superb, with a wide choice of fresh pastries and croissants, meats and cheeses etc. The glasses and crockery were always spotlessly clean too. Rue des Martyrs, in the next street is highly recommenced for shoppers looking for great wines, pleasant cafes, and some great shopping. Overall we loved the hotel and are definitely intending to return, using it as our base to explore a lot more of beautiful Paris.

Disliked  Being English, I really wish we had tea and coffee making facilities in the bedrooms. Though we found out towards the end of our star we could help ourselves 247 to the hot water urn in the dinning area to make tea and coffee, so this gripe was mitigated against.

The bedrooms could do with a lick of paint at some point, and we wished the shower hose had a wall attachment in our bathroom. But overall these were two small things to us, and did not affect our enjoyment of staying at the hotel.

We will be looking forward to be coming back at some point, regardless. Our experience staying at this hotel, as a family did not correspond to the negative reviews on google. We both felt the price, was good for the loccation in Paris, and what the hotel had to offer. Many thanks to Julien, the pleasant lady who did the breakfasts, and all the staff at Hotel Antin St Georges, you made our stay very special!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hotel Cluny Square,"21 Bd Saint-Michel, 75005 Paris, France",4.3,48.8515447,2.3434735,"Currently on night 3 of 4 and have no complaints. Everything has been perfect. The location is amazing! The room is clean, and the bathroom is beautiful. We have a room on the second floor and views of SaintMichel and SaintGermain. I am a light sleeper and have no issues sleeping through the night. Our first night here my daughter and I ended up sleeping 22 hours straight from all the travelling. The room is exactly the same as shown on the website room 201 with a deep purple walldeep purple curtains.

I spent hours researching hotels and I couldnt be happier with our choice. The location cant be beat, staff members are extremely friendly, and the rooms are cute and comfortable.

As stated in another review, you do have to hold the shower head to shower at least in our room. The tub is deep and great for a nice bath. Very comfortable room and bathroom! Great shower. Reception staff is super nice. Breakfast is very nice also. I'm just taking one star because even though we had do not disturb on our door, the cleaning staff were just making too much noise chatting loudly in front of our door. We had one on the 5th floor with balcony and nice view over boulevard St Michel. Small room with little room to move. We ordered with champagne service to our room ordered directly from their website at booking time. Very reasonable price.
Breakfast was large but excellent, each is given a basket of baguette, croissant, orange juice and yogurt plus direct order of coffee from the server. You can get more if you prefer from the shared table. All were fresh and delicious. Staff was very friendly.
Definitely will come back. Good location. There was nothing to hang the shower head, you need to hold it with one hand and have a shower with otherroom was small but okay. Elevator is from the first floor, this can be challenging for big suitcases considering the narrowness of the old building. The location is excellent, however it lacks the knack of customer service. The fulltime woman who is the manager is not friendly at all, and needs a lot of customer service training.
The hotel only has an elevator starting at the second floor of the building which makes it difficult to carry your suitcases if they are on the larger and heavier side. The spiral staircase from the ground floor is very uncomfortable when carrying several bags or people going up and down. There is minimal to no lobby on the 2nd floor where the main floor is. The rooms were nice and small overall very comfortable. we stayed a week and wished we had known about the elevator situation or that we didn't pay for the whole week in advance.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Auberge de Jeunesse BVJ PARIS / OPÉRA-MONTMARTRE,"1 Rue de la Tour des Dames, 75009 Paris, France",3.4,48.8776909,2.3340191,"Reception and everyone we met here were so nice! They were kind enough to upgrade our room without being asked and allowed us early checkin. Facilities are beautiful and clean. I've stayed at plenty of hostels the last couple weeks but this one was by far one of the best for cleanliness and service. Area was very convenient to lots of shops and restaurants and felt very safe. The daily breakfast was delicious. Would easily recommend to budget travelers of the area. My brother and I stayed here for one night and when we got here we immediately were impressed by the building. It's rustic and beautiful, with soothing classical music playing as soon as you walk in. The reception and staff were very kind and helpful as well and let us check in early at no extra cost. Definitely recommend! Service was next level. The only con was that they didnt accept credit. I had to exchange dollars euros at the gare de est, 2 hours out of my way. This hostel was homey, and accommodating. It was like having like a first sleepover at a new best friendss house. I got a mixed room, and was happy to see the other guests were mostly young men with similar interests. The staff was incredible! they updated us to a private suit free of charge because they couldnt get us all into a mixed room together. The atmosphere is delectable as well, with marble flooring in the lobby, ornate crown molding and a gorgeous color scheme. I felt safe here and well taken care of. Would recommend!! its been a good experience staying 3 nights here. I didnt find the bad reviews to be accurate. The staff were great and facilities clean.

Great location and theres always very helpful staff in the lobby. They clean the showers and bathrooms daily. Wifi works but i chose to primarily use cell service. Also has a nice courtyard areagarden. I used hostel world to book my first night and had no problems extending my stay night by night at the front desk.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The People Paris Marais,"17 Bd Morland, 75004 Paris, France",4.0,48.8501827,2.3629828,"This is probably the most beautiful and clean hostel Ive ever stayed in. Would return. Things to be aware of small kitchen with two small fridges for the whole building was too full to add things great and accessible locker storage area but does cost restaurant area on floor 2 is stunning and seems ok to work there on a laptop solid and private bunk beds but do check your bed light turns off properly before its late at night I had an issue with mine. I went here for a quick 2 day break in Paris while my home in London was being repainted, it was the first time I had ever gone to a hostel before and was my best experience staying anywhere ever! I made many new friends and found it so fun and friendly. They had a common room downstairs with games, food etc! And it was so cheap I might as well live there. Next time I go to Paris, definitely coming back here, and has encouraged me to go to more hostels in the future!  Arrogant and unprofessional

During my stay, I encountered unprofessional and unhelpful behavior from the reception staff. On the morning of my checkout, I faced a frustrating situation the bathroom in my room was occupied, and the public bathrooms were full. In a rush, I used the bathroom designated for people with disabilities. I want to emphasize that I did this out of necessity, not choice. In an ideal scenario, the hostel staff would have shown understanding and empathy instead of placing blame on the guest.

Furthermore, the cleaning staff on the fourth floor at 715 AM repeatedly tried to force open the bathroom door despite it being occupied. All happened within 1 minute, I reacted immediately very loud that she has to go away and stop opening the door because Im dressing myself! This behavior was both loud and disrespectful. When I tried to explain the situation to the reception, I was met with the same unfriendly attitude and was unfairly blamed. I was told to use bathrooms on higher floors, but my key card did not work for those areas.

For a hostel to truly excel, the staff should approach each situation with professionalism and compassion. Guests facing difficulties should receive support, not additional stress. Clear communication, understanding, and a willingness to assist are key to ensuring a positive experience. Unfortunately, this experience fell short of these standards, highlighting the need for improvement in guest service and handling.

Au revoir forever! Very cute hotel that's quite aesthetic. I felt very safe in the hotel, in the mixed rooms and around the hotel as a first time solo female traveler  the location is great. Only down is that the AC seemed to have problems so it was quite hot in the middle of the night. The shower does indeed use a button that provides water for short intervals, but the rest was good, so if you don't mind that I would still recommend this youth hotel.

I would also suggest to the hotel if they see this review to put one chill room for people to work and another to socialize so that people in rooms can go to the right hang out spaces to connectget things done UPDATE
The response to my review shows how disorganized this hostel is.  Blaming us for not respecting our allocated beds?  We had booked a full private room for 3 people, we were never assigned beds!

The actual hostel rooms are comfortable and well designed. No AC. Stayed in a PRIVATE room, not a public dormitory, and was woken up to find a staff member going through our bags, asking who had slept in which bed, inspecting every inch of the room.
We did not have assigned beds, we had booked the entire private room.
Didnt feel like our belongings were safe as staff would enter and leave the room as they wanted. Paid a lot for private room and felt like we were being constantly checked in on by camp counsellors.
When we asked management to explain why staff kept coming into our private room, they did apologize and said that this should not have happened.  Yet, that doesn't make up for us being woken up to a stranger in our room after we paid over 1000 CAN for a 3 night stay.
Seems to be very disorganized.  Wouldn't stay here again, which is unfortunate, because this hostel has so much potential.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hôtel de la Comète,"196 Bd de la Villette, 75019 Paris, France",4.0,48.8821824,2.3705358,"The noise from the street made it hard for me to get much sleep, even with a 5th floor room.  That was too bad, as otherwise, the hotel was great.  The staff was friendly and helpful, the bed was comfortable, the included breakfast was fine, the location so close to a metro was great, the bathroom was fine, and the price was good.  The elevator was temperamental, but it was better than no elevator.  Note that the reception desk and elevator are on the second floor, so there are still steps that are unavoidable. Never, ever, stay here. Where to start? Woredown hotel that needs to be way cheaper, in order to justify its price. Extremely rude staff, that treat you like they are letting you stay as a favor. Bathroom sink doesnt work, bed is itchy, shower doesnt have a door or curtain, towels are rundown. No power sockets near the bed, lamps dont work. The room gets super hot and not even a fan. Talked to the manager and we got a nasty scolding about spending too much time in the room we are paying for! pros the price and vicinity of Gare du Nord by metro
The room was very very old and the blanket was ruined maybe by a sigarette. It was also very noisy. Friendly staff, even though it didnt feel very safe to leave the room key every time we left the hotel to later only tell them the number when we got back. Only one of the staff wanted to confirm the number with our name.

The price meets the standards. The rooms are kind of weird and dont have either AC or a fan so we had to leave the window open during night  which meant much noise. Some rooms didnt even have a window.

Overall it was clean. Extremely easy to get to the city.

If you cant afford a better hotel this is okay, but Id prefer a nicer one next time. Rooms are nice. But the service is shitty. They are not clear in the rules except one to submit the keys before leaving even you go out for 2 mins. What is this rule of submitting the key. I booked the hotel for 2 nights. I had to submit my keys at least 10 times. I was fed up on this. Even they don't allow friend's visit in the daytime. It's not at all worth spending on this apartment.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Boutique Hôtel Mareuil Paris,"51 Rue de Malte, 75011 Paris, France",4.7,48.86597399999999,2.3675037,"Overall this is a decent hotel in a convenient location. We had decent sleep for the first couple nights while they had AC operating. Unfortunately during the last night of my stay when they switched from AC to heat, we couldnt sleep at all the entire night because the room was too hot and we couldnt fall asleep with the window opened because of the loud noise from pedestrians outside. Their blanket is super thick, making the situation even worse. Their rooms dont have individual heatAC control as its all central for the entire hotel. My stay couldve been perfect if their rooms had standalone heatAC control and a better hair dryer. My friends and I stayed here for 5 nights at the end of April. We primarily chose this hotel for two reasons, being situated in quaint street off Le Marais and the connecting rooms they offered. Unlike in the USA, where rooms are adjoined by an interior door, their connecting rooms didn't have an interior door but an additional exterior door that opened up to two separate rooms. Initially, we were confused but all worked out at the end. It just gave more privacy to each rooms than what was expected from American standard to be clear.

Staffs were super helpful and friendly. Rooms were small yet kept very clean and decorated nicely. Beds were comfortable. We used their dry sauna and steam rooms a couple of nights and it was lovely. We were able to make reservation for private use of the spa which was a bonus. They offered complimentary espresso and bubbly soda through out the day and we absolutely indulged on that. The breakfast cafe is in the ground level and offered a great spread of continental as well as hot breakfast items like scrambled eggs and sausages.

My room came with a divider bathroom area and a tub for the shower. I had a drainage issue with the tub but a maintenance was called upon as soon as I notified it and fixed the issue on the spot. Overall a solid hotel. The rooms were a bit dated and not as nice as what I would expect for paying a little more than 200  night but other aspects of the hotel were good.

It is located close to oberkampf and republique metro which are on the main subway line. Additionally it is close to Utopia Bakery which is a fantastic bakery and is close to a few notable cool streets like rue de temple.

The staff are also very friendly and helpful. They helped us regain access to our hotel room and also conveniently provided umbrellas for us when we needed them. There is also staff manning the door at night so they keep an eye on things going on around the hotel. Loved my 4 night stay at the hotel. Staffs are all so friendly, hotel let me store my luggage there 1 day before my stay begins. My top floor room were extremely quiet. Hotel itself was comfortable, modern, with all the amenities 247 coffee machines and watersparkling water dispenser. Also very conveniently located between 2 stations that are 5mins walk away. We were only supposed to stay here for one week for a work trip but ended up extending for 3 weeks. The NICEST STAFF. they let us keep our luggage in a room for 3 days because we had to step out for a couple days. they also were extremely helpful when we needed extra towels or other little things for the room.  Usually, hotel staff are a bit stiff and uppity ... but the hotel staff here felt very friendly  human  just so so so easy to talk to.

HIGHLY HIGHLY would recommend staying here over any other hotels. worth every .",no operation time,"city_hall, lodging, local_government_office, spa, point_of_interest, establishment"
Eiffel Turenne Hotel - Paris,"20 Av. de Tourville, 75007 Paris, France",4.6,48.8542406,2.3074894,"Located within 15 minutes comfortable walk from Eiffel Tower and the River Seine in a bustling area full of bars and restaurants.
The hotel is quite compact with a small reception area and lounge for pre booked breakfast No diner or bar on site.
Staff friendly, polite and helpful with advice and speak multiple languages.
Access to the rooms is via stairs or a very small lift, which is just big enough for 3 people without luggage.
I personally would say Not wheelchair friendly.
The rooms are small, not much space between the bed and furniturewalls for walking around, but was very clean  tidy, a kettle and teacoffee etc are provided.
A small bathroom had a shower best I've ever had in a hotel sink  toilet. All towels provided.
Our double bed was quite comfortable with clean linen and 2 pillows.
We were 3 floors up and could not hear traffic noise from our window, No balcony.
If you are visiting for 23 nights this would be perfectly adequate as a base, reasonably priced and good location for sightseeing. Very nice and helpful staff.  They were great about everything and very helpful.  Even tolerated by bad French attempts.  The location is excellent.  Near the Eiffel tower, dining, the metro.  And across the street from a laundromat if you need to do laundry for a longer stay.  The rooms are small, but that is to be expected for the location and price point.  If you are staying in Paris to see the sights and not the inside of your room, you will be fine.  Breakfast was perfect for the occasion. Rooms are of course on the small side, but that's typical of Paris. Bathroom is a bit dated, but has all of the necessary bits. It would be nice to have at least one more hook in the bathroom and to fit another shelf in somehow since there isn't much of a vanity, but these are small complaints.  Excellent location, wonderful staff. Would stay again. Great location, superbe service. Employees are super nice and useful.
Breakfast is reasonably priced and good.
Main issues we had
1. Noise inside the hotel, acceptable but could be better.
2. Rooms are really small.
3. Corridors and stairs are small, and always with cleaning materials.

Excellent for a night or two. After that, it becomes super annoying. I recently had the pleasure of staying at a hotel conveniently located near the Eiffel Tower, and I must say it exceeded my expectations in many ways. The location alone is a significant highlightbeing just a short walk away from one of the world's most iconic landmarks made exploring Paris incredibly easy and enjoyable.

The staff at the hotel were exceptional. From the moment we checked in, they were welcoming, attentive, and always ready to assist with any requests or questions. Their warm hospitality truly enhanced our stay, making us feel right at home in the heart of Paris.

Our room was another standout feature. It was impeccably clean and wellmaintained, providing a comfortable and relaxing environment after a day of sightseeing. The amenities were modern and thoughtful, ensuring we had everything we needed for a pleasant stay.

In addition to its proximity to the Eiffel Tower, the hotel is also conveniently located near several grocery stores and a variety of restaurants. This made it incredibly easy to grab a quick bite or stock up on essentials. Whether we were in the mood for a casual meal or a fine dining experience, we had plenty of excellent options just steps away.

Overall, this hotel is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to stay close to the Eiffel Tower while enjoying topnotch service and clean, comfortable accommodations. The added convenience of nearby groceries and dining options makes it an even more attractive option for travelers. I highly recommend it and look forward to staying here again on my next visit to Paris.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Jeanne d'Arc le Marais,"3 Rue de Jarente, 75004 Paris, France",4.2,48.8555205,2.3631956,"I recently spent nine nights at a charming hotel in the Marais area of Paris, and overall, it was a delightful experience.
The hotel's location is unbeatable. Nestled in the vibrant Marais district, I was surrounded by chic boutiques, cozy cafs, and historic sites. It was easy to explore the city on foot, and public transportation was just a short walk away.
The room itself was quite tiny, which is typical for Parisian accommodations. Despite the size, it had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.
What truly made my stay memorable was the staff. They were incredibly helpful and friendly, always ready to offer recommendations and assistance. Their warm hospitality added a personal touch to my visit.

In summary, if you're looking for a central location and friendly service in Paris, this hotel is a great choice. Just be prepared for a snug room, and youll be all set for a fantastic stay! I'm not sure how this hotel has such high ratings. I would imagine that if you visit this hotel during colder months it would be okay.

I felt that I was profiled by the receptionist, being a solo male traveller. Before assigning my room, the receptionist consulted with housekeeping staff. I believe I was given the worst room in the hotel based on being a solo male traveller, room 17. As you can see from the photos, the inside room temperature was almost 30 degrees Celsius at around noon. I wanted to open my window, as the outside temperature was very pleasant. However, as you can see from the photos, my view was of the exhaust fan of the hotel's kitchen.

The provided fans did help somewhat. But again, from my photos, you can see that the fans were both caked in dust and blowing out dust bunnies. If you have dust allergies, you should avoid this place like the plague. The fans created a dust vortex in the room to the point where I felt I was coughing up a lung and my eyes were swollen.

After the first night, I booked at the Courtyard and forfeited the remaining 2 nights at this property, as I booked on Expedia, and the hotel had a no refund policy. Thankfully, I had some points to redeem. I'm convinced that the positive reviews here are fake reviews. The emails from Marie Courier also seem fake and must be the alias of the gentleman working at reception. Stayed 4 nights and the location was perfect! Great restaurants near by and super walkable to get around Paris! Staff was super friendly! And bonus that for our fam of 4 2 teens, 2 adults our room had 2 twin beds so kids didn't have to share!  Would definitely stay here again. My friend and i had this hotel reccomended, we were extremly disappointed. it is nothing like as shown on the website.
the room was very small the ensuite too small even for one person.we stayed only one night at a greater expense we found another Hotel around the corner which was four start and not a lot of difference in the price.the only positive thing i can say is the room and ensuite were clean, other wise the whole hotel needs a refurbishment. The breakfast room is nothing like it is shown on the website.i agree with other reviews i cannot understand how it gets high reviews. This hotel was unacceptable. The price gauging for the olympics may have lead me to book a lesser hotel than i would have got in this price range ordinarily and perhaps i should have spent more for a better hotel but the rooms are tiny and run down. All members of staff are rude or inconsiderate barring one lovely young man who checked me in and was there on occasion on front desk. There is no AC, there is no curtain or blinds for the bathroom window, the room has to be under 100 square foot its genuinely that small, the shower is either unbearably hot or too cold and when you finally get it right youll get a random blast of hot water come through without touching anything, all of the walls are paper thin i had little to no sleep thanks to screaming babies and hearing everything on the hotel floor, the stairs are not safe to walk down they are so wonky, i asked in the survey they sent me before arrival that my room would not be cleaned for the duration of the stay and this was ignored by the cleaners every single day, who would try and force entry even if i was asleep or in the shower, theyd wake me up and only take no for an answer after insisting repeatedly which was creepy, even when i was not present at all they moved all of my belongings around the room. They confiscate your hotel key whenever you leave, but lock the door at night so if you return from a club or bar you have to stand outside and knock, eventually they come and act surprised and annoyed that you dare come back so late, as if theyre your parents or something. I was told a different check out time but then they enforced the normal checkout time so after having a very late night thinking i had more time to check out the next day, i was awoken by a rude obnoxious man who said you must leave in the next 10 minutes then suddenly didnt understand english when i responded, saying WHAT?! as if to mock the fact im english, i dont understand your accent. WHAATTTTTT?!!! before stressing me minutes later you have to leave immediately get down here and then telling me off and laughing in the lobby infront of guests when i checked out. Because of this if it wasnt for a friends hotels kindness i would have had to walk around paris with my bags for hours before my flight. How theyre reviewed so highly i have no idea. I guess it was clean and i didnt have any of my stuff go missing.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel 4 étoiles Mansart Paris 1er - Esprit de France,"5 Rue des Capucines, 75001 Paris, France",4.6,48.86852500000001,2.329819,"Positives Great location very convenient. Very nice staff working at the hotel, very friendly. Nice classical feeling to the rooms. Well maintained.

Negatives  Bathrooms very inconvenient toilet small and position parallel to wall, shower very dated and small and not completely closed.
Daily cleaning service wasn't very thorough, trash left daily.

It was a nice stay, but I wouldn't say up to par for a ""4 star hotel""

I would probably consider it 33.5.
But priced as 4 star.

So overall nice place but not what you might expect. Wonderful experience in every sense.  Front desk  hotel staff most hospitable  met General Manager Max.  Comfy and quiet rooms with nice amenities.  Love all the comp newpapers and glossy magazines in the lobby.  Easy access to Rive Gauche and great value make this my new go to selection for Paris. Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely member of staff who gave us a free upgrade to the deluxe room. The room was stunning, very clean, lovely furnishings and a very a comfortable bed. Surprisingly, it was very quiet although you could hear people knocking about in the morning it didnt disturb us. The area itself is close to lots of shops and the metro. A great pub a few moments walk away. Id highly recommend staying here and I will be looking to come back again! Could not recommend this hotel enough! The front desk staff was friendly and welcoming. We arrived early and they were able to get us into our room by Noon with even a room upgrade! The room was clean and comfortable. The staff here truly made our first time in Paris special. You cant beat the location of this hotel. I cant wait to come back to Paris so I can stay here again. I recently stayed at a hotel in Paris and had an incredibly comfortable experience. Every staff member was exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to accommodate all my requests. Their kind and cooperative approach has convinced me to return. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for outstanding service during their stay in Paris.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Académie Saint-Germain,"32 Rue des Saints-Pères, 75007 Paris, France",4.5,48.8552596,2.3306797,"My wife and I just stayed here for the second time. We had a deluxe room, which was roomy by European standards. The hotel and rooms are beautiful, very tastefully decorated, and very clean. Beds and pillows are super comfortable. We appreciate being able to control the ac, as that is most often not the case in many European hotels. Some reviewers noted that the rooms were noisy, but we found them to be very quiet, especially since the windows are triple paned, which really helps to cut down on street noise. Breakfast was amazing, and Anna who works in the breakfast room is so sweet. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because Patricia, the manager was unwilling to help us with our simple request. We had booked and paid for a room that included a full breakfast each day which was not cheap. We ended up having to change our flight going home and had to leave that morning at 6am, well before breakfast started. Even when we gave ample notice and asked politely if we could be reimbursed for the expensive breakfast we wouldn't be there to eat, Patricia refused to do so. We thought she would be more accommodating, especially since we were repeat guests, but that unfortunately she wasn't willing to budge. Delightful hotel in a fabulous location. Easy walking or public transport to all the Paris landmarks.  Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Room was snug, bathroom a good size. Only suggestion would be that the hairdryers need updating. We will definitely be recommending Hotel Academia to friends. Beautiful little boutique hotel in Saint Germain with convenient access to metro, restaurants, shops, and walking distance to many famous sites. While the rooms may be small, that is not unusual for Paris. The staff is warm and welcoming and the breakfast fresh and delicious. We were extremely pleased with our stay at Academie SaintGermain Hotel in Paris,  France. The Front Desk Staff were very courteous, friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  We helped us immensely to get around Paris. Anna, the Lady who made our breakfasts each morning, was so friendly and did an amazing job, making sure the food was perfect and set up beautifully.  She was so happy and friendly!  Thank you to all, who made our stay so unforgettable!!! Diane and Jeff Brooks, Canada Its part of my fault that I overlooked the tiny size of their classic room 139 spft, 13 m2 when I booked the hotel. However, this is supposed to be a 4star hotel. I never expect such a hotel to have this miserably tiny room size. I had to move the bed around in order to find space to place my luggage. There are other hotels in Paris zone 1 that cost the same in other good neighborhoods with bigger rooms and better amenities. Its surprising to me that this 4star hotel doesnt come with a real hair dryer. Luckily I was able to borrow one from the front desk. Otherwise, it wouldve cost me at least one hour to dry my hair with their default hair dryer located in the tiny bathroom right next to the toilet.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Le 12 Hotel,"12 Rue de Vienne, 75008 Paris, France",4.8,48.8771463,2.3220438,"AMAZING stay at Le 12 Hotel! The hotel is newly updated and the rooms maximize the space well. Nice amenities too Nespresso coffee maker, kettle, fridge, wine open, glasses etc. The air conditioning was excellent especially after a hot day of walking the city. We had a nice little balcony with a view of the top part of the Eiffel Tower. Perfect for our needs. The staff were super helpful, offering to make arrangements for us, and providing recommendations  and directions. They have a great lobby area to hang out in and also a cute sitting area for breakfast. We mentioned it was our 30th anniversary trip and they left us some treats in our room. It's evident  customer service is important to them.  We would definitely stay again! Thanks Le 12 Hotel for helping to make our celebration extra special! We loved this hotel ! All of the staff were welcoming and friendly. The room was amazing and had a wonderful view of the Eiffel tower.  I would recommend this  hotel and would definitely stay there again.  Thank you for making our family holiday so special. My friend recommend this hotel to me  I really Love the hotel would come again!! The location is very near to everything  train station as well. We really enjoyed our stay there. The room is very nice  all the staff are really lovely especially Matthew!! We had an amazing stay at this hotel!!! First of all the staff are awesome! They were all really nice, shoutout to George for helping us multiple times!
The location is perfect and the view from our room was amazing. Would definitely stay here again! Decent stay. I would like to note that one of the cleaning ladies, who was not too friendly, would speak loudly on her cellphone while cleaning rooms early in the morning, i.e., waking me up via her conversations. The hotel is located on a quiet block close to the Europe Metro station, which was a plus.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Oops! Hostel,"50 Av. des Gobelins, 75013 Paris, France",3.7,48.83407500000001,2.3533861,"Stayed in a private room, so likely different experience. The receptionist, Paula, was incredible and really hospitable. She made the stay. She was informative, she was helpful, she was friendly, and she had no issue providing alternative solutions to several questions I had. I was very thankful for her. The bed was rather comfy and the room was a good size. The bathroom was amusing with blue lights, and there was a balcony, but not one you could even sit on, and barely stand two people on.  The walls are rather thin. Which, in a hostel, in a private room, is an issue. The people next door had copious amounts of sex at all hours of the day and it was heard. Also, the top floor gets almost no wifi reception, which is also a problem. I didn't get the breakfast, and glad for it, since it's just bread. I had hoped to be closer to things, but it was not that ideally located, I'll admit. I arrived very late at night, check in was very easy and quick. The room was nice. Even with a nice view 
The bathroom and blankets could have been cleaner Very Poor Customer Service and Substandard Facilities

I recently stayed at this hostel and I am very disappointed. The staff were extremely rude, and the customer service was terrible. Even though there were no other guests waiting in line at the reception, I was made to wait a long time for assistance on multiple occasions. They seemed aware that I needed help but chose to ignore me.

The room I stayed in was dirty and very small. The toilet was also very cramped, and there was no soap or paper available. Additionally, there was no shampoo in the shower and no towel provided unless you were willing to pay extra  a whole ten euros for a towel!

Overall, my experience at this hostel was extremely poor, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Everything about my stay was awful
 the first room I stayed in was very cramped and had no soap in the bathroom
 the bed had a significant dent and when I went to reception to ask for a different bed the following evening I didnt go in the morning since I had places to be and the employee was half asleep at the desk the employee was very confrontational and told me that I should have said something in the morning and that changing beds would be difficult. I asked her if it was difficult, as in impossible, or as in she didnt want to do it, and she told me to come back at 10pm to speak to the following employee. I asked why and she refused to answer. I kept asking her if she needed to come see the bed to understand what the problem was and she kept saying no, that it wouldnt change anything.
When I was eventually switched rooms, I was so frustrated with the horrible customer service that I cried. They did nothing to compensate and the second staff told me that I mustve been awful to this girl because shes normally not like that
 one night, the fire alarm went off for about an hour and we were made to stand outside in the rain. The power went out for over 2 hours and it was the first shift of the person working
 there is no full kitchen, and the little one they have is filled with flies and is very dirty
 the location is marketed as being in the Latin quarter, but this is a stretch, so it was not as  central as advertised
 no privacy curtains on the beds and very squeaky beds that shifted with even the smallest movement
 the lock on the bathroom door was broken and despite asking staff to fix it, it was broken the entire weeklong stay
 the internet was awful, rarely working unless you were on the main floor near the office
 saw clean and folded bedding left on the floor in the hallways by staff as they were doing housekeeping When we arrived at around 2230 there was an alarm beeping away with many people standing outside due to the incessant noise. We attempted to check in but were met with constant resistance whilst the alarm went on and off. They took my friend's passport as a deposit and when he asked for it back they wouldn't give it back, asking why he would want it back and trying to keep hold of it unless he paid in full for the booking, which at that point due to not being able to check in for a long while and the fire alarm going off for around 2 hours we wanted to go somewhere else. Eventually the power went out, causing one of my other friends to nearly get stuck in the elevator as the doors were closing as the power cut struck. Firefighters eventually came but didn't do much and left after a while, meaning it was most likely a false alarm and there was no actual fire. After a lot of arguing it was decided to show us to a room and sort it out at 8am in the morning leaving little time for sleep as by this point it was 0030. Finally we got into our room and the power was still off so we had to use our phone torches to be able to see and couldn't charge our stuff.

In the morning the hostel gave us a partial refund on our stay as condolences for the hassle and mayhem caused the night before which was nice of them.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
ibis budget Paris Porte de Montmartre,"45 Rue du Dr Babinski, 75018 Paris, France",3.0,48.90124890000001,2.3339241,"Hotel is basic for a budget hotel. Comfy beds, breakfast was pretty much cereal, fruit, croissants, ham cheese etc.  No kettle in room. Vending machines offer ready meals and microwave by reception. 10 min walk from bus stop. The area. It's a little rough. Few homeless  hanging about. Probably best to book hotel closer to city. Yes, it is  budget so you cant expect too much.
Good side is money compered to what Paris offers, we paid less but it is not worthy.

The area of the hotel is not the best, especially during the night. The reception people are extremely rude, the breakfast is poor terrible coffe, the room is basic. I recently stayed at this Ibis Budget Hotel and honestly, it wasnt a great experience. The room wasnt properly cleaned when I arrived  there was dust and dirt, which made it feel pretty uncomfortable.

To make things worse, the central AC wasnt working at all, so the room was really warm and stuffy. I did let the staff know, but nothing was really done to fix it during my stay.

For a budget hotel, I wasnt expecting luxury, but basic cleanliness and working AC should be a given. Unfortunately, I cant recommend staying here unless they sort these issues out. Location is not convinient to major landmarks. The hotel is affordable but by the time you factor in all the troubles and cost to take you places might as well pay the extra and go to a better hotel near the city center. The surrounding area doesn't look safe. Trash everywhere. The rooms are tiny, the towels are tiny and thin. The shower door has a hole, not sure what purpose it is. The only positive thing is that, the shower has good water pressure. The room is hot and you can hear all forms of noises, from cars, noisy customers, sirens, Etc. I asked for 3 beds for 3 people but was given a double bed. The breakfast is really basic. Overall, not satisfied. I had higher expectations for this hotel, but unfortunately, my stay was not as pleasant as I had hoped. While the location is convenient and the staff were generally polite, several issues made my experience less than satisfactory.

I was quite disappointed with my stay at this hotel. The room was dirty, with not clean in the bathroom. The air conditioning no worked, and the room felt too hot. bed is not clean. Overall, this hotel is in serious need of improvements, and I wouldnt recommend it.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hôtel de la Rue de Lille Paris - Saint-Germain-des-Près,"40 Rue de Lille, 75007 Paris, France",4.5,48.8585582,2.329942,"This boutique hotel is a gem! Excellent location, very clean and helpful staff. Marie at reception is a wonderful person and made my stay easy and warm. She is invaluable. We had a few chats and connected right away! This is my second time and I will be back for a third!
Thank you for helping make my stay with my daughter so memorable. I love Paris! I recently stayed at this hotel during the Para Olympics, drawn by its advertised wheelchair accessibility. Unfortunately, my experience fell short of expectations.

Upon arrival, we encountered a step leading into the lobby, making entry difficult. I later learned that a ground floor room for disabled guests was available, but it required contacting the hotel ahead of time to secure it. This option was not made clear on Booking.com, where there was no specific way to request a disabled access room. As a result, my mother, who has limited mobility, faced unnecessary challenges. The lift was too small for her standard push wheelchair, forcing her to leave it in the lobby and walk with assistance to our room, which contradicted the notion of wheelchair accessibility. Additionally, accessing the breakfast hall in the basement was also a struggle, as it was unsuitable for wheelchair use.

When I raised these issues with the staff, they refused to apologise for the inconvenience and stress caused, which was disappointing.

Regarding breakfast, the continental selection was underwhelming, and the hot water for tea was tepid from the machine, making it difficult to enjoy a proper cup. Furthermore, the service from the staff was not friendly.

I also noticed an unexplained 25 charge on my card after checkout, which turned out to be for the city taxinformation that was not made clear upon arrival. I hope other guests are made aware of this charge in advance.

I hope the hotel reviews its accessibility standards and improves both the quality of service and communication for future guests. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this hotel for those requiring true accessibility. Rooms were lovely and very clean but small with no space for suitcases and limited bathroom space.  That being said, the location was amazing, and the hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and kind. Nice little hotel, very good located one street next to the Seine. You can walk directly to the Louvre over the next bridge. Rooms are very clean, nicely decorated, but like often in Paris quite small. Breakfast is nice too. We once wanted to rent the hotel bikes, but the receptionist told us he would need a deposite over 400 Euro from us as hotel guest. It really  just seemed he did not want us to rent the bikes at all. We skipped and used the E bikes from Uber who are standing all over in Paris on the streets for rent. No deposit needed, very easy to handle. Rates per night are not really cheap, but you know, it's Paris. One of the best hotels in Paris. Location is perfect! You can even go for a walk by the river and its not in the middle of the chaotic city centre. The receptionists are lovely! She made the stay double the worth","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Molière,"21 Rue Molière, 75001 Paris, France",4.7,48.86544600000001,2.3362127,"My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel in Paris This was the best hotel I have ever been in. The rooms are full of character and charm. The building itself is quite beautiful and the workers are amazing. We first had a king size room with a gorgeous free standing bathtub. Very spacious and wonderful bath products. The towel warmer was really a nice surprise, I will be buying one for my own bathroom We went down to Nice for a few nights and came back to the Molire for our last night. We had a queen size room and while it was smaller with no bathtub, it was still a great room. The beds and pillows are very very comfortable. Breakfast was great. Location is amazing and a great Chinese restaurant right across. Location was amazing and very very walkable to a lot of bars, restaurants, museums, etc. I highly recommend this hotel. I will definitely be back. Here's your edited review

We had never been to Paris before and researched the area we wanted to stay in, along with hotels nearby. Hotel Molire had excellent reviews from previous guests. Upon arrival, the staff warmly greeted us and provided all the information we needed. Our room on the second floor exceeded our expectationsit was clean, and the bath products were of high quality. We were pleasantly surprised to find a refrigerator stocked with complimentary water, juice, and a box of chocolates. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Each morning, we enjoyed a delicious breakfast. The staff offered great suggestions and directions for dinner and sightseeing. At checkout, they arranged transportation to our Viking ship. When I return to Paris, I won't consider staying anywhere else. Don't miss Hotel Molire when you visit Paris! Great location very centrally located and 5 minutes walking to the Louvre. Great restaurants nearby.  Staff very friendly and helpful. I gave a low score for room and overall a 4 because I was in room 2 on the main floor and very close to the lounge where breakfast is served. Every morning around 6am loud carts went by my room to prep the buffet. Noisy dishes and cups clanging. Not the restful stay I was expecting. I had to put in earplugs. Worth staying here but insist on an upper floor room. Hotel Molire is one of our favourite places in Paris. So close to so many known and unknown spots it offers a very comfortable stylish but cosy atmosphere. Outstanding attentive service, individually furnished. We will always com again! Centrally located near the Louvre, lots of restaurants nearby. Walking distance to the metro station. Room was quiet and clean. We were upgraded to a room with a spacious balcony. Excellent breakfast with good service. Sauna and steamer were icing on the cake!",no operation time,"night_club, lodging, spa, bar, health, point_of_interest, establishment"
Citadines Apart’hotel Trocadéro Paris,"29B Rue Saint-Didier, 75116 Paris, France",4.2,48.86630459999999,2.285578,"I was given different information by three reception staff, and I was forced to pay for laundry, which is supposed to be free as a platinum member benefit.

They said they would refund me tomorrow, but they said something ridiculous like they couldn't refund me next morning.

Will you bring the money to my house when I get back to Japan?

I didn't get a response to my email, and it was an extremely unpleasant response, so if I don't get a response within a week, I will complain to the head office. My wife and I arrived in the night and was friendly received by the clerk doing nightshift. He explained everything during my checkin which made it very pleasant.

As I haven't stayed anywhere else in Paris before, I can't compare, but the room that we had, which was the standard one, was just perfect for us.
We didn't stay much in our room anyway as most of the time we were out exploring Paris. The bathroom was a bit dirty though with hairs on the wall and on the floor. But overall the bathroom with the bath didn't make use of it was nice and clean.

The location was also perfect for us. It was a clean neighborhood and we felt safe when coming back at midnight which I think is the most important. Also at night there wasn't much noise to be heard.
The Subway is also just 510min walk and most landmarks were very close as well. I stayed at this hotel 22nd to the 25th of December. I was very impressed with the customer service. The room was super clean, kitchen was well equipped as well. Great location within walking distance to the main tourist destination.
The entire staff was great from the young lady who took her time to write down what metro to take to Disneyland  I didn't catch her name but she worked Saturday the 23rd to the awesome breakfast buffet attendant.
I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there on my next visit. Citadines have always been very consistent. Great location, everything you need is right around the hotel. The rooms are very simple, and clean but have everything necessary, including things, you might not even think about such as a clothesline, or shoe rack. The kitchen is perfectly stocked, and all the appliances work. Will definitely be back, unbeatable value if you get it on the right day. if you get the solo traveler room, the bed may be a little firm. However, it is spotless and thats all you can ask for. The Hotel is quite good overall. The Studio have a good dimension and it's very confortable, however, this is my 4th night and there is no room cleaning, toals and bed changing which is the less positive aspect. The Breakfast is quite nice also and the Location is great!! Near Arc du Triumph, Eiffel Tower and with plenty of restaurants, great supermarket and the Metro is also near. Perfect Location indeed. I am at 5th floor and is really quiet and I don't listen any external noise. The backyard is also great!

Louison Hotel,"105 Rue de Vaugirard, 75006 Paris, France",4.6,48.845294,2.3213446,"We had a 1 night stay at Louison Hotel. When we walked in, we were instantly welcomedgreeted by the front desk.  It was such a nice stay and they upgraded our room free of charge, which was really nice of the staff to do.  The room itself was nice, although a bit small.  The bathroom was really clean and had all the standard amenities.

They do offer a nice small bites and wine in the afternoon which was really nice with some card games you can play and could socialize with the other guests there.

They do ask to return your key if you're leaving, which was super easy as there was always someone at the front desk. I recently stayed at this hotel from July 21 to July 27 with my two daughters and had a wonderful experience. The service was excellent throughout our stay. The front office staff were incredibly helpful, offering advice on what to visit and making our trip so much easier.

The breakfast was wonderful, and the room was clean and spotless. Although the room was a bit small, it didnt take away from the overall positive experience. I would definitely return to this hotel.

I truly enjoyed my stay and appreciate everything the staff did to make our visit memorable. Thank you for the thoughtful gifts upon arrival and departure. I have booked Louison Hotel for my parents for a week. They were very happy with the service, location and the room, feeling welcomed every step of the way!
Breakfast was also nice, and they appreciated being able to relax in the lobby after a day of sightseeing. My friend and I stayed three nights. The staff was beyond kind and helpful. When we left it felt like we were leaving friends not a hotel. We had an early tour one morning, and they created a take away breakfast for each of just that was delicious and just enough to start our adventure to Monets Hours  Gardens. It did not matter what time of day or night we strolled in the staff was also happy to see us and greet us. We would have conversations and it was a very personable experience.  We walked 9 to 15 miles each day and loved the location of the hotel to sites we wanted to see. We stayed at Hotel Louison for 5 nights earlier in July. Every facet of our stay was excellent. The hotel is cozy and welcoming. The staff were helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, and very kind to listen to my earnest attempts to speak French! The breakfasts were delicious, with a nice variety of choices. The location is terrific in that you can walk one direction to a busy street with more touristy restaurants  shops, or you can walk the other direction and find quieter streets with more of a local feel.

Expect smaller rooms in a historic building. Bathrooms and decor are uptodate and CLEAN.

Staff truly cares about your experience and are so great to talk to. Thank you!!! Excellent staff, they were friendly and knowledgeable.  Great location, close to train station, landmarks and shops!  The rooms were very comfy and clean.  The cleaning staff always did a great job while we were out exploring the city.  Thank you to everyone there!  We will definitely return! I stayed at the Relais Htel du Vieux Paris in April. It was an incredible vacation! The hotel was clean, and my room was a lot larger than I had expected. The staff at the hotel were very kind. The location was perfect  many of the major monuments and museums were within walking distance. Otherwise, it was a short distance to the entrance of the subway and there were plenty of bus stops nearby. Tons of wonderful food options in the area. I also really appreciated that it was quiet at night for sleeping. Id definitely stay at this hotel again when Im able to return to Paris in the future. Amazing stay in the heart of Paris! My stay at this hotel was nothing short of spectacular. The hotel exudes charm and elegance, perfectly blending classic Parisian style with modern comfort. The staff were incredibly welcoming and went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant experience. My room was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean.

The location is unbeatable  right in the heart of Paris, with easy access to major attractions like Notre Dame, the Seine River, and countless cafes and shops. Despite being in such a central location, the hotel provides a peaceful and cozy atmosphere, perfect for relaxing after a day of exploring the city.

Breakfast each morning was delicious, with a great variety of options to start the day off right. The attention to detail, from the dcor to the service, truly made my stay unforgettable. I highly recommend the Relais Htel du Vieux Paris to anyone looking for a quintessential Parisian experience. I cant wait to return! An excellent little hotel in the best location.

The only issue we had was if there wasnt a person at the front desk they would lock the entrance door we could not enter. This wasnt a big deal but at one point we were locked out for about 15 minutes and had a tour that we needed to get to at a certain time. We rang the bell several times but no one came for awhile. Just something to be aware of if youre on a schedule and need to get somewhere Location was fantastic, close enough to walk to any location if you are up for it if you have a good pair of walking shoes.
Room was well kept, had a lovely view of the street below for a reasonable price.
The staff were wonderful and super helpful, even assisted us with arranging a last minute taxi so we didnt miss our train. This was a fantastic little find for the cost! You are about a 15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. You are located in an amazing area with clothing shops. Around the corner is a great local bar. We stopped to get Asian food our first day. Very quiet and clean room. There is an elevator. Breakfast is available for purchase. Really enjoyed our stay at Hotel 31.  The location is just 10 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower.

The hotel is located in a great neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby.  We enjoyed walking to Vincent Salur each morning for a pastry and espresso.  We always felt safe walking around this neighborhood.

The hotel staff are very friendly and accommodating.  We arrived to the hotel around 8am on the day of our checkin.  They held our bags while we walked around the neighborhood.  They were able to check us in early, around 9am!

The room itself was quite small normal for European cities and clean no bed bugs!.  We found the room to be very quiet and were able to sleep well. How are we supposed to sleep with such noise? Last night, we discovered that the air conditioner was broken. The housekeeping staff asked us to turn off the AC for 20 minutes, saying it might work afterwards. However, after 20 minutes, the AC was still noisy, so we were forced to open the windows to sleep. But the outside noise was very loud, and insects flew in, so we couldnt sleep at all.

The next day, we reported this issue to the front desk again, but we only received a response that they could move us to a different room. No one proactively offered any compensation. When we requested compensation, the front desk staff said only the manager could decide that, but they didnt know when the manager would arrive at the hotel. We have yet to receive any response from the hotel, and this stay has been extremely disappointing.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hôtel Ile de France Opéra,"26 Rue Saint-Augustin, 75002 Paris, France",3.6,48.8689891,2.3346669,"Centrally located hotel with great service but small rooms. We booked a double room with bath for 6 nights. Our room was on the first floor they luckily have an elevator, faced the street, and was not actually the room type we booked as we also had a single bed in the room along with the queen bed. The layout of the room was a little odd as a result with the table with the kettle right by the entrance where there was no plug so any hot water had to be heated up from the single bed as that had a plug nearby. I was concerned about the noise, but luckily it wasn't an issue. Unlike some other reviewers, we could only hear our neighbors while in the bathroom. We couldn't hear anyone from the actual room. The AC was nice to have as our room did sometimes feel a little stuffy when we came back at the end of the day and temperatures were fairly mild during our visit. The room was bigger than some other hotel options we'd consider but it still felt small. I can't imagine trying to fit 3 people in that triple room.

The staff were all very nice. You have to leave your keys behind whenever you leave the hotel, which my friend and I ended up liking as there was no worry that we'd lose our key and be locked out of the room. Palais Garnier had greatly reduced visiting hours during our stay so one of the staff was kindly able to call their ticket office to confirm if we could buy tickets onsite as their online tickets were fully booked. They were also able to store our luggage after we checked out so we could do some additional sightseeing before our train that evening. The location is fantastic! Walking distance to Palais Garnier, Galeries Lafayette, Louvre, and Jardin de Tuileries those last two are about 15 min walks and an easy metroRER ride to everything else via QuatreSeptembre, Opera, or Pyramides, or RER Auber stations. Perfect location. Plenty of restaurants and cafes close by. Walking distance to many of the landmarks. I was there during the Olympics. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I will return. Hotel ile de France is an absolute nightmare. The manager is a disgrace to the hospitality industry. They not only threw our luggage away without explanation or apology but also refused to acknowledge their mistake. It's clear they have no respect for guests or their belongings.

Save yourself the trouble and avoid this dump of a hotel at all costs. You'd be better off sleeping on a park bench. Location was excellent for the price, short and nice walk to the louvre with multiple metro stations within a few minutes. Staff where always there to accommodate us and our needs, they remembered our names and welcomed in when ever we returned,

Room is on the cramp side but I cant really complain with the price we paid, the bed was very comfy and clean. For a short 2 night stay couldnt have asked for anything more really.

For anyone traveling as a 17 year old the hotel allowed me and my girlfriend to stay, all they needed was a signed parental consent form. Two good things and only two. Staff and location. The street is near a lot of corean and Japanese places to eat. The room was tiny and wasnt clean. I found a ticket from another person in the desk from a month ago. The bathroom had a lot of hair from other guests. We paid 400 euros for 2 nights and it feels incredibly expensive for what it is. The air conditioner looks 20 years old and is very noisy. Oh if you are travelling with a pram or you need to use a wheelchair be careful becase you need to climb stairs to use the lift and the lift is also tiny.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Rooms were cosy but I believe most of the hotel rooms in paris are alike in the size term. Stayed there for 5 nights as everything was smooth and well apart of the noise outside in the street. We were not able to sleep properly every night just because of the nightclub music noise, people and cars passing by the hotel as my room was in the first floor with a view of the hotel front. Secondly, we had to pay something called city taxes that were not included in the total payment during the checkin which cost 2.88 per person for each night, I traveled to many places and stayed in many hotels but never paid such a thing in my checkout. Ok . Only because of location. Rooms smelled like a blocked drain. Bathroom never smelled clean. Was a little late for breakfast on New Years morning 1100 and was informed that we too late and will have to help ourselves with whatever was left. Definitely not 4 service.
My two kids were stuck in the lifts this morning and almost missed their flights. Alarms in lifts dont work. Beautiful room, definitely opt for the claw foot bathtub room on the top level. Views of the Champs Elysees from the window, and some great restaurants close by.

King bed is actually larger than ordinary king beds and the room is nice and large.

The staff were so incredibly courteous with every request. I am at the hotel right now arrived today everything was perfect until i asked to turn on the AC they told me it is October and they can't put it on cold. It is still hot in mid October, I can't sleep without it. This is not good, when I booked the hotel they said AC available not a heater. This is not fair.

Hôtel Aida Opéra,"11 Rue Richer, 75009 Paris, France",4.0,48.8739759,2.3468915,"Update Ive attached photos as proof because it seems you are unaware of the situation. We stayed in room 17. I informed your receptionist about the pillow, but she was unwilling to help. She called the housekeeping lady, who gave us two new pillows one to replace the bloodstained pillow and another to replace a yellowed pillow. Neither your receptionist nor the housekeeping lady apologized for the inconvenience.

If you claim to take cleanliness seriously, you should look into the cleanliness of your hotel more thoroughly. Additionally, you might want to work on training your staff to provide better service to your guests.



Im surprised this hotel has so many positive reviews. This is the worst hotel Ive ever stayed in, and Ive experienced plenty of hotels, including some with fewer stars and lower prices.

On my fifth night, I discovered a huge blood stain beneath the pillowcase while fluffing one of the pillows. It's unacceptable for the hotel to allow guests to use such a pillow. This is beyond gross and unhygienic, raising serious questions about the overall cleanliness of the establishment.

Additionally, the walls are incredibly thin. We could clearly hear people coming in and out of their rooms, as well as all the noise from outside and the hallways.

Avoid this hotel at all costs. Im baffled by their threestar rating from the city they really only deserve one star. The accommodations are spotless and cozy, with an impeccable bathroom. The hotels position is among the finest available. The hospitality team is exceptionally courteous. Our stay was adequate. The noise level from the street was rather annoying. The room was really hot, and we couldn't seem to find the right balance from the AC. Staff were friendly and spoke good English. Breakfast was also nice. I arrived and there was a sign saying the receptionist wouldnt be back for an hour the sign underneath the handwritten note says five minutes. How on earth is that acceptable? The hotel is about 15 minutes walk away from Gare du Nord, closest metro is about 510 minutes walk away, the Louvre is about 2530 minutes walk away.  I think about 4 metro stations different lines surrounded this hotel so it was quite convenient for travelling around.

Staff were polite, the room was clean and tidy.  It had a little balcony which I was not expecting, the room got a bit too hot during the evening times and was a bit stuffy  opening the balcony door sorted this out.  My room was very spacious, it had a two single beds pushed together and there was also a sofa bed.  Plenty of hot water with toiletries supplied.

The breakfast for me was good as there were lactose free options for me  although the only hot thing was the Spanish omelette so more hot options would be good.

Wouldn't hesitate to use this hotel again!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel de Fleurie - Saint Germain des Près,"32 Rue Grégoire de Tours, 75006 Paris, France",4.0,48.852381,2.3374868,"The staff at this hotel go above and beyond for their guests. They were responsive to messages long before we stayed with them. The rooms were very clean and the bathroom was a good size. The hotel itself is in a lovely location, but on a very quiet street no noise at night. Everything is very walkable from the hotel including a lot of great restaurants. We loved our stay here. Special thanks to Nina, Alan, and Alex for their hospitality. Id recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Paris! Perfect place to stay whilst visiting Paris. It is walking distance to main attractions Notre Dam, the river and Latin quarter which is lovely. I was happy with the room a little larger than what I thought, good size bathroom for Europewith bath. Bed was large and comfy. Our room had a window which was great could let in fresh air which I like to do after being in AC all the time
Thank you Vincent for your friendly welcomes and Nina so friendly too there was another fellow I didnt know his name. I love how the hotel is just off the main road in lane way. Very handy to convenient store and everything. I would stay here again, Merci  What an absolute gem of a hotel!  I would not hesitate to recommend this delightful place with charming rooms and ambiance.  The decoration is gorgeous, exactly what you want when in Paris, and location is perfect within a stone's throw to Metro and all that Parish has to offer.  While its located close to Blvd St Michel, its a quiet haven.  Loads of restaurants and shops within walking distance.  Nina was a fabulous and generous host  offering advice and assistance whenever needed and going the extra mile to make me feel welcome and ""chez moi"".

Thanks to Nina and all the staff for making my stay absolutely perfect, it was exactly what I had hoped for and more. I honestly have no clue why this hotel has such low ratings. It has been the perfect experience for my husband and I in Paris!

Is it luxurious? Not really. But it is comfortable, clean, easy to access, nice staff, and safe? Hell yea!

Location The walk from the train station to here was easy, even with our bags on the cobblestone. Also its in a more peaceful part with walkingscooterbike access to anything your heart desires to see in Paris. The best part is its close to the metro.  I felt safe walking around the hotel area even at night.

The room I love how dark the room is for sleep. AC works great, but you have to put a key in to run it. Showers were one of the cleanest and best smelling weve had during our month long trek, but tiny as one would expect in Paris. You can take the stairs or the elevator. The refrigerator was exactly what we needed for snacks during the day and cold waters. I loved the setup because it made it feel bigger. Each side of the bed has a closet, reading light and cute little nightstand nook with plugs.

Staff 24 hour desk and they went above and beyond to help us! One night they even gave us bread after all the boulangeries were closed.

If I had any complaints Netflixsmart tv, more pillows and an extra blanket.
Then it would be luxurious! Wonderful place to stay! The staff were absolutely fantastic and they went the extra mile to help us get situated when we arrived very early in the morning. They offered us tea and coffee and fruit in the living lounge area. We needed that repose before heading out on foot to see the area. They stored our luggage and by early afternoon our complimentary upgrade room was ready. We loved the large bathroom and comfortable bed. Slept so well on it! Great pillows and a large amount of room that we enjoyed thanks to the generous offer to give us a bigger room.  wish we couldve stayed more than one night. See you next time Fleurie!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Sonder Yvette,"18 Rue Eugène Baudouin, 92170 Vanves, France",4.1,48.82731099999999,2.285546000000001,"A decent hotel, walking distance to shops and restaurants. The lift was broken during my stay which was fine but maybe don't plan to redo the carpet on the stairs at the same time. The walls felt very thin compared to other hotels I have stayed in, I was woken up all 3 nights by noises above. I can understand the other reviews about the receptionists I had a really mixed experience. Excellent hotel. Rooms were clean. Receptionist was incredibly friendly, offering great recommendations on places to visit in Paris. great stay, location is slightly further from the city area but staff are super friendly and rooms are very clean! definitely recommend Incredibly rude staff, and the check in process is a complete faffthere are much better places to stay. Is also in a very inconvenient location Sonder is generally a good hotel group, but this stay was an unpleasant surprise. The room is anything but well thought out there are no towel racks, no desk, only two hanger racks. Additionally, the lighting on each side of the bed can only be controlled from one side. As for the television, the sound is terrible. Positive point, the reception staff are very friendly and the breakfast offers excellent value for money.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hôtel Notre-Dame Saint Michel,"1 Quai Saint-Michel, 75005 Paris, France",4.2,48.8530548,2.3465361,"We loved this quirky hotel right by the Seine in Paris. We were there in early June for 7 nights. Our room had wonderful views of the Seine and Notre Dame. It was very clean with a modern bathroom. The room was quite small but we expected it to be small in central Paris. The room had a small electruc jug and cups which we werent expecting. The elevator was fine ... we were able to fit 4 pieces of luggage and the 2 of us in it. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Overall a great stay and would definitely stay here again. The best thing about this hotel was the view of Notre Dame, especially in the evening. Breakfast was basically a croissant and I think a small yogurt. There are several people that work at this hotel front desk on different days and only the one who greeted us the first day was friendly, the rest not so much. No smiles ever on their faces, and I felt like I was bugging them if I needed to ask a question. So dont expect a warm welcome. The hotel is in definite need of updating. The covering on the walls in room is weird. The carpet is really ugly, the throw blanket on the bed is old and sad but worse is the toilet that I could not get to flush most of the time because it was not operating properly and the shower leaked constantly. They did not have a shower head only handheld sprayer. I was in Paris so I made the most of it but I would recommend staying elsewhere. Also a lot of construction right below our window every morning. The hotel was conveniently located by some good restaurants. Cest La Vie  To begin with due to the Olympics we were unable to access the hotel from the other side of the Seine. After 3 hours of drivingtraffic trying to get to the hotel after a few days at Euro Disney, we had to abandon the car and walk 45 minutes with all of our luggage. We were not made aware by the hotel at booking that access would be an issue, we were not supported when we called for help getting there as we did not know if there was a bus or train etc.

The cost of the room was more than you would pay if you stayed 2 nights in a 4 star hotel. At 285 Euros per night we got the same stay at dream castle hotel and Mercure for 2 night.

What we got for the money was carrying luggage up a flight of stairs, a lift that can only fit one person very coffin like.
A room that was wonky  window area was higher than the door to room almost sloping making a disorienting feel walking around the room.
We opened the window and some plastic vent fell off.
The view was not great just of the street and cordoned off sections of the road, lots of police and noise with the river in the background.

The room and bed were far too small for my partner of 6 foot 3, it was almost like a loft room.
The walls were dark carpet and fabric and there was a chemical smell in the air, either from the fabric or recent paintwork?

There were no fire escapes and being on the 5th floor in floor to ceiling fabric like a gothic dolls house did not do it for me.

We didnt even stay Im sorry to say and I felt bad on the lady in reception as she was really nice.
Was charged straight away even though was only there for less than an hour.

Made me more aware to be careful when booking online   appears luxury online with deceptive descriptions and photos and prices but actually its a horrible, claustrophobic fire hazard waiting to happen. Over priced and in need of replanningredecorating. Great position in front of Notre Dame, nice rooms, very nice service, easy access to public transportations. Close to Louvre and Orsay museums.
We'll definitely come back!! FIRE HAZARD.  This hotel has no fire escapes, and the floors and walls of the narrow entry and central staircase are decorated with fabrics that are likely flammable andor release toxic smoke.

In addition, the hotel is located above a restaurant  a potential source of ignition.

We understand that many hotels in Paris are like this, so if you value your personal safety you really need to check this aspect of any hotel before booking.

We have raised this matter with the hotel and pointed out that there are some lowcost options for allowing escape from upper rooms.  They have 'referred our issue to their management' but it remains to be seen if they will take action to improve the situation.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Les Appartements Paris Clichy.,"63 Bd Jean Jaurès, 92110 Clichy, France",4.2,48.9009752,2.3052457,"Great location. Convenient. Close to shops and public transport. Booked a 2bedroom apartment. Rooms were ok, but the place was generally falling apart. Many of the cabinet doors were off the hinges or only hanging on 1 hinge, toilet seat broken, ask in one shower gel bottle was for with water had to go buy our own the next day to have a shower, flush didn't work properly, shower is mouldy water flows slowly, so it smells, ceiling in bathroom mouldy. Couldn't turn on air conditioning, so requested for a fan. It was almost falling apart  could not even stand properly I have photos but can't seem to stay them. Living room standing light was also wobbly. Kitchen area was dark and the underlighting didn't work. Washer in the apartment had no dryer ended up going to a laundromat. Booked for 4 people on different itineraries, but only given 1 set of keys. We had to chase cur another and only got it on the 3rd day.  Maybe we just got a bad room. It was otherwise good value for money and a very convenient place to stay. Perfect Place and staff
We loved our unit! Clean and complete with all the things we need in the kitchen, bedroom and toilet. The staff were super helpful, Nikolai and Nadir. Super affordable and location is great. There are supermarket, pastry shops, restaurants which are just down the building. Its also near the park and taxi stand. We will definitely come back to this place! Only negative, if you even consider it negative is the late check in. Coming in from an international flight around 0700 we had to wait till 1500 for check in.
Staff was super courteous and expedited our apartment cleaning first.
So far Im super pleased with everything about this place.
Very spacious apartment fully supplied with cooking equipment.
Rooms clean and in good repairs. Spacious bathroom
right below the hotel is the supermarket.
12 block away is the bus stop and 1 12 blocks the metro.
Ample selection of food and groceries within a 2 block area. Pharmacy 12 block away
Traffic is a little crazy and people are always in a rush.  just like any big city

Took an Uber to the hotel from airport 85 one way so anticipate the cost We loved the size of the room.  Very close to Metro.  Fresh groceries daily from downstairs grocery store and great bakery across the street.  The park was perfect, we were able to have a charcuterie board and wine while kids played ball at the park.  Highly recommend this apartment.  Great value. It's ok, but clearly that are a lot of things that don't work correctly.

Taking a bath was a huge pain, because one had to constantly play with the handle of the water to get hot water, basically one had to close the water completely and then restart again to be able to take a bath with hot water.

Also it seems they didn't check the room completely before we arrived because no shampoo was available. Also the floor didn't seem to be that clean.

The personnel has very helpful and nice when I mentioned the hot water problem and the no shampoo available. No doubt about that.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Our room was beyond charming, although very tight. We loved breakfast every morning, my husband is gluten free and lactose free and they had special bread for him. The bed was super comfortable and the location great for walking, biking or taking the metro anywhere. It could get a little loud outside at night, but not bad at all. Great hotel for sure! Quintessential Paris experience in this small and luxurious boutique hotel. We loved our room with exposed beams lovely wallpaper cozy beds spacious bathroom and courtyard view quiet! we had quiet neighbouring rooms for our night I slept like a baby and my daughter too.  Lovely friendly welcome at the front desk. We loved it our stay will be back. We had a lovely time staying here and overall had great service and the rooms were very nice. Winnie at reception was very kind and helpful. Wonderful gem in a cozy village of Paris. Surrounded by fantastic restaurants and Parisian cafes. Staff super polite and helpful! The service was excellent.  The staff went overboard to help us much as possible. The rooms were small for the price we paid. The location is good for walking around and with excellent restaurants.

Hôtel L de Lutèce - Notre Dame,"65 Rue Saint-Louis en l'Île, 75004 Paris, France",4.5,48.85245150000001,2.3546609,"What a beautiful stay. We loved staying here so much. The location was so lovely and peaceful. It was like being in a quiet neighborhood in the middle of the city. The hotel was beautiful and clean. There is a great little sitting area in the lobby by a fireplace where teacoffee and snacks are served everyday. The staff was very sweet and the hotel was so clean. Lovely white linens and beautifully decorated rooms. The rooms and bathrooms were larger than expected for Paris. We stayed in the deluxe twin  adjoining rooms on the 2nd floor. We loved being able to open the large windows and let the breeze in. All the stores and restaurants we visited on the island were good and the staff very friendly. Locstion is very accessible to different areas of Paris. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris. I cannot say enough good things about this adorable boutique hotel! The location is absolutely perfect  its super close in proximity to everything Les Marais, Notre Dame, St. Germain. The Island of St. Luis is adorable and is quiet at night, which is must especially if youre staying on the second floor. The rooms are on the smaller side as are all rooms in Paris but they are really well decorated and outfitted with everything you need. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean. I recommend getting a bottle of wine from LEtiquette wine shop down the street and enjoying it along the Seine, which is just a few blocks over from the hotel. There is also delicious cafe next door called Noir, which serves the biggest variety and best lattes Ive encountered yet in Paris. I will stay here again the next time I travel to Paris for sure! Stayed here for a night as a couple and loved the experience very much. This is a small boutique hotel at the heart of Ile St Louis in a very centrally located, yet calm area. The rooms are designed with lot of charm and elegance. Complimentary tea and treats are offered for tea time in the lobby, which we've enjoyed by the old fireplace during a rainy afternoon. The staff were very friendly throughout our stay. Looking forward to returning soon! The hotel boasts an excellent location on St. Louis Island, nestled along the River Seine, right in the heart of Paris. Its proximity to both metro and bus stops, just a 5minute walk away, makes it incredibly convenient for exploring the city. Additionally, the island is home to a variety of fine dining options, adding to the appeal of the location.

While the hotel's amenities were somewhat basic, the junior suite we chose was impressively spacious, featuring two large windows that added to its charm.

In summary, our stay was quite satisfying. Considering the affordable rate we paid for such a generously sized room in central Paris, it felt like a great value for our money. The staff was very helpful.  We particularly enjoyed being greeted by Nanda in the breakfast room every morning, serving us wonderful pain du chocolate.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hotel Auteuil Tour Eiffel,"8-10 Rue Félicien David, 75016 Paris, France",4.1,48.850637,2.275293,"The staff were some of the nicest people we met while there, which didnt say much for the rest of the interactions. We were told we booked the reservation breakfast included upon check in. In the morning we proceeded to breakfast, then were asked to leave as we were making plates because it was not included. Embarrassing yes, but no big deal considering it was only a continental breakfast yet advertised as a hot breakfast. Definitely not worth the the additional charge.

We also booked a nonsmoking room which was pointless. The entire floor smelled like cigarettes daily, and we smelled it especially in the evening when people were smoking. I assumed they had nonsmoking floors, which apparently is unheard of. The location isnt bad, but expect a 1520 minute walk to public transportation. Also, the people in general are not nice despite how you approach or talk to them. Overall pass and not worth the price. Very comfortable beds, clean rooms, beautiful bathrooms and a very nice shower. The location is good, 25 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. A supermarket, and a nice bakery nearby. The staff are very friendly and attentive, especially the night receptionist and the bar waiter. We slept very well, a perfect stay in Paris. Of course I forgot to bring an adapter for my electronics while traveling in Europe, so the front desk let me borrow one. Great service. Bar dining laundryclose to the Eiffel Tower they have everything and they made my trip really comfortable. Out of the three nights we were in Paris, this was the best of the three hotels we stayed in. The room was spacious, modern and clean. The desk staff were very friendly and accomodating to their guests. Also, the price point was affordable given it is a 4star hotel The service was good. I was flying in from Southeast Asia. I had a long flight without sleep for 24 hours. They let us check in early. The room was cleaned up very nicely too.

Hôtel Ducs de Bourgogne,"19 Rue du Pont Neuf, 75001 Paris, France",4.6,48.86036499999999,2.344171,"Recently stayed at this hotel and felt compelled to leave a review. The staff was so kind, friendly, and helpful. We stayed in a superior room and while it was small, there was still room for all of our purchases. Daily Housekeeping also did a great job. Locationwise, this hotel was perfect for a first time visitor to Paris and was very accessible for flagging down a cab. Def recommend!! I traveled here with my mother and sister. My mother and I shared a junior suite and my sister used a deluxe single room. By American hotel chain standards the rooms may seem small but they met our needs for size, were charming and had many amenities.

Beds were very comfortable. Bathroom amenities were excellent. Service was very friendly. We were very well cared for! Breakfast was included for our stay and the buffet was lovely.

We've enjoyed every minute! Nestled in the heart of Paris, Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne is a true gem that exceeds expectations. From the moment I stepped inside, I was enveloped in an atmosphere of beauty and charm. Despite its modest size, the hotel exudes elegance and sophistication, with every detail meticulously curated to perfection.

The impeccable service provided by the staff further elevated my experience. Their warmth and attentiveness made me feel truly valued as a guest, and their dedication to ensuring my comfort and satisfaction was unparalleled.

Locationwise, Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne couldn't be better situated. Its prime position allowed me to easily explore the iconic landmarks and vibrant streets of Paris, making it the ideal base for my adventures in the city of lights.

What truly sets this hotel apart is the exceptional value it offers. Despite its high quality and luxurious ambiance, the price remains surprisingly reasonable, making it accessible to travelers seeking both luxury and affordability.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne enough. Whether you're visiting Paris for business or leisure, this hotel offers an experience that is nothing short of extraordinary. I am already looking forward to my next stay, and I am grateful to the hotel for providing me with such a memorable and delightful experience. Thank you for having me, Hotel Ducs de Bourgogne. Not sure how French rate their hotels but this hotel is FAR from 4 stars. I would give it 2 stars at most. I booked a year ago since I was planning to go to the Olympic. The hotel location is good and I read all the great reviews about this hotel so I decided to book it. The price was around 600 per night. For a 4 star hotel, I think this is an ok price. While I was booking the hotel, I specifically asked for higher floor and quiet room. I got email response from the hotel and saying they would try their best and its based on the availability. This is totally understandable. No communication after that. Mind that this was a year ago. When the day came and I finally arrived at the hotel, they gave me a tiny room on the second floor facing the street. I asked them to check my note and the staff said if you want higher floor facing the back, you should book the standard premium room. THIS WAS NEVER MENTIONED. I was under the impression that its based on availability. Had I was told I must booked a standard premium meaning even more expensive than 600 per night to get a higher floor and facing the back type of room, I would had booked that instead. The staff was extremely firm and kept saying impossible impossible to change room. I DID ASK TO CHANGE TO ANOTHER ROOM AND YOUR STAFF FIRMLY SAID IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HESITATION! You now replied saying you are fully booked for the Olympic which was what I booked it a year in advance for and paid the premium. I asked for a quiet room a year ago instead I got a ting room with bugs and facing the street!

Fine. I went to my room and was a completely shocked. For 600, it was extremely small. The room is a little small, but the location is very good, and the room is a little beautiful, but the quilt is a little itchy. The staff is very warm and polite, and they greet and smile warmly every day. Next time I go to Paris, I will choose to stay in this hotel again, but I hope the hygiene can be improved a little bit, and the quilt and sheets on the bed can be cleaner.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The rooms aren't large Room 15, but they're smartly designed, very wellappointed with everything you need, and the decor in the halls and rooms is gorgeous  like classic Paris! Breakfast was an excellent buffet with a lot of variety, and the staff was cheerful and very helpful from checkin to checkout. Cheers to the management and staff to run a firstrate hotel at affordable pricing! Cheers! Excellent! My favourite hotel in Paris. Amazing view, super clean and super comfortable.
Just 1,5km from tower Eiffel, so close! The location is amazing.
A perfect view in a charming room, I feel like Im in a movie in Paris. I really recommend, everything was perfect, including the staff that is super friendly.
Perfect if youre going as a couple, with kids, with family or friends. 1010, the best Ive stayed in Paris, and I travel all the time. I recently stayed at this hotel, and I was absolutely blown away by the stunning views. From the moment I entered the room, I couldnt take my eyes off the picturesque scenery outside the window. Whether it was the sunrise or sunset, every moment felt magical. Really nice property. Perfect central location near Metro. Extremely quiet neighborhood with several cafes and restaurant options. Terrific staff all friendly and helpful! say hi to Marie! Great breakfast for a fair price additional to room fee. AIrconditioned with a small fridge and safe in the room. Spotlessly clean. First choice when I return! Nice room with a view of the moon and Les Invalides! The place was in a convenient location near many great restaurants you MUST go to Le Florimond if you stay here! The bed however didnt have a top sheet just a bottom sheet and a very heavy duvet cover. Maybe this is a thing outside of the USA? After two nights of this we finally asked the desk for another sheet and they immediately sent one up to us. There was a very good breakfast in the morning with scrambled eggs, pastries, and fruit. Overall we had a very lovely stay here!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Duquesne Eiffel,"23 Av. Duquesne, 75007 Paris, France",4.3,48.8526534,2.3090792,"This hotel is small but charming. Although the room price is a bit expensive, but the view of the Eiffel tower was stunning from the balcony. Compared to other prices of hotels with an Eiffel Tower view, it is actually acceptable. The basement for breakfast is also a lovely and charming Frenchstyle place. The food was good, the staff were nice, and the room was small but clean and beautiful. Just one thing to be careful of the chair on the balcony was wet, so don't let the surface fool you  your pants will get wet when you sit on it. Hotel Duquesne Eiffel is situated in a prime location, just a short walk from the Eiffel Tower, making it a convenient spot for visitors who want to explore one of Paris' most iconic landmarks on foot. The surrounding neighborhood is charming and peaceful, with easy access to cafes, restaurants, and other key attractions in the city, which adds to its appeal.

Upon arrival, the receptionist was exceptionally welcoming and helpful, contributing to a pleasant checkin experience. The staff's warmth and attentiveness were definite highlights of the stay.

However, the rooms themselves left something to be desired. They were quite small and felt cramped, especially given the price. Despite being clean and wellmaintained, the limited space made it challenging to fully relax. Additionally, the view from our room was a bit underwhelming, as it faced the garden rather than the Eiffel Tower. We learned that only the superior rooms offer a view of the iconic monument, which might be worth considering for future stays if a breathtaking view is a priority. Perfect location  not too close to the Eiffel Tower that your among all the tourists but still only a 1015 minute walk.  There are also plenty of restaurantbars within 23 blocks of the hotel to keep you entertained.  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back.

The rooms are small but well organized the double standard bed was comfortable medium hardness mattress with two pillows.  the bathroom shower is adequate size and the water pressure is good with plenty of hot water on demand.

The elevator is tiny really tiny no more than 4 people would fit and there is only one but we never found it to be an issue at all.

The staff were friendly, courteous and genuine  very helpful with all our questions.

TIP order the prepay breakfast for the price it is worth it and there is good variety. I loved our two night stay here. Very friendly and helpful staff. It is a petit hotel narrow halls, stairs, cozy little room which I loved. If you are a large person you may find the space, especially bathroom, too small. Our room was cool and clean and charming. Eiffel Tower in walking distance, but not extremely close easy access to metro and buses. My review of the establishment doesn't reflect the staff as everyone we came across was extremely friendly. However, the establishment is described as a hotel which is a stretch it is more a motel. The price charged for a night for a view of the Eiffel Tower and the quality of the rooms provided are not worth the price at all. The hotel is not well kept and there are stains on the carpet on the hallways including the room as well. The furniture is worn and scratched and the room reeked of cigarettes. The tub had stains and I didn't even bother taking a shower or sleeping there. The only great thing was the view of the tower however I feel like you can find a different location that would offer the same view who value cleanliness.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Aparthotel Adagio Access Paris Porte de Charenton,"203 Rue de Paris, 94220 Charenton-le-Pont, France",3.8,48.8292086,2.4012304,"We stayed 4 nights with a baby 1 year old so I will review the baby facilities for other parents. We were provided with a cot in our room, but the cot didnt have a proper mattress. An adult bedsheet had just been wrapped around the thin base of the cot which was hard for baby to sleep on. It also meant the base of the cot was very low down and difficult to lower a sleeping baby into it.
When we asked at the reception they also provided us a high chair which made mealtimes much easier.
There were some toys downstairs which would have been good but they weren't very well maintained, missing pieces etc. The books were all for older children, nothing for babiestoddlers.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and thought the room was reasonable for the price paid. We could see the Eiffel tower from our window which was nice  We booked 2 bedroom apartment. The location only 5 mins from metro. Nice reception area provide free tea and coffee, toys and games for children. Staffs are very friendly and allowed us early check in. We had a lovely time in Paris. Stayed during the Paris Olympics, lovely location felt very safe and friendly. The area the apartments were located was perfect and only a few minutes walk away from the metro. One downside was there is no airconditioning a fan was provided but with temperatures of near 30C the fan didn't really provide much relief but apart from that we had a really great stay. If you are driving to Paris, this hotel is an excellent choice.  The staff were excellent, welcoming and very hepful.  The hotel is well situated.  Easy access from the Peripherique, on the edge of the Bois de Vincennes  a beautiful park with dedicated cycling circuit.  Good transport links into central Paris and close to Bercy.  Spacious, practical apartment.  Would definitely recommend and book again. A fairly standard place to stay.
The wardrobe seemed a bit shoddy.

There was only one power socket and shelf at the side of the bed. Nothing the other side. Everywhere else I've been there's been power sockets on both sides of the bed. Also the one socket by the bed didn't work so everything had to be plugged into the socket by the TV, the other side of the room.
If power sockets aren't going to be readily available where they would naturally be regularly used, maybe the hotel should consider allowing residents to borrow extension cables
There was evidence of where a shelf used to be the other side of the bed  seemed like it had been ripped off but it looks like instead of it being replaced, they just covered the area in a laminate that didn't match the rest of the area.
Even thought the room came with a mini kitchen there was no room for any prep work.
There was no way of reaching the socket for the microwave so the room was lit up my a Christmas tree every night from the microwaves display.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hôtel Fougère,"36 Rue Bonaparte, 75006 Paris, France",4.7,48.8550769,2.3336882,"I adore this hotel.

Its a small cozy hotel with a great location. The interior design is just perfect.  Whenever I walk in after a long flight I am welcomed so warmly. The breakfast is delicious. The rooms are lovely and the beds so comfortable its hard to get out in the morning but Paris is outside. The rooms are on the smaller side but that is normal in Paris for boutique hotels. the rooms had a few personal touches. There where tiny sweets an a water bottle carrier. Staff was really nice and hotel had warm vibe. Also, was great location for walking to many sites. Stayed for 2 nights and have to say the hotel made Paris such a delight. Excellent service, positively cozy room,  excellent location. The receptionsconcierge team are all lovely  if im going back to Paris, this is the hotel I will stay in. The hotel is magnificent. The location is perfect. Off the main streets so it felt so quaint and quiet. The service was impeccable. Every detail handled perfectly. The team who served us was simply outstanding  gracious, helpful, patient. Beautiful hotel  incredibly service. It was also a great location, easy to get to the Metro or just walk around.

Minor constructive feedback is for the staff to include a written note about needing to leave the room key with the front desk when you leave the building to avoid any frustrations on either parties part.

Anytime I'm in Paris, I'll be staying here. Thank you!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Paris Lafayette Hotel,"23 Rue des Messageries, 75010 Paris, France",3.8,48.87642059999999,2.348894999999999,"Lovely staff. Neat, clean rooms with just what you need and nothing else. Air conditionerfan is very nice and quiet. Wonderful location. Pathetic hotel with very rude and inhumane staff. We were given a room with no air conditioning. Here on a work trip so only needed a place to crash and sleep peacefully at the end of a hectic day but thats not possible.
We raised multiple complaints but every time have been asked to wait for the manager who is never available on duty and doesnt bother replying to emails. The front desk refused to call them and said its not a big enough issue to  call him.
Finally the manager responded and said he will look into the issue tomorrow with a remark that its not that hot in Paris! All in all, was great for the price. Very basic bit comfortable enough to use as a base to explore Paris.
The rooms are compact but the bed was comfortable. Room had ac too. Staff were friendly too. Very clean and close to the metro station. There are great places to eat nearby. It was really good value for money. We needed a room to sleep in only since we were out exploring all day and this hotel was perfect for that. The room was very small, and unfortunately, the lift was out of order when I stayed, and I dropped my luggage down the stairs and also nearly fell down the stairs. Having said that, I would stay again. The service was fantastic, and they went over and above the mark. The location was great for food, but so far away from tourist spots.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Millesime Hôtel Paris,"15 Rue Jacob, 75006 Paris, France",4.8,48.85504290000001,2.3350443,"The staff was very kind and the location is great. But unfortunately the room and general state of the hotel were dissapointing the furniture looks low quality, the interior design feels very cold, the common areas could use some maintenance, the room smelled of smoke,  the bathroom made noises all night. For 500 a night there are definitely better choices and I would not classify this place as a boutique hotel. My wife and stayed at this hotel for six nights recently.  Overall, our stay was lovely  location, staff, and accommodations were wonderful.

The hotel itself is very nice, clean, and updated.  We had breakfast most mornings, which provided nice options and the quality of food items you'd expect in Europe.  Location was great, with many things within walking distance yet not on a busy street.  It's a small hotel, so you avoid the hustle and bustle of a large tourist hotel chain.

Our room was nice sized again, remember this is Paris, had all the amenities you'd expect, and was very clean.  Only downside was some noise from people walking home from the bars at night, but this is to be expected in a metro area and the disruption was minimal.

The best part of our stay was the welcoming and accommodating staff.  They were attentive during checkin, helping us get our bearings in the city, and make sure we didn't have any questions.  Little touches like being greeted every time we walked by the front desk, the knowledgeable and helpful concierge, and friendly people made us feel like home.

Will definitely come stay again the next time we're in Paris.  Au revior! We loved our family roomloft. It was clean, comfortable and had nice views of the Latin Quarter. Its a small and quaint hotel in a perfect location of Paris. Very nice and we would definitely return. We hope to. Thanks! We just spent 5 nights at Hotel Millesime and it was lovely.
A special thank you to Erik, Damien and Jean at the front desk who offered suggestions, booked us a table our first day and made sure we were heading the right direction when we ventured out.
The location is ideal for walking. There are loads of shops and cafes within minutes of walking and several Metro stations.
The staff offered guidance for the metro tofrom the airport which was very easy and far less expensive than Uber.
I lost a favorite earring in the room and the cleaning person found it and placed it on the table for me.
The breakfast had a nice selection including scrambled eggs, meats, fruit, bread and cheeses. It was enough to get us started.
The room was clean and well supplied. Our room faced the street and we did hear some late night revelers coming home from the bars a bit tipsy, singing songs from the street below. We found it funny. It lasted a few minutes. Otherwise it was quiet and we slept well.
The hotel was painting the hallway during our stay which didn't bother us at all. Painters were quiet.
Paris in Feb. is a mix of cool, rain and moments of sun. The hotel supplies umbrellas which was helpful.
I would definitely stay there again. Thank you for a lovely stay! We stayed for one night.  We were kindly given access to the room early since arrived at 9AM.  The staff were kind and helpful.  Our room was fine however, they were painting on our floor and it smelled of paint.  There was plastic on the rug as well.  I would have chosen another place if I had known this in advance.  The room was okay.  The bed was comfortable.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel R de Paris - Boutique Hotel,"41 Rue de Clichy, 75009 Paris, France",4.6,48.879942,2.329001,"Really like this hotel.   The front lobby staff are super friendly and helpful.  The room is very clean and functional and cleaning staff clean the room each day and refill toiletries without asking.  There is 4pm daily free snack each day.   Breakfast is 19 euro with quality food.   The location is central close to shopping such as Galeries Lafayette and Printemps and close to subway to go to other districts.  Lastly and very important, each room has double double yes two layers of double window pane so it is very quiet for sleeping.  If you like old fashioned hotel comfort and hospitality, this is the place to be.  we stayed here twice this year and will definitely book it next time when we come. Terrible value money hotel. Advertised as a 4 star but Hamam was not working and they charge for the sauna. Would never stay again, disappointed with the ripoff. Very nice hotel with great proximity to the metro station.It is clean and nice with the option to add breakfast prior or on arrival for as many days as you want. Very nice people at the front desk especially the evening guy. I had a lovely time staying at this hotel. I interacted with the staff several times. Each time they were very polite, accommodating, and respectful. I was able to check out late at no additional fee which was very helpful seeing as I had a later flight and a lot of work to do. The rooms were very clean and quiet despite some minor construction going on at the hotel. I had the morning breakfast one day which was very delicious and reasonable. The hotel is walking distance to a lot of great restaurants, attractions, and very safe. I would stay here again. Stayed in one of their top floor rooms. It was nice and quiet, I had a nice sleep. Rooms are nice and they have all the basics. The top floor room also had a skyline which was quite good","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel les Jardins du Luxembourg,"5 Imp. Royer-Collard, 75005 Paris, France",4.6,48.8455643,2.3409188,"This hotel is absolutely perfect.
The location is amazing the hotel is located down a very quiet street but in the centre still with the gardens being a 3 minute walk.

The staff were impeccably helpful Bruce and Gregory  couldnt be any better.

Rooms were clean and tidy and very well done they look very new.

Overall I couldnt recommend enough we loved it. Rooms are very nice but small. Very quiet. Very friendly staff. Location is perfect with access to Latin Quarter, Luxembourg Gardens, and CDG Loved loved loved this hotel. Super charming! Rooms were spacious and clean. In a perfect area, very walkable. Highly recommend!! I would give this hotel 6 stars if I could
Our second stay was just as lovely as the first one. I wouldnt think of booking other hotel while in Paris, this will definitely become my regular.
We stayed with our 7 years old daughter and the room was so spacious especially in comparison to other Paris hotels where family rooms are a rare find. It even has a separating door.
The location couldnt be more perfect because it is 3 minutes from Luxemburg park where there are lots of activities for kids and the park itself is beautiful.
The staff at the reception so welcoming and professional one of them did everything he could to help us with last minute dinner reservation which turned to be a perfect French restaurant experience. Thank you for that!
Like others mentioned  close to the Pantheon, Sorbonne University and great boulangeries the staff has great recommendation list! and of course the direct RER line to Airport just a few meters away.
Cant wait to get back. This was my first time staying at this lovely boutique hotel.  My room was nicely decorated and comfortable and the staff professional and helpful.  The location, one street over from the Luxembourg Gardens and the Pantheon, was ideal.  I would definitely stay here again.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Caron de Beaumarchais Paris Marais,"12 Rue Vieille du Temple, 75004 Paris, France",4.6,48.8564631,2.356855,"Right from the start, hotel service was extremely helpful and kind to us.

Before we even arrived, we accidentally booked the wrong dates of our stay and the management worked out a solution with us that we felt was fair.

Upon arrival, we left our cellphone in the taxi when we were dropped off at the hotel. Within minutes, Etienne jumped into action and ran down the street with me as we tracked the phone. Long story short, we got the phone back, but point being, we were totally impressed at his speed of trying to help us retrieve our phone.

The service desk had someone manning it 247. The main door was always locked, so security was never a worry. They greeted us every time we came to or went from the hotel. They genuinely cared and asked us how our day was and what we had seen on our journey. Even the housekeeping staff was a pleasure to speak with.

The room was made up for us EVERY day. It was great to know we had a comfortable bed made up for us to come back to after a long day exploring Paris. We never worried about the amount of towels, soaps, toilet paper they were replaced daily.

We highly recommend the balcony room, as we sat out daily to people watch morning and nightly. It was a perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine and cheese after a day of exploring the city. A friend recommended this hotel, and we were more than satisfied with the location, service, and the cute decor.

Right from arrival, reception was super welcoming and friendly. This was after we'd had a bad experience with the cabbie from the airport demanding extra money and dropping us 1km away from our destination. A big thank you to Genevieve for making us feel so welcome!! In fact, all the staff were very friendly, and they have 247 Concierge to look after the room keys and front door.

The great location means you can walk to most places, though Paris is large, so we average 20k steps daily walking everywhere. You really need to catch the bus or metro if going to the Louvre or Montmatre.

The breakfast is amazing, as you can see from the photos. Essentially buffet quality and volume.

We will definitely be returning to this lovely cute hotel in future!  I booked this hotel for my partners birthday.  I had never been to Paris before!  We loved the location of this hotel and its ease of access to so many cafes and restaurants and shops all within minutes walking distance.  The hotel in itself feels like you have stepped back in time and is very cute.  We loved the style, and the staff are all so friendly and helpful.  We would love to return again and would not hesitate to stay here again.  Loved it. This is a gorgeous, authentic, vintage, boutique hotel, located so conveniently in Marais. The reception team are very obliging and helpful. Perfect for wandering the streets, enjoying coffee, restaurants, shopping and soaking up the history of Marais and greater Paris. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Merci  My sister and I stayed here and it was so lovely. The nicest staff and an amazing breakfast! When notre dame is open, it will be perfect for that. Wish the beds were more comfortable but the staff made up for it!","Monday: 1:00 AM – 12:00 AM

HOTEL ARAMIS SAINT GERMAIN Best Western,"124 Rue de Rennes, 75006 Paris, France",4.3,48.8467429,2.326486,"We just stayed here two weeks ago. I was picking my daughter up from a year of exchange in France and we needed somewhere to store her suitcases while we traveled in Europe. Since we were ending our trip in Paris and staying here a few nights, I inquired about luggage storage, and they kept her bags at no charge. This is a great location with the 4 train right across the street, we were able to easily get to attractions. There was a great bakery right around the corner where we got fresh baguette and croissant. Right next to that was a little store with fresh produce and cheese. There was a small fridge in the room to keep things cold. The room was very clean and comfortable. The air conditioning worked great. I thought I had booked a room with a balcony, but while they were checking us in, I asked and they were about to put us in a room without one. They were able to switch us, which we appreciated. We really enjoyed the balcony, it was very small, but added to the Paris experience. Also the windows were pretty sound proof, and we didn't really hear the noise from the street. Our room had a tub, which I loved, but if you are someone with mobility issues you may want to inquire about a shower. It was tricky to get in and out of because of the glass door. The staff was great, highly recommend. Great location! We booked a superior room for the extra space. The room was clean, AC worked. We had a balcony and the beds were comfortable. Nice safe neighborhood for me and daughter traveling on our own. Breakfast did not disappoint. Much better than my expectations. Staff were very kind and helpful, room was clean and comfy. Had breakfast just once there, it was satisfying to say the least. And hotel's location is perfect for use of public transportation. It was overall a pleasant experience. Great location, metrobus close. Room clean, very adequate for our needs. Did not get the breakfast service. Wonderful small balcony on 5th floor. Perfect for morning coffee, evening beer! AC, small elevator a plus. This hotel is located in the right spot in front of a metro station, caf, bars and restaurants. It's a small, elegant, clean hotel in the middle of a beautiful city. The customer service at the front desk was very good. Wifi worked flawlessly all the time.  I will say that this is a small hotel and rooms are small therefore would recommend to stay in a higher class room even if you have to pay a little more. Did not use the breakfast area.","Monday: Open 24 hours

They respond immediately to all requests. The bed is king size and very comfortable. The security is excellent. You go through 3 locked doors before you get to your apartment. Its very quiet and peaceful.
There are 2 metro station within a few blocks. The neighborhood is safe and you can walk to the Seine. The breakfast basket is filled with a variety of amazingly delicious food. Safe, clean and comfortable! Just few mins walk from Gare De Lyon and you can easily runwalkmetro to all the places you need to go in Paris. Kind owners with basket breakfast is a charm! I really love it. Camparis  is a great B  B

We have been coming to Paris for 4 years and always stay at Camparis.

Having our room at Camparis was the perfect place to spend time when we were not out enjoying your beautiful city.  A maid comes every day to clean the room and take care of any needs.

We would come to Paris just to have you daily breakfasts! Eanjo will modify the breakfast which comes daily at 800 pm in a cute basket outside your door.

Eanjo, the owner is easy to contact and will make suggestions for you or help with anything. She also made reservation for you at restaurants.

The location in the Bastille area and the Metro and different bus lines are close as well as Gare de Lyon. A very safe part of the city

Stphane, her husband, will help you if she is not available which is very unusual. We have been staying at CamParis for many years and have never had any issues.  The owners are very accommodating, and the rooms are quiet and very comfortable.  We like having the kitchenette in Room N I believe Room O has a kitchenette as well, but we also enjoy the delicious breakfast basket delivered to our room each morning.  We would definitely stay at CamParis again. Hands down the best experience I had in Paris. Location is fantastic with a 5minute walk from Gare de Lyon, food is the best I had during the two weeks in Europe. The staff is also eager to offer tips and tricks around Paris, so I would definitely recommend this particular BnB for anyone.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The neighbourhood has plenty of options for food and several metro stations near by. Everything was super clean and beds were done every day. Mathieu, the host, was very helpful and efficient. Breakfast was served every morning including croissants, bread, butter, milk, coffee, cheese, juice and jam. Very recommended. Spacious and clean room in a good location! Matthieu, the property owner was very nice and helpful. Bed and room were done every morning after we left and breakfast was very good and fresh, especially the baguette and French pastries! Very close to metro station and a good number of restaurants to choose from in the area. Matthieu even stored our luggage after check out as we had a late flight. The only thing that could be better was wifi because it was quite slow and ended up using mobile data however this wouldn't stop us from visiting again! Lovely neighbourhood with closeby local good French restaurants, good communication and practical help from BB owner beforehand and during our stay, handy small and clean appartment, good breakfast with regards to 'French' standards Matthieu was friendly and efficient, even finding a travel power adapter for our phone chargers. He provided tasty French breakfast. Rooms were clean and location was great for exploring Paris on foot or by Metro. We stayed at this cozy hotel for four days. My family really appreciated Mat's hospitality. The room was clean when we got there and every day after. The shower was even better after a long day of adventure, refresh and get some rest for the next day. We are a family of four, and though we were used to bigger space, we were content. It didnt have a TV, but brought our laptop which helped. Internet was a bit rusty but were still able to watch movies from our laptop. The kitchen was the tiniest Ive ever seen, but perfect for our stay and the breakfast we were provided every morning. The breakfast was delicious and gotten better ever day. My kid's highlight before we go off on our adventure. The information book in the room was great. The metro, bus, and restaurant information was legit. I recommend this place to anyone if you want to just use the place for sleep and relax during your adventure. Everytime we get to the hotel at the end of the day from all our adventure, all we did was refresh and rest for the next day, so it was perfect for our family of four.

Citadines Les Halles Paris,"4 Rue des Innocents, 75001 Paris, France",4.0,48.8607013,2.3469937,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Paris for a short stay, and I was quite impressed with my accommodations. Although the room was not particularly spacious, it was meticulously clean, wellorganized, and provided a comfortable environment that far exceeded my expectations. Despite being located near a bustling street, the room was remarkably quiet, allowing for a peaceful and restful experience.

The bed deserves special mention for its exceptional comfort I slept deeply and woke up feeling refreshed each morning. This level of comfort significantly enhanced my overall experience. Furthermore, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the reception team, whose professionalism and attentiveness were evident throughout my stay. Their warm hospitality and commitment to excellent service made my visit all the more enjoyable. We stayed here for 2 nights only but it was wonderful. Location is quite good, easy to get to Louvre and many other touristy spots. And I also enjoyed the famous bakery in front of the hotel every morning, the breads I have tried were all good. And there was a pretty huge mall behind the hotel which has good supermarket. The room was nicely renovated and the staffs were all good. But it was a little noisy outside at night. When we checked in it was busy, as such we were not given any information about towels or supplies.

Both elevators were broken, as as result we were told we had to carry our bags up 7 flights of stairs.  I asked if we were able to get assistance and was told no it wasn't possible.... sprained ankle and all.

The shower head is terrible, you can't wash your hair with the large shower head as the water sprays in all directions and without much pressure.

We didn't find out until the 3rd day that we were able to get towels and toilet paper as they only give you one roll from the 1st floor supply room.  Another guest was getting in the lift with towels and toilet paper so asked them about it.  This would have been helpful to know when we checked in.

The fire alarm went off during our visit early one morning, the air conditioning in our room didn't work properly kept thowing errors and the power went off for a few minutes 20 minutes before we checked out.... I was grateful it came back on as I didn't want to have to lug our bags back down the 7 flights of stairs.

For the 4 day stay one elevator was broken the whole time, despite a sign saying it was going to be fixed and working the next morning at 7am....  The second elevator went out of order twice that I know of during our stay.

The location was fantasitc, this is what boosts my review. We were disappointed with the service received, your rooms werent cleaned and you have to go and get your own fresh sheets and towels everyday from the laundry everyday as they didnt offer daily cleaningbed making. We arrived at 4pm and our rooms still werent ready when we were told we strictly had to be out by 11am on the day we were leaving. Both of the lifts were out of order and on the day we were leaving we had to take all of our suitcases down the stairs and no staff tried to help us. We werent impressed with the service at all. Starting with the positives, the rooms are modern, clean and generally speaking well appointed. The quality of the bedding was noticeably better than what I'd have expected from a midscale property.  The beds were very comfortable  firm mattresses that actually supports your back with soft mattress toppers an absolute win there. The location is super handy with walking distance to all major tourist attractions, great eateries and the Les Halles Chattelet station that is serviced by all major train metro routes in Paris. The staff were terribly inconsistent, but the couple of the nicer ones were really helpful. To the not so great now, the air conditioners are awfully underpowered. To add to the problem, the property has locked the operations of the unit so the minimum the temperature goes down to is 22. When the room ambient temperature hits that, the AC automatically stops operation, no, not just the cooling, it entirely shuts down, even the ventilation. I was unfortunately feeling stuffy in the room during much of my stay. I talked to the front desk and tried to have it resolved on my first day, but it was apparent the guy who looked at it had no clue and the front desk staff member made me feel like I was being a burden to him! The sound proofing within the building is almost non existent  you hear whatever is happening on the corridor, the next room as if it is unfolding right next to you. On my first day of arrival, at mid night, the fire alarm of the whole building was going on for a good 10  15 minutes. People were climbing down stairs quietly literally in their Pjs carrying toddlers. The front desk dude never apologised, not a single time, and for the whole time was just uttering 'it's a false alarm' with the shtiest attitude imaginable the same guys who I talked to about the AC. On my day of departure the lifts had gone out of order and the front desk staff was really apologetic about it. I also had to change my room mid stay due to some noisy neighbours the request was accommodated swiftly with no issues. So it seems like rather than bad service across the board,  it's just terribly inconsistent. While circa 300 euros night is not ludicrously expensive for Paris, it most definitely is not cheap either. I'd have expected the basics like sound proofing and functioning ACs to be a given at this mid range price point. I unfortunately would not be returning or recommend.",no operation time,"city_hall, lodging, local_government_office, point_of_interest, establishment"

From the front desk to the wait staff in the restaurant.  Nothing seems too much trouble. Everything is handled so smoothly and with a certain kindness that is appreciated.
Always a great pleasure to stay. A very fine hotel in a very fine neighborhood in Paris St Germain. Highly recommended for couples visiting Paris. Easy access to Metro and easy to walk to the Sienne. Great staff. Sarah, Victor and others made our stay special. From the welcome bottle of champagne and the chocolates, to the special birthday gift with a card signed by all the staff.  You really feel at home in Paris. A great boutique hotel in the Saint Germain district.  Easy access to the metro and sights of Paris as well as shopping and restaurants.  The staff here were the stars of our experience, they were incredibly kind and attentive to our questions and requests.   When we return to Paris, this will be our first choice to book another stay.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Sourire Boutique Hotel Particulier,"29 Rue des Marronniers, 75016 Paris, France",4.8,48.8550304,2.2755282,"Incredibly charming and wonderful hotel! The hosts are so warm and welcoming. Our room was very comfortable. Our young son was very welcome and had an amazing time. The rooftop terrace is stunning oasis! We had an absolutely wonderful time! This place was truly magical. From the moment we stepped through the doors, we were enchanted by its charm. The hotel owners created an atmosphere that felt like something out of a fairytale. With its picturesque location, cozy rooms, and delicious breakfasts, this hotel became more than just accommodationit became a magical retreat that we'll always remember fondly. great place for my trip! very beautiful, spacious. delicious breakfasts with freshly baked croissants every day. and wonderful friendly staff. I walked 30 minutes to the Eiffel Tower, 1 hour to the Louvre and the Orsay Museum. I would come back here with pleasure! The most beautiful and elegant boutique hotel in Paris.  The most welcoming and helpful hosts.  The rooftop garden breakfasts were wonderful and an evening drink in the garden or greenhouse salon even better.  You are just a few blocks from the Seine and a 20 minute walk from Roland Garros, which was lucky for us as we got stranded with no public transport at 130a after the night match. You become part of the real Paris at this hotel  truly a memorable stay.   We cannot wait to return!! The Sourire Boutique was the perfect location for our reception, the hotel has a beautiful decor, the patio is amazing and it was spacious enough to have a wonderful night of dancing. The service and response times were impeccable and the hosts were flexible to every one of our needs, from dietary restricitons to adding guests they were amazing. If you are looking for a location that will allow you to spend time with your guests, dance, and have great service. Then we cannot reccomend this location enough. The Boheme suite is the perfect way to end the wedding night, tailored with breakfast in the morning. Worth every cent!","Monday: Open 24 hours

To me the room had the essence Paris. The staff spoke English, amongst other languages. I would return and highly recommend.

I remembered the communication was fantastic, they sent emails on how to get there with the types of transport and advised on how not to get ripped of which was very accurate. They can also arrange pick up. They replied quickly, were so helpful. Honestly if this is your first time and you dont speak French I highly recommend Fabulous apartment in a great location. The epitome of Paris charm  architecture. Our windows opened overlooking the street  neighbourhood. Very comfortable, clean  spacious room with all the mod cons of home. The washing machine, dishwasher  separate toilet to bathroom were a bonus. Staff were very helpful with the room or local questions. Convenient to popular sites, gourmet restaurants, supermarkets  the metro. Highly recommend. What a wonderful apartment. A family of 4 stayed at 45AS  42. It has everything a traveler needs. Very clean and in extremely convenient location. We definitely recommend it and it will be for sure our first choice in our next trip. Lovely Apartment in Paris.

Jules & Jim,"11 Rue des Gravilliers, 75003 Paris, France",4.7,48.86353330000001,2.3573722,"We are a family of three mom, dad, 12yearold. We got the suite that can accommodate three. It was wonderful. The room was exceptionally clean, and we had everything we needed. It isn't exactly spacious, but we had enough space to be comfortable.

The breakfast was very nice, to be able to go down and eat before having to be completely prepared for a day out. We would eat and then go back to our room to get ready for the day. The food was very good, with a selection of meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, fruit, cereal, and yogurt, with coffee and juice.

Every single employee we interacted with was stellar. From the daytime and nighttime reception agents, to the bartender, to the lady who ran the breakfast. They were all wonderful, polite, and accommodating.

We will definitely return. Our experience at Hotel Jules  Jim was superb. Absoluetly amazing Boutique Hotel. Everything very well thoughtought. The room was beautiful furnished, nice lighting and the rain shower was perfect. I felt very safe  cozy. Rooms are so quiet. Extremely friendly service 247 and the bar and breakfast area so arty and pretty. Fresh orange and grapefruit juice and the egg was on point I loved the beautiful photos everywhere and that you documented the renovation of this place in such a unique way. Thank you so much  see you next Fashion Week. Beautiful hotel in a great neighbourhood. Room was fabulous and bed was so comfortable.

The bar and terrace areas are both so nice and perfect for a drink after a big day exploring Paris, or breakfast before getting the day started.

The staff are so lovely and very accommodating, have all the best recommendations for restaurants, cafes, and mustdos in the area.

Highly recommend this hotel, we hope to be back soon!!! Fantastic place! We were absolutely delighted with our say. The room was huge compared to anything we had stayed in in Paris previously. The staff were lovely. The gym had top of the range machines Beautifully designed boutique hotel with great bar and excellent location. Friendly staff.

Hotel des Deux Continents,"25 Rue Jacob, 75006 Paris, France",4.2,48.85528410000001,2.3344569,"I had a wonderful stay at Hotel des Deux Continents! The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We had originally booked a different room, but thanks to their flexibility and kindness, we were able to get a fixed room that was perfect for us.

The location of the hotel is simply unbeatable  right in the heart of Paris and just a short walk from many attractions. It was so easy to explore the city, and we loved soaking in the wonderful atmosphere of the neighborhood every morning.

The hotel exudes typical Parisian charm, with elegant decor and a cozy ambiance that made us feel right at home. Another highlight was the cleanliness of the rooms. Everything was spotless and wellmaintained, which made our stay even more pleasant. The breakfast was also fantastic, with a great variety of delicious options to start the day off right.

I can only warmly recommend this hotel and look forward to my next visit! I have stayed at this lovely, welcoming ""home away from home"" twice now, and each time the staff have made the experience outstanding.  From the moment you walk in and are greeted by Khalil and Erika, always enthusiastic and kind, you feel that you are in a family environment.  Everyone in the hotel, including the cleaning staff, work hard to make your experience special, and that will take me back again and again. The rooms are wellappointed and very clean. The wonderful smell of croissants comes up into my room early in the morning.  I can't say enough about this hotel, but most importantly, the people who work there who make a hotel, a home. This hotel deserves more than a compliment or two 
What an exceptional hotel delivering service par excellence !
Being ideally situated, its a mere stones throw away from the Louvre just across the Seine river.
24 hour concierge available with the most friendly  helpful available at all times.

Special thanks to Erika, Candice  Khalid for having made my stay unforgettable! Even having assisted by receiving clothing items on my behalf prior to my arrival.
This hotel has offered excellent value for money.

Many many thanks for your kindness 

We will definitely stay in touch. Nestled and tucked away in the 6th St. Germain, this great hotel was welcoming, well located with great staff. If you have visited almost anywhere in Europe, the rooms are small nothing new to report but it was incredibly comfortable. The breakfast which you need to add on was perfect. Highly recommend this great hotel in a great city!! We loved our stay at Hotel des Deux Continents. Lovely little cosy hotel with really friendly staff all around the clock.

La Réserve,"42 Av. Gabriel, 75008 Paris, France",4.7,48.8697628,2.3132848,"La Rserve is absolutely heavenly! My partner and I had the opportunity to finally stay at this wonderful property last month and wish we had more time to experience their little getaway from the craziness of the city.

Everyone was so lovely! All the staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and ensure you are well taken care of.

As a Travel Advisor, Im also very aware of the detail that goes into these properties and La Rserve definitely did not disappoint. They really want to ensure that they are tailoring your stay  all the way down to the desired temperature of your room!

If youre looking for a quiet stay, in a prime location and want to feel like youre heading home to your Parisian residence  this is the place to be! I stayed at Hotel La Rserve in Paris in 2022, and it was an exceptional experience. The luxurious atmosphere and attention to detail truly set this hotel apart. The staff were incredibly attentive and made sure every need was met, enhancing my stay in the heart of Paris. The rooms are elegantly designed with a blend of classic and modern elements, providing both comfort and style. I highly recommend trying the breakfastit's a gourmet delight with a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower. For a truly memorable visit, make use of the concierge service to discover hidden gems in the city. Whether you're on a romantic getaway or a business trip, Hotel La Rserve offers unparalleled elegance and service that will make your stay unforgettable. After staying twice for multiple days the only thing I could possibly complain about is a slightly under ripe avocado at breakfast. Service is the closest thing youll get to perfect.

Edit I have to give them credit. They saw my review and delivered a perfect avocado the next morning at breakfast with an apology from the chef. We enjoyed one round of drinks in the bar before our lunch booked with the 2 Michelin starred restaurant inside this hotel.

The bar manager Barbara was friendly and helpful. She made a delicious French 75 cocktail and the bar snacks were delicious as well. Beautiful bar with great interiors. Are at the restaurant. The service was super and food was awesome.

Seated at the bar which was more intimate than the large dining room. A good idea if you are speaking about sensitive subjects.","Monday: Open 24 hours

All the staff are absolutely fantastic and extremely helpful with whatever you may need , including the cleaning staff who are always smiling and very friendly. Our room is really nice and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent
When we come back to Paris, we will definitely be staying here again . We loved it here.
Thanks so much.
Garry  Lu Super friendly welcome and impeccable service throughout our short stay. The room was comfy and spotless. The breakfast had such a broad selection of good quality produce and something all tastes. The ambience is chilled and friendly and the team clearly work hard to provide their guests a nice stay. Will definitely stay here again. My partner and I had a wonderful fournight stay at Le Gnral. The front desk staff were super friendly and helpful with checkin and in offering us advice about our stay. We found the location very practical for its proximity to Republique, and the rooms were really quiet despite the central location. The bed in our room was big and very comfortable, and the coffee machine in the room was such a nice touch. We didn't try the breakfast so can't report back on that. We'll be back  Yes the location is great. The rooms are clean and very well decorated I was in love  with the art picture in our room. However the best part of this hotel is the crew. They are super helpful, very friendly  one of the best hotel crew I have ever seen Ibrahim thanks a lot for everything . They always make you feel welcomed. Great customer experience.  It will be our only address in Paris  We started our honeymoon here two weeks before the Olympics. The staff were so helpful and worked hard to make our stay memorable. We reached out a month before our stay and Ekaterina took the time to send over a long, detailed itinerary of places to see, eat and party. The hotel is perfectly located by the metro and surrounded by great restaurants. We also had a room with an incredible view.","Monday: Open 24 hours

There are not a lot of things around the hotel, but it does have few cafes, small restaurants and supermarket.
The service is quite good and everyone is kind. However, the cleaning is very lacking. The rooms are very old. And the biggest problem is that it inside your room you hear everything in the rooms beside you and we never suffer from that. The room was fairly clean, but the bathroom was super tiny.
The pillows were very uncomfortable, and you could hear Everything going on in the next rooms..
Location is right next to a huge metro station to take you anywhere you need. Amazing location. Wonderful, kind staff. I was traveling with a 6 yr old and they were lovey. It was so easy to get around the city. Breakfast was delicious and ample in including plenty nonbread protein options. I would return! I greatly enjoyed my stay at this charming, familyrun hotel located near Nation, a pleasant, residential neighborhood near several metro lines, with lots of restaurants, bakeries and shops.
My room, while small, was well appointed, clean and pleasant, with French windows opening onto a quiet courtyard. The hotel staff was lovely, very friendly and helpful. The only drawback was the handheld shower in the bathroom, which is actually very environmentally friendly since one tends to take short showers.
I highly recommend this hotel and would love to come back!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Maison Albar - Le Champs-Elysées,"3 Av. Mac-Mahon, 75017 Paris, France",4.3,48.875466,2.294527,"I visited this hotel in August. The staff was extremely kind and welcoming and my Room was very nice and clean. I will definitely be returning!! Staying at Maison Albar makes me want to go back to Paris ! We picked this hotel for our weekend getaway based on its location. The reception staff was very helpful and the room was clean. Our room was looking at a courtyard with a view on large ac, but we didnt spend much time in the room and we did not mind it. The bed was very comfortable. We also appreciated the water and artisanal sweets as welcome gifts. As a vegetarian I enjoyed the variety of cheese at the breakfast, even if my expectations were slightly higher from a five star hotel. The breakfast salon is at the ground level.  Arc de Triomphe is nicely visible from the breakfast salon. Overall, we thought it was a very nice stay, the pricequality ratio was very good, and that we would recommend it. NOT a 5 star experience.  We arrived around 2pm and our room was not ready, check in was 3pm but we didnt get into our room until 330.  They told us check out had been noon and they were working on rooms.. meanwhile not 1 person was waiting with us or there 3pm.. one would think you would look as to whom is checking in to your hotel to prepare the rooms needed for checkin?? First we were told they were working on it give them half an hour.. then were told wouldnt be til 3pm.. then shortly before 3 we were told 320pm.  Finally we checked in at 330 pm.  3 rooms could have been cleaned in that amount of time.. and again.. no one else checked in or was in line to checkin.  The manager offered a glass of champagne but after a nine hour flight we just wanted to shower and rest. We were offered another room to  freshen up in but again after a 9 hour flight who wants to unpack everything needed to shower, change etc. and then pack it all back up and move to another room?
Sink in bathroom sprayed water out of top of tap, the drain plug in the sink was just lying in the sink and wouldnt hold water, shower nozzle came off in my hand. The bathroom smelled like vomit  sink was clean but i think chunks were sitting in drain.. you caught a whiff everytine u walked in to bathroom.  Came back to the room after breakfast the next day and my friend's travel backgammon leather case was opened  it was inside her carry on  unzipped new game  puts you on alert someones going through your stuff. We brought these issues to the attention of the front desk we were offered breakfast for two mornings. Nobody showed up to fix anything... add in no replacement of bottled water daily either... its like once checked in you are on your own.  Sad.. nice hotel with great location... so much potential. The hotel was conveniently located, the staff was very helpful and quite friendly. Any time I had a question or asked for a recommendation, they were more than happy to accommodate and seemed pleased to do so. They even left us a bottle of Champagne and the best macarons. A lovely treat!

While our room was quite comfortable and spacious especially for a European hotel great rain shower by the way, we weren't told about the jackhammerdrilling that occurred each morning. As you might imagine, it's not a relaxing way to start the day and this happened most mornings.
I would recommend staying at the hotel, however, you might wish to wait until the construction is finished or ask prior to booking. Ours was booked as a vacation package thru Delta and I wish they Delta had told us prior to booking. Very pleasant hotel one block from the Arc de Triomphe and a short walk from the Champs dElysee. Rooms are well appointed and cared for. Comfortable bed and pillows. Good amenities.  Service was attentive. Nice welcoming touches. A cafe au lait on arrival. The macaroons and French strawberries waiting in my room were delicious. I had an inside courtyard room. Not a great view, but it was very quiet.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Staff were super attentive and friendly and breakfast was varied with plenty of French classics. The location is amazing, highly recommend! Not the cheapest hotel, but well worth spending a bit extra for such a pleasant stay. The room with a view of the Eiffel Tower! was lovely .. clean and spacious. The breakfast was the best ... lots of variety and great quality products. The staff made us feel special and very welcome. This hotel is a gem in the 1st District of Paris. It is located within a few minutes of many major sights, museums and shopping in Paris.  The staff is very friendly, polite, and always ready to make your stay enjoyable.  The rooms are elegantly decorated and comfortable, and our suite had a panoramic view of the Eiffel Tower and nearby gardens.  Highly recommended. Hotel Brighton in Paris is a fantastic choice, especially if you're looking for a place with a prime location. Situated right next to the Louvre, it offers easy access to some of the citys most iconic landmarks, making it perfect for sightseeing.

We stayed here during the Olympics, and the experience was nothing short of excellent. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, always ready to help with any requests. Their professionalism and warmth added a personal touch to our stay, making it even more enjoyable.

The breakfast at Hotel Brighton was another highlight. Each morning, we were treated to a delicious spread with a variety of options, all of which were fresh and flavorful. It was the perfect start to our busy days.

If youre planning a trip to Paris, especially during a big event like the Olympics, Hotel Brighton offers the ideal combination of location, service, and comfort. Highly recommended! We had an absolutely delightful stay at the Hotel Brighton. The Hotel Brighton could not have been more accommodating to our family as we arrived after an over night flight with two young children. We stayed in the family suite which was lovely and very large. The location is right across the street from the Louvre so it is in a very busy but centrally located area. We were able to walk from the hotel to wherever we wanted to go.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Britannique Hotel - Paris Centre,"20 Av. Victoria, 75001 Paris, France",4.7,48.85829,2.346381099999999,"Beautiful hotel with a nicely decorated lobby and room. The room on the 5th floor had a balcony with a great view of the nearby theater and a partial view of the Eiffel Tower. To our surprise, the top of the Eiffel Tower was also visible from the balcony, even though this wasn't advertised. The balcony had a table and two chairs and was decorated with beautiful flowers. We really enjoyed sitting out there every night. The room was clean and nicely decorated. The cleaning service was great. The breakfast selection was good, but the service could be improved they didn't refill the main food items, and we had to ask them to bring them as they were missing most of the time. Overall, we liked the hotel a lot and can definitely recommend it. The location is great too. Excellent location  in the city centre, but in a quiet area, next to the Seine River. Easy access from every district of the city  just upon the Chatelet metro station. The hotel is really beautiful cozy and elegant, stylish furniture. Everywhere is very clean. Stuff is nice and helpful. I can recommend the hotel for everyone. Hotel Britannique offers a superb travel experience.  Everyone is very helpful and friendly and the breakfasts for the reasonable price are amazing.  And you cant beat the location in one of the trendiest arrondissements of Paris. Built in 1860, this hotel has much character.  The room was decorated opulently, had a balcony with seating, and was clean as a whistle.  The staff spoke English, but were indulgent when I spoke French poorly.   The location was perfect, close to the Louvre and Musee d'Orsay expect to pay for this convenience.  Across the street is a wonderfully charming restaurant with excellent food, wine, and French ambiance. Nice little hotel very Parisian with small rooms but very clean. Only negative the bar on the corner goes until midnight with loud music even during the week. To bad will love stay on my next trip but the noise is to much","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Reseda Paris Porte de Bagnolet,"2 Av. du Général de Gaulle, 93170 Bagnolet, France",3.5,48.8662382,2.4174499,"The rooms are a tad bit small, but overall quality of them is expected from a 3star hotel. The only thing that really bothered me was that the window couldn't be closed, hence 2 stars for rooms. The service was great, there's a wide range of drinks and food at breakfast. There's also a bus line nearby, so it was quite easy to move around.
Overall, a good option for budget travellers We stayed in a triple room. For the price, you get fantastic value. Literally a 3 min walk to the metro, which is super efficient and takes you anywhere you need to go in the city. The rooms were turned over daily and kept very clean. Has 2 lifts so no lugging up and down stairs. Perfect stay for when you're out all daynight and need a quiet place to sleep ready for the next day. There is a supermarket in the next building where we picked up drinks and snacks for the week whilst sightseeing. We had a pleasant stay and would come back if we were to come back to Paris. First of all the pros , comfy bed and great air conditioning which was needed as it was 30c plus out and the rooms were tidy and maintained really well by the cleaners who did a excellent job , however there were more negatives than good , first of all is the disrespect we had because we were English, fortunately my partner can speak French but he heard them slagging us off cause we couldn't understand or speak French fully , I'm sorry it's based in  Paris where alot of British tourist come and is the world's main language it should be a basic to understand , we would have to do the same here in the UK. Secondly even though we got our deposit back the charge of 90 euros is not acceptable as it clearly doesn't state it online or at the desk , surely give customers notice on this prior to arrival rather than throwing it on them , finally please improve the amenities in the room , basics IE water in room , a kettle and a iron which can be used across multiple rooms . I personally wouldn't come back here even though the rooms were ok but the staffs attitude towards us because we weren't French was shocking. Perfect location only a few steps to both Metro and bus stop plus great facilities with comfortable bed as well as powerful shower and nicely fantastic room in such a reasonable budget price value for money !!!! HOWEVER terribly awfully rude customer service I had ever experienced in my life !!! Even the window can never be opened or controlled !!!! Hotel staffs never help for it Is it a 5star hotel? No. But are you expecting a 5 star hotel for the price? Also, no. Be aware of tourist tax and also 90 euro deposit

I 36f stayed here with my son 15m in September 2024. I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews of not only the hotel but the area.
I had decided to book as we were on a long weekend and planned only to use the hotel as a base.

Rooms are small, with only the bare essentials hairdryer, towels, disposable drinking cups, hangers and coat hooks, a bin, tv, seat, and wall mounted desk and AIRCON which was a god send, especially as the windows didn't open.

Although the rooms are small, the hotel has taken significant steps in order to reduce any soundlight pollution. The windows are doubled up, making it almost soundproof from the road outside, and the blackout curtains mean a very decent night's sleep, especially with the very comfortable beds

Using the information booth within the metro 3 minute walk, I managed to buy a travel ticket for the entirety of our stay, which worked on the metro trains I believe these same tickets also work on the buses
We did 2 days in disneyland via public transport and one day in the Paris Centre.

The only downside i found with this hotel is the breakfast. It was not an awful lot of choice, and what was there wasn't great. The pastries were stale, and the juice wasn't fresh.

All in all, I would stay here again. No frills, budget hotel with food and shops nearby, transport on your doorstep to anywhere in Paris and a place to sleep.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Would definitely stay again, nice bedrooms with no faults.  We stayed at the hotel for four days. The location, design and cleanliness of the hotel were very good. The breakfast was quite sufficient. The staff was very friendly. When Florence and Seeham learned that I was in Paris for my birthday, they decorated my room with balloons and surprised me. I would like to thank them once again for their kind thoughts. It was an unforgettable birthday and Paris trip for me. We had a lovely stay! We got an upgraded room and it was spacious and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and breakfast was lovely.

Hôtel de NELL,"9 Rue du Conservatoire, 75009 Paris, France",4.5,48.873258,2.346832,"We had a wonderful stay at Htel de NELL. Mathieu was extremely helpful and kind. He made sure we had everything we needed, translated for us and even made me a hair appointment. We highly recommend staying here! Lovely, modern and airy hotel with a lovely, friendly staff. Rooms are clean, comfortable and will offer you a complimentary Madeleine and Scone upon an arrival, a complimentary water bottle and Nespresso coffee and tea. There is a hairdryer and lovely smelling toiletries mind you, shampoo but no conditioner. My only comment would be about the lack of light in the shower area as there is a single, recessed bulb on he floor and you can't really see much and the sink, which although modern and clean,  splashes water unto you every time it's used it's a design defect I suspect. Location is great. Absolutely lovely hotel, very small, very clean. Staff were extremely kind and welcoming, would try and help if they could.. the view from the room was not very good, just facing walls. The breakfast was not very good, not much selection was available, didnt feel money well spent for the breakfast. However overall I would recommend staying here. Nice location near the gard de nord, 15 minutes walk Was greeted by very friendly lady names Jenny.  The rooms are very nice and clean.  Everything we needed was provided and our grandaughter was treated great.  Loves it! I align with many of the negative comments below The service was attentive and good, but the rooms and the overall experience was average. Definitely not a five stars and definitely not for the price we paid. Small rooms, not very functional no separation between shower and room, little light, view on a white wall, tiny cabinet not big enough for 2 people, small desk, coffee machine without tea spoons. The bed although comfortable was also small queen size but felt smaller in the tiny room. Hot water was also difficult to regulate. For that price you can pay 2 nights in a 3 stars and would feel the same. Furthermore, the hotel is located in a pretty dead area, which is good for the quietness at night, but feels a bit odd.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Villa d'Estrées,"17 Rue Gît-le-Cœur, 75006 Paris, France",4.8,48.8535089,2.3425787,"Even before we arrived they reached out to offer us an airport ride, we felt we had made a good choice and our minds were at ease. The staff is very attentive and always eager to assist. Romantic, very clean and fresh bottled glass water daily. Quiet location but steps to restaurants, shopping, metro. Hot water, firm beds, comfy couch  chair in room. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Nice quiet rooms in a hotel very close to a buzzing part of the city. Very close to the station and therefore very easy to see all parts of Paris. We went during the Olympics and love the hotel and the location.  Staff was incredible helpful and friendly! The staff are immensely helpful, and the drivers they provide are knowledgeable, capable, and friendly. Our room could have used a bit of refurbishing, and I wouldve loved a drawer or two.  However, the bed was comfortable, and the room was kept tidy by an excellent housekeeper. The hotels location in the 6th Arr. could hardly be more convenient though parties in the neighborhood kept us up past midnight several nights. We decided the music and laughter were local color and therefore charming enough to accept. All in all, Id stay there again! Magnifique customer service from Willy who provided Gold star service during our stay. The location is excellent and rooms comfortable, clean and classic with wonderful room service. Highly recommend this hotel, and spending lots of time in the Latin Quarter. My wife and I spent a wonderful 3 nights at this small boutique hotel.   After researching numerous hotels in Paris, I decided on this hotel for its location and size of the rooms.  Both were spot on, with plenty of space in the bedroom and bathroom which is rare to find in Paris, especially at this price point.  The rooms were clean and well appointed, although they could use a little touch up.

The location is walking distance to the lively Latin quarter and some top jazz clubs.  A quick walk to notre dame, the louvre and  Luxembourg gardens. But also on a quiet side street to rerun to at the end of the day.

Putting our stay over the top, was the wonderful staff.   My wife and I speak very little French, but Guillaume and Willy were amazingly hospitable and gave us wonderful recommendations on restaurants, boulangeries and anything else one may need to know on a first visit to Paris.   We will definitely book this hotel again when we return.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Izzy,"3 Rue Georges Marie, 92130 Issy-les-Moulineaux, France",4.2,48.8287525,2.2831386,"Heres an updated version reflecting your expectations for a fourstar hotel



I recently stayed at this hotel and, unfortunately, had a very disappointing experience. Upon arrival, I was given a room with a strong, stale air and humid smell of mold, which made it uncomfortable to stay in. After requesting a change, I was moved to a groundfloor room that was problematic due to the constant noise. I could hear every sound from the corridor, and it was so loud that I had to sleep with earplugs. For a fourstar hotel, this is simply not acceptable. I expected a much higher standard of comfort and quality, and I was really let down by the overall experience. Great find. Low cost hotel with clean, well serviced rooms, fantastic staff and a varied snd delicious breakfast bar. Would return anytime. Nice hotel, good vibe, clean. Good location near metro. Unfortunately windows are not the best quality so in colder periods you get lots of water drops from condensation in the wondows area, and humidity overall in the room I stayed for 1 night  I must say the room was great!
In the morning, breakfast was also good with a lot of selection  you can eat whatever you want  as much as you want.

Staff was great at reception. Steps away from a metro station, this hotel offers cozy, clean rooms and friendly staff, ensuring a comfortable stay. While breakfast options are limited, the prices are fair and the amenities are convenient. Despite occasional noise disturbances, it provides good value.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel La Maison Champs Elysées,"8 Rue Jean Goujon, 75008 Paris, France",4.0,48.8666594,2.3090132,"There are so many amazing things I can say about this hotel!
Firstly, we were immediately greeted by 3 friendly staff. They insisted on taking our bags from our hands and letting us focus on check in. The energy of the staff was warm, welcoming, and funny.
When we checked into our room, we had made a special request since it was our honeymoon... and they decorated the room beautifully with rose pedalsballoons and chocolatesfruits. Truly a welcomed sight and we felt very important. Special shout out to Younes for organizing this.

The room was clean, the property was lovely, and the staff were 100. Would recommend to anyone, any day. Thank you for our stay!

Also a special mention to Mario and Sam  Beautiful hotel exterior in a beautiful location. Service from staff polite and professional. However the rooms were not up to date. Very poor for a 5 star hotel. They dont let you know they have old and new buildings. It seems they choose who to put in their old building based on appearance. When they walk you to your room, it feels like going into a shady back room. Not to mention one of our rooms wasnt ready until way past checkin time. I had to message the front desk from my one room to ask them if they could cancel the other room so that I and my family can stay in one room since the two rooms I booked werent ready at the same time. Thats when they decided the other room was now ready. The interior of the rooms did not feel like a five star stay at all. The pictures I saw prior to booking didnt translate to real life aesthetic. Maybe those lucky enough to get the new building got the pleasant experience.

Update. Thanks to the hotel personelle who reached out to me with an explanation. I appreciate the courteous gesture. Location Good not great. Fairly central to most of the city and a short walk to a metro station, although not the most convenient line. Most of the surrounding area is luxury shopping and lacks much in the way of personality and small businessrestaurants we were looking for.

HotelRoom I know it's a Marriott Design hotel but honestly it just seemed lazy. Lots of tile and mirrors doesn't make the room unique or cool. There was nothing egregiously bad about the room but small inconveniences added up. Things like underpowered AC, no outlets that didn't already have something plugged into them, terrible water pressure in the shower. For the priceaward points, I would expect more and likely wouldn't stay here again at the going rate.

Service The best part. We were greeted with cucumber and watermelon infused water ready for us, check in was fast, and the hotel staff was friendly and accommodating at every step.

All in all, the staff was the redeeming factor in an otherwise unspectacular hotel. There are better options in Paris and there are worse options. Sure, the rooms could probably use some upgrading  it can seem sterile at times. The only other potential complaint was that the second sink in the room's hot water didn't work properly. The service alone truly makes up for it, in my opinion. Everyone that works at this property are tremendous, and I cannot give higher praise to the team. I personally believe that this was worth the reward points, and I would recommend. The location is also super. Ive had a great experience in my room, but cant speak much about the hotel as I havent spent much time here other than to sleep. The water temperature and pressure have been excellent in the shower and the AC gets pretty cold. The room and the surrounding area have been very quiet and the bedding is comfy so Ive slept well each night. Its a nice bonus to be able to earn Bonvoy points too. The staff has been very helpful and kind. The event coordinator Sam even helped us get two free VIP tour passes to the Louvre on the day we checked in. I believe another guest wasnt able to use them and she rang us up. It was a bonus to an already great stay. Id definitely stay here again.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Le Pavillon,"54 Rue Saint-Dominique, 75007 Paris, France",4.5,48.860003,2.3094497,"Very cute hotel. If you walk out the front door and look to the right you have a great view of the Eiffel Tower. The young woman who checked us in was extremely pleasant. She was smiling and courteous. She spoke terrific English as well. The room was very nice. The shower was great pressure and hoy water. Bed was comfortable and large. I would definitely recommend this place and stay here again. The overnight clerk was also very nice when we checked out in the AM. Great employees! Easy check in with Danny and Adel were very helpful and professional, also close to everything of course rooms are tiny but this is Paris. I will definitely come back if I stopped by Paris in the future. Also I like how they are going green. Awesome central location and within walking distance to so many landmarks and sites!! Very accessible transit to anywhere in the city as well!!

Room was bright, clean, and honestly bigger than expected we were bracing for really small bed was a queen and really comfy and we had a brand new renovated bathroom in our room! Staff were friendly and everything was very clean! Would come back! This hotel was great for the value.  The bed was comfortable and it was a short walk from the Eiffel Towers and small cafes.  The room was very small, but we were expecting that and did not spend much time there anyway.  The hotel was very clean. I have sent an email in October 7,8 and 11th.

Hôtel Eiffel Kensington,"79 Av. de la Bourdonnais, 75007 Paris, France",3.1,48.8565647,2.3021859,"You, like me, may be so excited to stay somewhere with an advertised ""view"" of the Eiffel Tower.  That view is obstructed.  I wish that was the worst part of this hotel.  The worst part of the hotel was that the shower was too small for us to shower in, and we couldn't sit comfortably on the toilet because it is so close to the wall.  And that was even worse than us coming home the only night we were there and someone was being violently arrested outside.  The pillows were uncomfortable, and our fan made noise and shook side to side.  Please take my warning and do not stay here. I wish I could give zero stars. Please dont book this for any reason at all. The pics are lies. You do not view the Eiffel Tower. The room is small and disgusting. Me and my friend stayed there and we are both sick and people were saying they found mouse feces and mold infestation. Do not book it for any reason even if its free. If you're looking for a hotel full of mold and dust. This is your hotel. Found mouse feces in my room. The worker told me there were mice in the basement. Maybe that's where the mouse feces came from. The location is good but not worth staying here. Save your money and go somewhere else. I woke up sick for all the dust and mold. The ceiling fan felt like it was going to fall on me. We had good experience in this place, the staff is friendly. The service is good. They had great breakfast. And the location is  only few minutes walk away for Ieffel Tower! Came for a couples weekend getaway, Beautiful location however the rooms are disgusting, washrooms too tiny. Can barely fit 2 people in there.  Sheets smelled like cigarettes, i had to lay my clothes down in order to fall asleep
My partner paid for a room with a view only to get a back alley with a neighbour cooking his evening meal.
Every time we needed to shower our legs would hit the toilet.  The pictures on the website are fake. Great location but absolutely dreadful accommodation.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Victoires Opéra,"56 Rue Montorgueil, 75002 Paris, France",3.7,48.8648876,2.346937399999999,"DO NOT STAY here.

It's basically a scam. Not a 4 star hotel at all I wish I would have seen the Google reviews before booking. We left the hotel at 1130 PM and booked another hotel on the spot. I've been trying to reach the ""manager"" for two days and am now giving up and disputing with my credit card company. I've attached a video, turn your phone volume up to the maximum to hear about half of what it sounds like to stay in this place. The recording is not as loud as reality because my phone microphone is recording it. In reality it was like standing 2 meters away from a noisy bar. I've stayed at over 30 four and five star hotels all over the world and this is the worse.

Not just noise, there's no electric plugs next to the night stands, elevator wasn't working, AND the AC wasn't working and it was very hot and if you opened the window, then it was like standing right next to the bar. This hotel should be 2 stars or forced to close for renovations to have proper windows that actually seal to the building to prevent sound.

Only positive thing is the location, but does that matter if you can't sleep at all? 05 stars if I could. Owner should be fined, and the hotel should be closed to renovate the windows. Typical Parisian hotel, main room was ok but very small bathroom. Otherwise a nice hotel with friendly staff. The staff working the front desk were great. That is one of the reasons why I didn't rate the Hotel lower than a one star Hotel. The other reason is because I was not allowed to give a rating of a half star. If it were not for the staff the rating would be Zero 0 . For two days of our four night stay there was no hot water. We had to take cold showers. Not only is the furniture very old there was a smell of mildew in the room. We were given towels that were not very clean, which were returned to the front desk along with one towel, that was also dirty, with a large hole in the center. I can say that the location of the Hotel is great. See photos and read reviews for the Hotel Victoria rooms in Durbuy, Belgium. Everything you need to know about the Hotel Victoria rooms at Tripadvisor. To start with, this hotel is in perfect location to explore Paris and bars and restaurants around the place. That's where nice things about this hotel end. I was on the first floor overlooking a busy street with bars and it gets extremely loud everynight. Windows are paper thin. One of the windows didn't have a handle so the gap was filled with some tissue and because of the proximity of the bar downstairs my room smelt like cigarette smoke every night. Breakfast was 15 a day and all you get is some rolled ham, pastry and bad coffee. There are many other places for breakfast around the hotel so don't waste your money here.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Astoria - Astotel,"42 Rue de Moscou, 75008 Paris, France",4.4,48.8817094,2.3229803,"Stayed for a week in Sept 2024.
Location close to Metro stations.
Neighborhood is quiet, fairly safe.
The rooms are small typical of hotels like this in Paris and  show sign of age but clean, bed was comfortable. Appreciate the minibar, which is replenished daily with water soda and juice.
Kudos to the breakfast crew especially Arleen and Tej, who aimed to please and kept the busy breakfast area well supplied. Front desk was friendly, especially Raphael. Maintenance Edgar was very responsive.
Bang for your buck. Will stay there again next time! Great location, great service, but the rooms are a tad small. Our room window faced a central patio and you could hear the neighbours or smell people smoking through the windows. Other than that, we really liked the hotel. Small rooms, but that is normal in this area of Paris. This is not a criticism, just trying to inform people that this is the situation in many hotels in this city. Breakfast was quite decent, and I especially loved how well situated it was and the fact that they allowed you to have free snacks and drinks from the minibar. We really liked this hotel. It was located closed to a metro station, making it easier to navigate around Paris. This hotel is part of a group of hotels spread around Paris and your key works in the other hotels. For instance, when we wanted to cool off and take a break we would go to a sister hotel and relax  We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights during the Olympic Games. We booked more than 6 months in advanced and they completely robed us. We payed 400night on a double room for 3 rooms and the experience was very bad. The hotel rooms have nothing to do with the pictures in their website, they are super small and antique with 0 taste. The shower was tiny and hot water stopped after 30 seconds. They only provide 1 soap for everything. Our room was up from the breakfast room and in the morning it smelled a lot like food. Elevator is terribly slow and we left very disappointed we spent so much money for the quality received. Nice to point out there was free water in the minibar.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Sévigné Hotel - Paris Tour Eiffel,"6 Rue de Belloy, 75116 Paris, France",4.4,48.868851,2.2924264,"There is no car parking under the hotel. They offer to take your car to a parking garage close by with an additional fee.
But street parking is available on the next street. Just download the app you should be good to go, if you find a spot.

The location was good and the room was clean.
The reception staff was very nice and friendly. I am happy to stay in this hotel because it has many positives. The most important of which is the behavior of the employees working there, especially the receptionists during the morning shift Wendy and Angela. They were very helpful and accommodating with the clients which shows their professionalism. I would also like to pay tribute to the unique location of the hotel.
Thank you from the heart. My boyfriend and I recently visited Paris for the first time and stayed at Hotel De Svign.  We found the boutique hotel to be such a nice experience and the staff were so kind! They went above and beyond to meet our needs. On our first day we were very jet lagged and they let us check in 6 hours early for no extra charge. We also loved our room! The balcony and view were such a nice touch. The things we were a little disappointed about but it didnt affect our trip was the fact that the housekeeper did not leave us enough toilet paper so we kept having to ask the front desk for more. The bathrooms also dont have fans, so the room gets steamed up really easily which caused the fire alarm to go off and the guests all ran downstairs to the lobby concerned. Other than that, our stay was amazing and the location of this hotel was the best!!! Such a safe, quiet area yet near so many attractions and close to metro stations. We were surprised by how close the arc de triomphe was less than a 5 min walk and Eiffel Tower 10 min walk. There are also some beautiful cafes close by that we loved! Our favourite was Merci Jerome. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Paris! I'll start with our arrival. We arrived very very early around 9 am as we had an early flight arrival. The staff were very accommodating. They could not obviously give us our room yet but took our luggage and stored it in a room behind the check in desk and offered to email me as soon as the room was ready. Which they did around 130 pm. The hotel is a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe. We were also able to walk to the Eiffel Tower within 25 minutes. The walk to the Louvre was much longer at 45 minutes but we are walkers so it was fine. Uber was extremely reasonable just FYI. We used it to go back to the hotel a few times. The room was small but perfectly fine for our needs. I love that there is an elevator. Some smaller hotels in older buildings do not have this. The room and bathroom were very clean. We opted to not have them clean the room during our short stay so I can't comment on that. We didn't have breakfast either so no comment on that. There are many restaurants within walking distance. The hotel emailed me a list of their recommendations prior to arrival. We did go to one of them which was less than a minute walk from the hotel. Very good food. We felt completely safe in this neighborhood and it is very quiet. We stayed for a night in a room with the balcony. The room was very nice with a great balcony view. The staff was very friendly. There is a little cafe and bar downstairs where they give a welcome drink. They also keep little pastries and water at the front desk. This was a perfect location near a bunch of shops and restaurants, also the Eiffel Tower and Trocadro!","Monday: Open 24 hours

I would recommend this hotel to anyone to stay and would absolutely return. The hotel staff went above and beyond to ensure our night stay was as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. We were greeted with delicious croissants upon arrival, and when we checked out , since it was so early we couldnt enjoy the breakfast, so they made us coffee and Madeleine cookies to go. It was so kind, thoughtful and so much appreciated before we boarded our train!! The hotel is  located in an excellent area where you can walk to many restaurants and see the Eiffel Tower. This hotel was absolutely amazing, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We were traveling with our children and reserved 2 rooms. They were able to accommodate connecting rooms. The rooms were quaint, well themed and super clean. They even prepared hot chocolate for our children when we had an early checkout. Location was so close to the Eiffel Tower and walkable to all the major sights. Would certainly stay again and highly recommend. We had a wonderful stay here, the staff were very welcoming and friendly. They offered lots of recommendations and gave us a map showing which streets were closed due to the Olympics offering alternative routes. We arrived early planning to store our luggage and explore the city, but we were told our room was ready early so we were able to check in right away. The location was perfect, just a short walk to the Eiffel Tower and there are many restaurants close by. The room was small but very clean and comfortable. Would definitely come back if Im ever in Paris again! I stayed here for 2 nights. The room is super cozy and the location is quite good. Its only 1015 mins walk to Eiffel tower. There are many small shops cafe around this area.

You will only get a bottle of water per person when you arrive but they will not replenish in the next day. The only improvement I would recommend. We recently stayed here for our first visit to Paris and were extremely impressed with this hotel, the staff and the location.  Our room had a view of the Eiffel Tower and was so clean and wonderful.  The front desk staff were exceptional and the breakfast was so great.

AC makes the space a cool and quiet retreat. Walking distance from Metro, Seine River, many Restaurants. We had a family suite with adjoining rooms.  The staff was gracious and helpful and let us check in early when we arrived after an overnight flight.  Great location next to Jardin du Luxembourg DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!
Tried to charge us more up front until we showed him the price we  booked. He still wanted more money but we refused!
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! Bed broke when sat on it. Rooms are tiny, if you are travelling with kids they will give you cots that  collapse with wood bottom and no blankets.had to demand mattress and was told blankets only for adults  had to take blankets off another room with no help. When the concierge didnt know how to put up cots he  left us to figure it out, then was told not his problem. Breakfast room is in the reception lobby. Breakfast is expensive and not worth it. No fridge in rooms shower is tiny and bathroom can fit only 1 person at a time  The floors in the rooms are also  uneven and on tilted slants. We had 3 rooms and they were all the same. We would never stay here again.
TERRIBLE HTEL!!! TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!
PHOTOS DO NOT LOOK LIKE THE ROOMS!!!! The location is good and quiet at night. We had a room located towards the theater and enjoyed our sleep and view. The staff was friendly and let me leave something in their fridge overnight. There is always someone at the desk, even at one am. The hotel feels safe, and there is a small elevator. Some things to note are the rooms have one USB and one usbc charging port, there is no microwave or fridge in the room. I felt the superior room was spacious enough for two, but of course much smaller than I am used to. The shower room is small too, even for the superior room. We recently stayed at Hotel Michelet Odon, and its location is absolutely fantastic for walking and exploring Paris. The rooms and bathrooms were modern and clean, which made for a comfortable stay. Though the rooms were quite small, it was a reasonable tradeoff given the prime location. The only downside was that the wifi in the room wasn't great. I would definitely stay here again when I return to Paris in the future. very bad rooms and bad attitude at the reception. they force you to leave the key whenever you are leaving the room for security purposes. at 7 in the morning the housekeeper started to make a lot of noise so we could not rest as we wished. the price of the room can ONLY be justified by the location, but nothing more.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Le Quartier Bercy - Square,"33 Bd de Reuilly, 75012 Paris, France",4.3,48.83949620000001,2.3926992,"Fabulous hotel with lovely friendly staff who didn't laugh at our mangling the language and were kind enough to keep our bags until the evening of the day we checked out.
The room wasn't massive but it had enough room for two of us and was bright and clean. We are both plus sized and had no problems in the bathroom my 6ft plus fiance liked that the shower went up high enough  they don't always. The breakfast was plentiful and varied my only tip would be that if you like your tea the english way bring some with you  ceylon and earl grey are the strongest you will get in most places in Paris.
The location of the hotel worked really well for us as there are lots of local restaurantsbars but you don't have to fight of a million tourists to get in yet most of the really touristy things were a quick metro or bus ride away and super easy to get to A great option for a short stay near Gare de Lyon area especially if you are arriving late into the station or have an early train to catch.

Courtyard was a green oasis, reception staff were very friendly and welcoming, despite us checking in past midnight and leaving early the next day.

Rooms were clean, basic but functional, with comfortable beds. It was a great value for money option and would even recommend for longer stays. Rooms were small as with many Parisian independent hotels, but never felt cramp or hard to manoeuvre in the room.

There was also useful and thoughtful information provided about the surrounding area and the kettle with hot drinks  bottled water were a nice touch. Nice hotel, rooms are small clean and comfortable.
Great value for money.
Staff are very nice.
Only 4 minute walk to the metro. The hotel is peaceful, with really nice and helpful receptionists. My niece and I stayed at this hotel for two nights before the beginning of the 2024 Olympics, and we felt really fortunate since the hotel is placed not in the heart of the city, but rather near a strategic train station that can take us anywhere we want. I definitely suggest this hotel as an option when you visit Paris. Thank you, Le Quartier Bercy, for delivering the greatest service to us. The building is located on a busy avenue.  However, the hotel itself is set in an inner courtyard, so it is very quiet.
There are several shops, cafs and restaurants on the avenue.  The building is located between two metro stops.
The rooms are not very big, or rather quite small, but this is normal in France.
We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but there is a Monoprix grocery store around the corner, which opens at 8am.","Monday: Open 24 hours

We are already looking forward to our next stay! My wife  I are just home today
First time to stay at this hotel  it did not disappoint
The newly decorated room was beautiful  the view of the Eiffel tower was fantastic
The complimentary bottle of Champagne for our anniversary was a lovely touch  appreciated 
Location was a bit quite , but close enough to all the main attractions
Highly recommend this hotel !
We will be back for sure ! A great hotel in a quiet neighborhood. On the edge of the Left Bank, it is very walkable to the Place de la Concorde and the Right Bank as well as to the Left Bank. The Musee d'Orsay is right around the corner. The rooms are lovely. The hotel pays attention to the environment which is always nice! The staff is helpful and welcoming. Have had two wonderful stays there in the past year. Beautiful clean room, comfy bed, delicious breakfast, fabulous front desk staff, quiet location, great brasserie nearby, very approachable manager, felt very safe, I could go on and on. It was a home away from home, and we hated to leave. We will very definitely stay here next trip to Paris. Divine! Best, most elegant home away from home ever! This hotel is elegant, the BEST location, and truly a joy to stay here. Ive stayed here 3 times, once with family and twice for business travel. There is nothing to improve upon here, its truly a pleasure any chance I can stay here in one of my favorite cities in the world.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Lutetia,"45 Bd Raspail, 75006 Paris, France",4.5,48.8508225,2.3272754,"Just stopped for late night drinks at their very nice bar. Very creative drinks in a nice atmosphere. Can't speak to the rooms because they are a little out of my price range but a beautiful looking hotel. Fantastic location on the left bank.
Service is outstanding, rooms are big and very comfortable.
We loved the breakfast and the Bar with fantastic Bar tenders who make sublime cocktails. Love to come back in Lutetia hotel Paris Absolutely amazing. We stayed here for a week and each night was enjoyed. The room was immaculate, in room dining was delicious and the service was posh and accommodating throughout the entire staff. We did a few spa treatments which were wonderful and the spa amenities were perfect. Everything you expect from a palace hotel was here. We are grateful to have stayed here and would again. Thank you Hotel Lutetia  We stayed for 3 nights at The Hotel Lutetia in September and it was amazing. Everything about our experience could not have been more perfect. The beautiful room and bathroom with a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower, the delicious breakfasts, the beautiful spa and gym and the very helpful and polite concierge and staff. We understand they did a major renovation of the hotel about 5 years ago and it is absolutely stunning from the rooms, bar, breakfast room, hallways and spa. Everything feels very elegant. We would highly recommend this hotel which is located in SaintGermaindes Pres  a perfect location to walk to many of the Parisian sights. We loved our stay here and feel quite spoiled now. I dont know how we could stay anywhere else in Paris when we return! I stay in Paris in this amazing hotel for couple of days and I loved everything about it.
Service, decor, location etc , but what I loved more was the cocktails made by the bartender Arianna, she was super professional and very friendly and the drinks were amazing.
Will be back in this hotel next time I will be in Paris again.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Location and viewing places from the hotel to Eiffel towel was very good! Staff was not very helpful and didnt care about any concerns we had. From asking advice to the fact that we were covered in some sort of bites from something in the room. Even charged us extra for a crappy cup of coffee that they made it seem we could take. Great location, right next to Eiffel Tower! A boutique hotel with great customer service. Very clean. Great views from every room including the bathroom! So much within walking distance. We stayed for one night before driving down to south France and we definitely want to go back for longer! Follow me on IG for more content on this hotel and the area! jennmerlin I highly recommend this hotel . We booked the suite on the 6th floor so we could have the view of the Eiffel Tower. What an amazing view from the room. The room was spacious and accommodated our family of 4. The hotel staff were super friendly and helpful . The location was walking distance to lots of restaurants. Perfect location! My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Hotel Eiffel Trocadero and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The views of the Eiffel Tower are breathtaking, the location is convenient and the staff particularly Karim and Ewa is extremely attentive  helpful. We didn't want to leave! Great location right next to trocadero. All the front desk staff were exceptional, always kind and helpful!

Hôtel Prince Albert Opéra,"89 Rue de Provence, 75009 Paris, France",3.4,48.8741791,2.3311189,"I checked in right after midnight due to flight delays. The check in procedure was easy and quick.  The elevator did not work and hotel employee carried out all my luggage to my room. Inside it is extremely clean and cozy and bathroom is sparkling clean and new, room is small, typical for  Paris, same as New York, but not tiny,  and it has everything you need, shower is bigger then some NYC hotels got Breakfast is 13 euros or you can just pay for coffee. I highly recommend. The hotel is in an amazing location close to the Opera and Galerie Lafayette. All the main Paris museums are a walkable distance away and the room was decently sized, clean, and quite modern. I was pleasantly surprised by the end of my stay and hope to return. The staff were extremely friendly and willing to help with anything you needed or asked for. Everyone communicated very well in English.
The hotel is very well located, close to several subway stations and various tourist and shopping spots. The street and area have several bars, restaurants and supermarkets.
The room is beautiful and cozy, just like in the photos, extremely comfortable, clean and quiet. The shower was very good and hot. Ohhh! Cant wait to be back!
The BEST location! La Fayette around the corner, few steps to Opera, and nice walk to Louvre or Eiffel Tower.
Rooms  bathrooms are new and super clean.
Customer service at the highest level 
They were very nice and helpful.
Everytime I got back, I kept telling myself that this was the best hotel I could have dreamed of in Paris  Fantastic! I dont understand the low rating online  it was great.

Le Regent Montmartre,"37 Blvd Marguerite de Rochechouart, 75009 Paris, France",3.9,48.8827959,2.345061499999999,"I am deeply disappointed with my stay at Le Regent Montmartre. Not only were the conditions unacceptable, but the response to my formal complaint revealed a complete lack of professionalism from the management.
First, the absence of soap for washing hands after using the toilet in the shared bathrooms is simply outrageous, especially in a postpandemic context where hygiene is crucial. There was no clear mention that soap had to be purchased at the reception. This is a basic hygiene requirement that every establishment should provide, particularly in shared spaces.
Secondly, the elevator was out of service for the entire duration of my stay, reportedly because someone had vomited in it or left foodwho knows. This not only made the elevator unusable, but it forced me to carry heavy luggage up the stairs without any assistance. No attempt was made to resolve this issue promptly, which is a clear violation of basic hygiene and accessibility standards.
The checkin process was a nightmare, with a 30minute wait and four return trips to the reception before I could finally get into my room. No key card was provided, meaning I had to go to the reception every single time I needed access to my rooman incredibly frustrating and avoidable issue.
As for the room, there was a strong odor of cheese that made the experience unbearable. While it may not have been strictly a cleanliness issue, it was still a terrible experience overall, and the staffs justification that it was ""normal"" for a dormitory was both condescending and unacceptable.
Finally, the staffs behavior was disrespectful and condescending, which only worsened the situation. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, my legitimate frustration was downplayed, and I was treated as if I should expect such poor conditions.
I strongly advise against this establishment for anyone seeking even a minimum level of comfort and customer service. Unfortunately, no refund was offered despite these major inconveniences, and the management seems entirely disinterested in improving the guest experience. A small room with a window facing a busy street, where it stays very noisy until late at night.
There was a fan in the room, but it wasn't needed during the September stay.
The room was clean and the staff was friendly.
The breakfast consisted of a croissant, baguette, jam, and coffee, so it's worth considering having breakfast outside the hotel. However, the location is great, and the reception is open 247. During my recent stay at here in Paris, I was immensely impressed by the hospitality provided by Ibrahim. His dedication to his role was evident in every interaction, making this place so good. Ibrahim has the ture spirit of Parisian hospitality, to go above and beyond to ensure guests feel welcome and cared for. His warm and welcoming demeanor needs to be praised. exceptional service skills. Kudos to the management for having such an outstanding team member. Ibrahim, keep doing what you are doing! We had a single room on the fourth floor and stayed two nights. The location was the best part  Sacre Coeur, Gare Du Nord and several metro stations of different lines are close by making it easy to get around the city. Our room was clean and tidy with a fine bathroom. It was small and had no view, but didn't matter. Some noise from other rooms and the street but nothing you wouldn't expect from a hostel in the city. I really enjoyed my two night stay here. My room was spacious for one person I had my own bathroom, bathtub, sink and two balconies with an incredible view. Area is not bad I felt safe and would take the metro to all the places I wanted to see with no problem.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The bathroom wasn't cleaned properly some moldleftover trash but other than that it was good. Friendly staff, nice sized rooms, an elevator, etc. They let us sit in the lobby for a while after checkout before it was time to head to the airport. Would stay again. Worst hotel ever!!! Dont fall for the fake reviews. There is no one to help us right now. Im in a suite with two children and no lights. The front desk guy refuses to get a lamps or even a light. How does the room not have lights that are functioning? They cant repair. There is no water in the room as promised. No WiFi. No ironing board. They make you wait for check in and have half a closet for a suite. Avoid save your money and go somewhere else. Really enjoyed our stay here. The suite was small but had everything we needed, including a really lovely bathroom and a very comfy bed. No complaints about the sofa bed either! The quality of accessories such as toiletries, towels and bedding was very good too. Nice to be able to make a cup of tea between outings! Staff were really helpful and welcoming. Loved the view onto the avenue Marceau  the location can't be faulted. It was a 20 min leisurely walk to the Eiffel Tower, for example. Wish we could have stayed longer, would definitely come here again next time we're in Paris. Don't ignore the negative reviews...

First, the good  excellent location and no bedbugs. The staff was nice enough, but nothing beyond the basic courtesies.

The bad... The room was impossibly small we chose the junior suite  the room might be fine for a single traveler with light luggage, but for two, it was pretty cramped. The coffee service was never reset during our 6 night stay, and the housekeeping was indifferent for the first couple of nights. The mini bar wasn't restocked and the sparkling water had been emptied and refilled with tap water at some point before our arrival.

Look, I get it... Europe has small rooms sometimes  our experience in those cases is to move our clothes to the wardrobe and drawers... The problem is that due to the size of the room, you can't open the wardrobe all the way and the drawers were functionally inaccessible.

To top it off, the room had a persistent swampy smell from the time we arrived until we left. We were profoundly disappointed with the Helzear and wouldn't recommend it under any circumstances. booked for a night. the location was great and so close to everything. amenities were abundant and rooms were small but clean. our receptionist saad was so terrific so kind, hospitable and welcoming. honestly, he was the best part of the stay!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Le M,"20 bis Rue de la Gaité, 75014 Paris, France",4.1,48.8396834,2.3234017,"Location Very good, within 30 minutes bus ride to best attractions.
Service Tried to buy only 2 coffees and 2 croissants but been told that is not possible and I have to buy their 11 euros breakfast, special thing what can I say.

Rooms 1.6 stars at maximum, the rooms are smelling, the walls are all scratched and there is mould on them. First room had the bathroom very bad affected by the mould and luckily I got another one on my request.

I dont want to be that person complaining, the only reason Im leaving this review is that the stars of the hotel are misleading. It cannot be a 4 stars hotel, looking at the rooms at this hotel and another 4 stars I stayed I can give it a generous 1.6 stars!

If this was a 1.6 stars I wouldve understood but 4 stars is very far away from that.

RE

I had to insist and insist to the person that i only want 2 coffees and 2 croissants, it doesn't help with anything if i got 2 croissants free. Its all about the experience, your croissants doesn't justify the 4 stars hotel.

Its interesting that from all what i written all you have to say is i gave you 2 croissants.

This could've ended very bad as some people with allergy to mold could've need medical help because of your rooms.

Shocking! Unbeatable location for a reasonable price.  Very close to Gare Montparnasse, and the street it is on is itself lively with bars. If you face the courtyard, it is quiet. Breakfast and gym are in the basement. There are a couple of flies in the room during the summer if you open the windows. If you are pulling trolley luggage, the access to the metro has only stairs. Our room was a good size and it had air conditioning. It is also very close to tons of great restaurants! After we checked out the hotel my wife found out that she left her expensive jewelry behind.  We contacted Lubin at the reception and she told us that they got her jewelry and will hold it for us to pick it up.  Unfortunately we were on the way to Rome, Italy.  After exchanging some conversations and arranged the FedEx to shipped her jewelry back to US.  Finally she got her jewelry today.  We so happy and appreciate le M hotel manager and staff member of doing up and beyond to making sure her jewelry arrived safely in her hand.
Not only that.. Hotel le M provides exceptional hospitality and very friendly staff and services, honest
We will highly recommend all our friends and business partners to Hotel le M and definitely stay with them next trip to Paris
Merci Right near the 6th and so close to everything including 2 metro stops. Rooms are pretty basic but that's what you get at this price but seriously, who spends time in their rooms except to SSS?","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Gramont Paris,"22 Rue de Gramont, 75002 Paris, France",4.4,48.8705649,2.3369868,"Had a wonderful 4night stay here. Rooms are wellstocked, very clean and a decent size for Paris. Loved being on the top floor with a balcony as long as you can manage your bags up a small staircase as the elevator doesnt go right to the top floor. Breakfast was excellent, never crowded and available until 1030am each day which is nice if you like to sleep in a bit. Staff was all very friendly and we will gladly return for another stay. Stayed 5 nights in their EXECUTIVE SUITE. Decent size room which could probably fit 4 people 3 adults or 2 adults2 children 1 double bed and a sofa bed

Easily walkable to the Opera, Place Vendomme, and Galleries Lafayette.

Access to 2 Metro lines 3and 8 about 5 minutes away.

Hotel staff were all friendly and very helpful. Very friendly staff and very clean rooms. Nice location!  Thank you very much for everyone! Never book the standard room. I paid 400usd a night and got the ground floor room, 1 meter from the ""reception"" and breakfast, woth a window open to the street. Excellent hotel, would gladly return for another visit. The room was a very good size and very well appointed. Staff were excellent during our 5 night stay.

Hotel Edouard VII,"39 Av. de l'Opéra, 75002 Paris, France",4.5,48.8683206,2.333098,"The hospitality we experienced here was world class. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome and the staff was so attentive to all of our needs. Helen and Hugo at the front desk were so helpful and answered any questions we had.  They really went above and beyond. The rest of the staff was also incredible. The location is also ideal and very close to the metro station as well as lots of places to eat and shop. Not to mention the beautiful view of the Opera! The rooms are charming, clean and comfortable. I slept so well every night after long days of walking and sightseeing.

We accidentally left a couple of valuable items in our room after checking out and we were stressed out trying to find them. Renaud reached out to us after finding them and has been so helpful. We are truly so appreciative.

I cant recommend this place enough. We look forward to staying here again if we ever find ourselves so lucky to be back in Paris. This was a fabulous stay at the Hotel Edouard 7! We came to Paris for our Honeymoon and this was a superb experience, the hotel is central to town we walked almost everywhere, but you have the metro and bus stops nearby. The concerige was acceptional! The laundry service was very convient. Our beds were comfy, every night they gave us chocolates and turned down the bed. The breakfast buffet's fresh baguettes and croissants were magnificent with my cappuccino. They care very much about the details, our bathroom was almost bigger than the bedroom! I will return to this hotel, I am now a lifetime customer. Merci for making us feel at home is Paris Our family stayed here for the Olympics. We were warmly welcomed by the incredible front of house staff, and our young daughter was delighted to find a kids coloring and sticker kit along with a little stuffed animal on her bed. Additionally, it was my husband's birthday and they later surprised us with a thoughtful cake!

During our entire stay the staff were always friendly, accommodating, helpful and we soon felt like we were staying with family. We'd like to personally thank Laurent and Polina at the front desk, all of the restaurant staff and the housekeepers. The hotel was booked full of American foreigners during the August month of French vacation, and everyone was kind and gracious.

We enjoyed breakfast daily and found the buffet to be diverse and delicious. We also dined for lunch twice and greatly enjoyed our meals and the service. While we attempted a little French, luckily most of the staff were polyglots.

The housekeepers took excellent care of tidying our family's mess and making the rooms fresh and clean. They always made sure we had enough water, fresh towels and crisp bedding. Being Paris, we were delighted to have wash clothes, though with the warm nights would have liked a flat sheet also on the bed.

We thought the beds were a bit hard like when in Japan. Having been there nearly two weeks, we started to notice a moist odor with the plumbing near the end. Maybe it was the connected drainage, or maybe the shower needed the caulking refreshed, or maybe the room AC condensation wasn't able to drain away.

We loved the location and the charming style of the hotel and were delighted to have a large balcony overlooking Av. de l'Opra.

It was immensely charming to walk around and explore the neighborhood. The various metro stations were all so very close. There is Little Tokyo nearby, the Louvre Museum, Jardin des Tuileries, Galerie Vivienne, Colonne Vendme and of course Galeries Lafayette Haussmann. Our favorite shops were Pierre Herm and Brentano's.

Of special note of how the staff go above and beyond, Laurent walked my husband and my daughter one night to the best crepes nearby at Chez Suzette so that they wouldn't get lost. Additionally, one of the bellmen also went above and beyond to take us and our luggage to the metro and got it on board in the August heat, ensuring we got all of our things onto the correct train for our departure.

We will look back fondly on our Olympic holiday in Paris at Hotel Edouard VII thanks to the wonderful staff, the beautiful hotel and historic location. We would be very happy to return and would also seek out the other B Signature Hotels. Merci beaucoup. Stayed there four nights, our room was large, bathroom was new, balcony very small.  Location is good. Overall its a nice small city hotel.  Reception area feels cold with ugly lightning. Location was great, easy access to metro, restaurants, cafe's boulangeries, and shopping.  Quick walk to the Opera Garnier and LaFayette Galleria.  Staff were very attentive, readily available to answer all your questions. We were delighted to receive a room upgrade with a great view. Remember Paris hotel rooms can be small. Hotel was immaculate and the bedtime chocolates were yummy! Guests would be fortunate to find a vacancy at this hotel.  A special thank you to Polina and Mathilda for all the individual attention they gave us. The front staff should  also be complimented for their friendliness.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Nouvel Eiffel Hotel - Paris,"5 Rue des Volontaires, 75015 Paris, France",4.1,48.84339500000001,2.3068478,"The hotel is situated in a quiet area, 20 minutes away from the Eiffel Tower and very close to the subway station. The hotel staff is kind and polite. Our room was small, but beautiful, clean and confortable. Breakfast was really good. We had a wonderful trip. We consider returning in the future. A terrific room to come back to at the end of the day and watch TV in bed.  No real room for much else.  Great show.  Everything recently renovated.  They have a lift!!!!! You can see the Eiffel Tower in the distance as you walk from the train station to the hotel. Rooms As most reviews reference, I agree the rooms are small. However, most hotel rooms in Europe are small so this wasn't a large surprise. Rooms could have been kept in better condition. For example, the towel rack had missing screws and the walls were covered with lint and dust from the vent.

Service You are not able to change your thermostat from heat to cool on your own. We had to call the front desk to change it for us. Some were happy to change it and others refused. One night, our room was really hot. I had to ask three separate times, and go down to talk in person before they finally changed it. This was the most frustrating.

I am welltravelled and have never been restricted on air temperature in my own room before.

Location The hotel is a 5 minute walk from two different train stations. Very convenient. Although, there isn't much to see in close proximity. The name is a bit deceiving as there is absolutely no view of the eiffel tower....it is however walking distance from the hotel. The pic I posted is of the view from the room. The rooms are really small. If we were to have carried a large suitcase, there wouldn't have been space for it in the room...thankfully we had a carry on. But also really neat and clean. Pillows aren't comfortable at all. Situation is perfect as it is close to restaurants. The tea station in the room is really welcomed. I recently stayed at this hotel, and it was a terrible experience. The rooms are extremely tight and small, regardless of which one you choose. The staff, especially the woman at the front desk  manager, is incredibly rude, hostile, and difficult to understand. She doesn't care about customers' complaints at all. The elevator is a joke, barely fitting two people. Overall, this hotel fails in both service and comfort. Avoid it at all costs!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 12:00 AM

citizenM Paris Champs Elysées hotel,"128 Rue La Boétie, 75008 Paris, France",4.6,48.8709368,2.3057987,"I stayed here for a month during the Olympics, it was fantastic. The staff were so friendly, they couldnt have been more helpful if they tried they welcomed you every morning with a smile and most remembered your coffee order 
There was a great international feel to the place, very warm and very welcoming. The location was spectacular, a literal stones throw from one of the most famous streets in the world, so it was very easy to get around Paris based there.
There was a roof top terrace that was for guests only, that was nice, and if you sit in the right spot, you can see the Eiffel Tower lighting up the sky at night.
I will say though, the rooms were quite smallthey dont hide this fact, so 2 people is the absolute MAX that could share the room, but best suited to a solo traveller in my opinion. Also, and its only minor, the windows in the rooms dont open. Even though Pairs was hot, it would have been nice to get some fresh outside air in the room. This is only a tiny critique otherwise the place was fab! Highly recommend Stayed here 2 nights. Loved that the staff spoke English, all were smiling and friendly. Our airline lost our luggage and they were helpful to temporarily replace basic items for us. Loved the tech in the room and really loved the King bed, AC, and blackout blinds. The room was small but didnt feel like we needed it any bigger since we werent there majority of the time. Location was great, too. Really enjoyed it and would totally recommend to a friend. Second Citizen M booking. Really like this chain, the rooms a modern and clean and the tech works well. Breakfast was great. Staff was friendly. Roof top bar was a plus.

Location is just off the Champs Elysees so well located for Arc de Triumph and the metro. The location of the hotel was great, the hotel itself was clean and it seems like it was recently renovated. Staff were very kind and helpful. 2 issues I had and the reason why I took one star off are 1 the room we stayed in was sooooo small and I believe this is the smallest room they had, and we knew that, just didnt expect it to be this small. The sink is literally 2 feet from the bed. Beds however were big and comfortable.
2 I wouldve really liked it if they had a coffee maker in the room or at least offer a complementary free coffee per person room in the lobby. I had to pay I think 4 euros a day for regular American coffee and milk. Wouldve been nice if we at least had a little coffee maker in the room and we can make our own coffee. Very successful Low Cost hotel on digitalizing everything but customer satisfaction. Like not being to able set room temperature over 24 C even at cold nights or having rooms soft cleaned with minimal effort. Stubborn staff is very capable providing same negative answers with consistency. What i can suggest is the location.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Touring Hotel,"21 Rue Buffault, 75009 Paris, France",4.2,48.87612490000001,2.3420383,"The hotel is in very convenient location. The Metro station is just on the corner. La Fayette shopping mall is in few minutes walking distance. There are many choices for having food in surrounded area.
The room is bigger than we expected and comfortable.
The staffs are very friendly and willing to have conversations with us by English. A great hotel in the heart of Paris. I can't say that the hotel is very gorgeous honestly, but its room and price are worth staying. I booked the room with a bundle deal with Eurostar, so I don't know how much the hotel price was exactly, but it seems to be around 130 EUR. This is a quite reasonable price considering its location and a season which is during Olympic Games 2024!
A room was tidy but not spacious. Two single beds were in the room, but still there is room to open my suitcase. Bathroom was a little old but wellcleaned.
One thing I need to mention was when you want to turn on AC, you need to contact to the reception. There is a remote on the wall in the room, but it won't work until asking the reception. Plus, please note that there is no fridge in the room.
I didn't see restaurant in the hotel, but there are many restaurants which open until midnight around the hotel. You don't have to worry about finding a place to eat!
The biggest thing I need to add here was a kindness of the staff called Patrick A man from Mauritius. He helped us a lot when checking inout. He showed a map of Paris and explained thoroughly. Also, he gave a small bag for us with a logo of the hotel. Very friendly staff I have ever seen. Again, it is not a gorgeous hotel but somehow it made us feel to come back again soon. It was a wonderful experience staying at the Touring Hotel for our week long stay with our family.

Location
It was very close to metro stations and a 20 minute walk to the RER station.  The 7 line station which is a 3 minute walk away also goes to the RER for those wanting to go to Disney Land Paris.  There are also a ton of restaurants and bakeries nearby within walking distance so finding food is never a problem.  There are even 2 small grocery shops close by.

Rooms
Beds were comfortable, there was cleaning service everyday and they refilled the soaps everyday so it was very convenient.  Air conditioning doesn't work though but it is easily remedied by opening the windows. Rooms were definitely dated but has a unique charm.

Service
The hosts were very professional and accommodating to English speakers.  The standout host was Isabella.  She was very warm and kind and went above and beyond in customer service.  She gave us helpful tips to visit in the area for the first day we were there and also answered any questions we had.  She also hosted the breakfast and while simple, kept it very clean and full of delicious food.  Isabella had made our stay very comfortable and if I ever come back to Paris I will come back to this hotel.

Overall, a great hotel to stay at if you are a tourist staying in Paris. Great location. Near metro. Very quiet. Clean. Breakfast good, not on Sunday. Restaurant nearby. Great hotel! Last minute booking and the hotel turned out better than expected. The owner was very kind and accommodating! Definitely recommend!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel Montaigne,"6 Av. Montaigne, 75008 Paris, France",4.1,48.8655164,2.3038653,"I enjoyed just about everything about this hotel. Cozy, clean and great location. Although it comes at a price its one of the expensive hotels in Paris. We had very pleasent days at the Montaigne Hotel
The design of the recepciom the bar and cafe are so exquisit that you love to stay in.The rooms are very confortable , not too big but very charming. The bed and the  mttress also very confortable to rest . And special mention deserves Ms Cloe at the Fron Desk and Recepction , very Helpfull
The location of the Montaigne could not be better
Jorge and Noemi Great place to stay in the heart of the city.

Rooms are clean and service is great. Its great to just walk around as many main attractions are just around the corner.

The rooms are cozy and affordable for the location. We were really extremely satisfied in this beatiful hotel. Very kind staff, very helpful. We will definitely come back by our next stay in Paris. It was the worst experience in Paris. Our windows were facing other room windows. From the restaurant you can clearly see our toilet room NO PRIVACY. Even the curtains are so thin that you can see everything. But worst is shower experience. Its combined together with toilet. So after taking shower you cant use toilet. And there is no wardrobe in the room.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Le Burgundy Paris,"6-8 Rue Duphot, 75001 Paris, France",4.6,48.8679751,2.3258952,"This hotel offers truly exceptional service! Generous and thoughtful staff throughout the hotel including at the wonderful restaurant. Beautiful, calm pool great for adults as well as children, fancy spa, lovely environment throughout. The neighborhood is extremely safe and calm as well Celine right across the street and the best stores a few yards away! We had the best experience at the hotel. All of the staff were kind and helpful. The room was clean and large. It has an amazing location. And the food was very good as well. We would absolutely stay here again. We stayed there in August and it was wonderful! The location is perfect  the side street is quiet but still super close to a metro stop, Vendme, and shopping on St Honore. Easy walk to Louvre, Opera house, Galeries Lafayette, etc.  even Musee DOrsay.

We chose a junior suite and it was terrific. Its not massive but well laid out and quiet.

Wellappointed room with lots of nice details  welcome treats, daily complimentary water, juice and soda refills, converter, etc. and evening turn down service if you want it.

The pool is not big didnt think it would or needed to be but really relaxing and a nice treat if you are hot after a long day or have kids. Didnt try the spa but its there if you want it.

Hotel seemed busy but never noisy and even a full elevator.

Nice breakfast a continental spread with made to order eggs and sides  not amazing but ours was includedfree so really no complaints.

Super nice and welcoming staff  from front desk to wait staff, everyone was pleasant, helpful and warm. Bar restaurant service was quick yet attentive.

Highly recommend! My lovely bride and I stayed at Le Burgundy for a week in May 2024, and our stay was nothing short of fabulous. We stayed in a lovely room on the third floor overlooking Rue Duphot, around the corner from Rue SaintHonor. We love to hear the sounds of a Parisian street from our hotel room! The location is unbeatable, and it is only one block from the Metro Station, Madeleine. The service easily deserves five stars throughout the doormen, front desk, room cleaning, room service, and of course the Michelinstarred restaurant, Le Baudelaire. My bride and I rarely stay twice in the same hotel, but this is one that we will definitely return to as often as possible. Highly recommended! Stayed in early June. Their classic room was comfortable for two with enough space to have two suitcases open. The room was well appointed with all the conveniences of a luxury hotel free beverages, turn down service, concierge. I especially appreciated it's location which was on a quiet street yet close enough to a large number of sights.
Special mention goes to their friendly door staff.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hotel Montalembert,"3 Rue de Montalembert, 75007 Paris, France",4.7,48.8567203,2.3278538,"This is such an amazing hotel, having traveled to Paris a few times, this is by far my favorite hotel. The service is incredible,  every single staff member we engaged with were extremely friendly and so helpful for any questions we had. For me the outstanding factor was housekeeping,  and their immaculate cleaning, and making sure every single amenity is replaced every day. Every day when we returned back to the hotel the room was spotless.  Such a great location too, you almost have the best of both worlds location and peace and quiet. I truly would highly recommend this hotel, and personally I'll be staying here again when we come back. Prepare to be wowd! Our hotel experience was wonderful here. The front desk service was impeccable. The room size and furnishings were wonderful. The neighborhood feels safe and was beautiful in the spring. I would stay here time and time again and plan on telling anyone who may visit to stay here as well! I am attaching photos of gorgeous floral arrangements and how spacious the marble bathroom was. WOW!! Wow. This hotel is just perfection. I had read about it online, and so when looking for a hotel on the left bank, I remembered hearing amazing things.

First, the location is spectacular. Right in the heart of the left bank within walking distance to anything your heart desires  restaurants, shopping, bars, grocery stores, late night eats  everything!

What truly stood out was the exceptional level of service and attention to detail. Pschemick I absolutely butchered the spelling of his name! was an incredible host, bringing up our luggage, showing us to our room and all the amenities, helping us with our cabs, and always greeting us with a smile.

Upone arrival to our gorgeous suite, we were greeted with a bottle of champagne !! and La Dure macarons which was absolutely so unexpected and just lovely. Talk about exception service!!

The room we stayed was beautifully decorated, wellappointed, comfortable, and laid out perfectly for two people. We loved the sitting room, the bathrooms toilette separate from the shower  especially the showerbath combo, the furniture, the beds  literally everything.

I cannot recommend this hotel enough to anyone wanting a beautiful hotel on the left bank. This will absolutely be our goto hotel whenever we are lucky enough to find ourselves in Paris.

STAY HERE AND ENJOY!!! Absolutely top notch. I had to move to the right bank as I had prebooked another hotel, and I am really sorry I had to leave the Montalembert. The staff are marvelous, the hotel is lovely, the location is superb! They even gave me a birthday treat and I dont think I had told anyone at the hotel that it was my birthday. At my new hotel, I mentioned it was my birthday, and they were like, Thats nice. From now on  ONLY the  Montalembert. The best!! 5 star hotel with fantastic service centrally located with a neighborhood feel. Our 5 night stay was exceptional from booking through checkout. The room was clean, comfortable, and had a balcony to let in the Parisian nighttime breeze. Would recommend for the traveler who wants to be within walking distance of most sightseeing attractions.","Monday: Open 24 hours

La Maison Favart,"5 Rue de Marivaux, 75002 Paris, France",4.6,48.8708104,2.3373092,"A perfect location, overlooking the Opera plaza. A delightful hotel offering comfortable rooms and good breakfasts. The staff are all very helpful. Rooms are small as in many Parisian hotels. Pillows are not featherdown and not very comfortable though bed is good.  Good value. If you are looking for a boutique Parisian hotel with exceptional service in a central location, look no further!

My family of four spent four lovely nights at La Maison Favart on our first visit to Paris.

The hotel is charming and central to all things  20 minute walk to the Louvre.

We had two rooms facing the opera and it was so lovely to be able to open the windows. The rooms were pretty small, as expected in Paris, so we opted for two.

For our first visit we wanted a hotel that could help us navigate the city, restaurants and tours. The staff at La Maison Favart were exceptional, especially Boris and Freddie! Boris went out of his way to find a fun pub for us to watch the Euros  to be in Paris as the French team won was just fantastic!

Great stay all around. Thank you La Maison Favart! My husband and I throughly enjoyed our stay here.

It was a very last minute honeymoon trip so we didnt have much time to prepare. For this reason, we had to make several requests to the hotel. Thankfully, they were incredibly kind and accommodating and made sure that we were comfortable throughout our stay.

I was very impressed with the service and attention to detail  they clearly do their best to get to know and accommodate all of their guests.

The bedroom was clean and well resourced, the view was absolutely incredible we were able to take some amazing pictures!. The bathroom was beautiful and had an incredible shower.

On top of this, the location was absolutely perfect. Everything we needed was within walking distance. The area felt incredibly safe and we could walk around at night with ease.

Our experience was a 1010. If youre thinking of booking here please do! If I could give this hotel negative stars, I would.  Appalling, Executive summary  stay elsewhere.

I stayed here as our small group tour had selected this hotel.  Based on reviews I stayed independent of the group two extra nights prior to the tour.

Firstly, a general commentary.  The rooms are smallish not the worst you'll find in Paris though! and the showers are great!  A decent flow of hot water was fabulous.

The towels are out of this world!  The best towels I've every experienced.  Thick and soft, I'd love to buy some!

It's an old hotel and the single lift is slow.  Best to take the stairs if you're body is able.

Breakfast is a small offering and I was disappointed to learn it had been highlighted with our group manager that we had arrived early for breakfast and the staff were not happy.  The problem with this is twofold  it wasn't anyone on our group that did this.  And in fact, on this day, I arrived about 15 minutes after breakfast was supposed to have started to very little food having been put out.  Still by the time I left not all food had been supplied and there were ice bricks waiting in their place.  This was about 45 mins after breakfast was supposed to have started.

The central heating is also problematic.  Rooms do not have individual temperature controls so I find it gets quite hot.  I'd happily open the window but due to noise see below that's not an option.  In addition to the massive issues detailed below even on a 'good' night you have people calling out throughout the square etc there are a couple of homeless people that seem to use it too which kept others awake until they closed their windows.

Now the major issue.  Noise.

There is a public square across the road.  On my first evening at the hotel I checked in and was told absolutely nothing about this  however, there was a commercialmovie being filmed in this square and it started in the early evening and did not finish until 5am.  Having had no sleep I was grateful that it had finally ended.  But no, the noise continued with trucks reversing and beeping as they dismantled the set for several more hours.

Now upon my return visit it is a wedding reception.  Guests started arriving around 7pm and at 345am I am writing this review, once again with no sleep and once again with an abundance of noise coming from this square.  People are drinking and loudly chatting on the street immediately in front of the hotel, not inside the marquee though the piano is still getting a workout, possibly by guests, as a poor level of music is being performed eg Chopsticks.

This is an expensive hotel and for this price point there are many superior hotels to stay in.  Choose another one.

What is most disappointing is that on both occasions the hotel did not inform me.  They could have offered ear plugs, a reduced rate, a free drink etc.  Nothing.  Why on earth anyone would pay full price to have no sleep I do not know.  Who wants to walk around Paris like a zombie?

For it to have happened twice it must be a regular occurrence.  I did mention it to hotel staff when I saw the marquee being set up yesterday to which I was told it wouldn't bother me as there are many neighbours and people using the square are not allowed to make noise.  When I mentioned that it had kept me away only two weeks ago he replied, ""I'll inform my colleague.""

As you may imagine, that was the last I heard of it and I'm having my second sleepless night in Fauvart.

Truly, stay elsewhere.  Paris is full of marvellous options, this isn't one of them.

Photo taken at 330am. Finally finished at 345am. Its now 605am and theyve been dismantling for the past 2 hours and 20 mins, banging and crashing and yelling the whole time. Helpful and friendly staff. Rooms are nice and clean. Updated bathrooms are welcome. Mid afternoon cake and snacks are great addition. Location is perfect  can walk to restaurants, train, groceries in a few minutes. The area felt safe. Again shout out to the staff members who are really helpful.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hotel Residence des Arts,"14 Rue Gît-le-Cœur, 75006 Paris, France",4.5,48.8534809,2.3423504,"We had an amazing time in Paris and a big part of it was due to our lodging. This hotel is not only cute but in the perfect location. We were able to walk or take public transportation to all the major tourist attractions while also seeing some of the real every day parts and places of Paris. They were able to have our room ready early which was a nice surprise. We arranged flowers, champagne, and chocolates in our room at welcome for our anniversary and the they displayed them in our room beautifully. The flowers were gorgeous and the champagne and chocolates were some of the best I have ever had. They provided us with recommended restaurants and we had some of the best meals because of the list! They staff were very helpful with sharing their recommendations for places to go and see in the area. The room was a very nice size easy to move around. Loved having the window open and listening to the sounds of Paris while we were in the room. This is definitely more of a romantic or boutique hotel but so worth it. When my husband and I are lucky enough to come back to Paris again we will stay here! The location is terrific, surrounded by terrific Parisian and world foods, great access to Metro, Seine, Notre Dame and other landmarks, but also laundry great for the longterm traveler. The staff was very friendly and housekeeping was excellent. I loved just sitting in the window bay enjoying the view of the nightlife below. The rooms are spacious enough, especially considering they are in the heart of the city. There was even an efficiency kitchen. I just wish they had more outlets! First  star rating in Paris relates to the facilities not the quality like in North America.

Second  it is in a fantastic location in an older section of Paris where many of the major sites are walking distance.  It has very good RER and Metro access to numerous lines within a 3 min walk.  A TON of great places to eat close by.

Third  clean, no bugs.

Fourth  had an elevator.  Worlds smallest, but it worked think 3 large suitcases wide by 1 deep.  Claustrophobic people will not be able to use it.

Fifth  people were friendly, polite and very professional.  Was safe and secure. From arrival to departure the hotel visit was excellent. We were greeted and checked in as soon as we arrived and were taken to our room so we could freshen up before heading out for food well before checkin time. The room was very comfortable with a place for everything, very comfortable bed, closet and fantastic water pressure. The location could not be better for walking and dining. Easy access to the Metro and RER. Highly recommended for friendly staff and location. Well return. We loved this hotel! It is close to everything, very comfortable and clean, and there are several restaurants around. The team, particularly Willy, was always so helpful and friendly! We would recommend this hotel to anyone, and we would stay again when visiting Paris.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hotel Terminus Orleans,"197 Boulevard Brune, 75014 Paris, France",4.3,48.82359580000001,2.3247521,"We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and it was more than enough! Staff was very nice and helpful, hotel is located right next to metro station so its very easy and convenient to get to the city center, price was really good less than 450! They clean up your room and exchange towels if needed every day! I definitely recommend this place  I recently stayed 5 nights in this hotel and couldn't be better. I booked a single room with private bathroom.

The staff in reception is super helpful and friendly, the all speak english so that was nice and one of them even explained to me the public transportation system so I could use it without problems.

The hotel is far from the center of the city but metro stations and bus stops are just a few steps away from the hotel.

Best choice for the price. I definitely recommend it Location wise an awesome place to soak in the Parisian environment, culture  pulse of the city. What makes it exceptional is the cleanliness of the hotel, staff's helpful attitude  proximity to transport. Small rooms, but extremely clean  decor is just right! Will stay again at this place on next visit.. We stayed there for one week. Great location, near public transit of all kinds. Service was overall very good, but it depended on who was at the desk. Breakfast person was especially attentive. A few minor issues with the room, such as the variable number of towels and the lack of USB chargers in the wall. But over quite satisfied. Out of all the hotels in Paris, beware of Hotel Terminus Orleans. I am a fair reviewer, but the customer service here is poor and the staff are not trained to answer questions in an efficient manner.  Save yourself the headache and book elsewhere. Trust me, your Parisian adventure deserves better than Hotel Terminus Orleans.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hôtel de Saint Germain - Saint-Germain des Près,"50 Rue du Four, 75006 Paris, France",3.4,48.8523461,2.3306947,"All in all a terrible hotel. The service is a disaster and the hotel room was full of mould. I stayed there last year in December. As soon as we arrived we noticed that the entire wall in the room behind the curtains was full of black mould. Something like this should actually be noticed when the room is cleaned, a clear indication that it is not cleaned thoroughly. There was no other hotel room available so we had to take another hotel . We were promised that we would be paid for the transfer to the new hotel, but this never happened. You simply don't get an answer to queries. There are so many hotels in Paris, this one is definitely not recommended! Small hotel in a convenient part of the city. The rooms are clean and well looked after. Bed was very comfortable. Its noisy though and you can hear people in the other rooms so no wild sex. I would recommend for a single person or couple traveling thru for a few nights. Not recommended for families. It's a 2 star hotel in the middle of Paris. The rooms are small but everything you need is there. The only problem is you can feel the Metro  the room literally vibrates. At least the metro stops at night. The walls are also quite thin so you can hear some people. However the rooms are clean and they give you a nice welcome treat plus water. Hair dryer is available, and lots of towels too. Good location 3 min walk from the Metro Saint Sulpice and and surrounded by good food places. Rating the rooms 3 because of said problems above. The location is perfect for getting around Paris. Very close to a few metro stops. Our rooms were small but that's the standard in Paris where space is limited. The rooms were clean and had everything we needed. We loved that the rooms were energy efficient. The rooms are noisy you can hear the metro pass every 5 mins until Abt 2am. If you're a light sleeper, even with the earplugs they give you it may not be the best sleep you've ever had. We stayed on the 3rd floor, with earplugs our sleep was okay. The breakfast is very simplewhich I believe may be a culture thing in Paris  so don't expect a US type of continental breakfast. It was included in my stay so I don't know how much it cost separate but do see my photos so you know what Breakfast includes and you can decide if it's worth the pricetag. Breakfast also finishes early and when it's quota for the day is done it's doneso there's  no more bread deli meats even if you askso you definitely need to come down for breakfast before 8830am or you may not get a lot to eat. We loved the freshfruit salad on mornings. The reception staff was always welcoming and very helpful with directions. Check in and check out was very quick and hassle free. Our room had a small balcony with a city view 
This 6th arrondissement location is very safe we roamed around late at night and felt very safe.  The location is perfect for accessing bistros on the nearby Rue de Rennes or walking to the Latin quarter for souvenir shopscreperies.
Very close patisserieboulangeries nearby.
We would definitely stay here again when in Paris It's an OK place for a two star hotel. Everything's a bit tiny... there may be some noise they'll give you earplugs and the building's shaking a bit when the metro trains pass... currently extremely overpriced, but that's true for all of Paris.  Airconditioning worked well and it was relatively clean...","Monday: Open 24 hours

Aparthotel Adagio Access Paris Clichy,"19-23 Av. Anatole France, 92110 Clichy, France",3.7,48.8987287,2.3035147,"Torn between 1 start or 2. Would give 1.5 if I could. Its a ten minute walk from the metro, and then from there its 30 minutes to get to the most popular areas, and thats after 1, 2 or even 3 changes. As for the hotel itself, its not a hotel in the slightest. They are completely self catered apartments. No sheet changes or towel changes. You have to go downstairs to request bin liners and toilet roll. You even have to take your own garbage into the garbage room. The included breakfast is completely basic, and once breakfast closes you cannot go back into the room. The room.. the room is probably the worst arranged room in the sense of where everything is. The plug sockets are placed in stupid positions, the toilet had no sink in it. So you would finish and then have to touch the handle to get out, and then the handle to get into the shower room to wash your hands. Very gross, especially when youre sharing with other people. Then we turn to the staff. The cleaner was absolutely awful person. No class, very arrogant and needs to be put in her place. She refused a mother with two young kids travelling with us from taking snacks upstairs and from using the communal toilets. Some of the receptionists couldnt even speak English, which is a basic requirement in the hotel industry, particularly in Europe. Some of them were also very arrogant too, which explains why theyre working in this place as opposed to the more established, classier places. Cant fault them all though, some of the staff were helpful and are the sole reason Id give a 1.5 rating During my stay, one of the good thing is the location of the hotel, is near to one of 341's bus stop.

But room condition is quite bad, air conditioner is not working well, is quite hot at night, even after complaining to the receptionist, the room temperature still hot, and also some of the bed sheet and pillow sheet smells mouldymusty. 6 out of 10, the location help the rating. I enjoyed my time at the Adagio in Clichy. My room was great! Very clean, and very large. The underground car park was terrible!!! But Ive got to be honest.. it was great seeing my friend Paul trying to reverse out of the carpark under pressure while being watched the whole Seat Renew crew at 6 in the morning. Very stressful but very funny!! My favourite receptionist was Fanny, she was genuine, she was beautiful, she had a strong handshake, and looked me dead in the eye while shaking my hand not common. It would be a loss for any company to let her go.

Sam. DO NOT BOOK!!!! I would give this 0 stars if I could. Most importantly, the first day of our booking we were told to make a deposit of approximately 98. KEEP IN MIND that the counter lady said it would automatically get sent back into my account on the final day of our booking and it did not!!! Its been a month and there has not been a payment refunded into my account, I stayed from the 5th july to the 9th and thought it was just a mistake and i would receive it until the end of the month, however i still have not. The toilet itself doesnt have a lock and the toilet is in one room and the sink and shower is in another, meaning you would have to do your business and touch both door handles to finally wash your hands, so it isnt ideally hygienic. Furthermore, the towels wouldnt get changed throughout the stay and rooms wouldnt get cleaned throughout the stay either. Will definitely not be booking and have told all friends and family members about this hotel! scamming the deposit money while being lied to and being told that i would receive the payment on the final day, yet i havent!!!! I would like to share an extremely disappointing experience I had when making a reservation at another hotel within the Adagio group, specifically at the Aparthotel Adagio Porte de Versailles.
I believe it is important that all hotels in the Adagio group are aware of this situation to prevent similar issues in the future.On March 21, 2024, I made an online reservation directly through the official Adagio website for a stay in June. During the payment process, the official adagio website encountered an error, resulting in multiple attempts to make the reservation. Although I did not receive immediate confirmation, I was later charged for two reservations NGCLGWDZ and NGCLBCPF.
When I tried to resolve the issue in person, I was met with indifference by the hotel management. The manager, Emma Corny, was extremely unpleasant and suggested that the responsibility for the error was entirely mine, refusing to offer any solution or refund. Moreover, I never received any document or invoice for the duplicate reservation that I was charged for but did not use, which I consider a serious lack of transparency and service.
I consider this practice abusive, especially with nonrefundable reservations, and I am determined to ensure that other guests do not face the same frustration. Therefore, I am sharing this experience with all Adagio group hotels here on TripAdvisor, hoping that steps will be taken to avoid such issues in the future.If you are considering staying at any hotel in the Adagio group, I recommend caution when making your reservation, especially if it is nonrefundable. Be aware to avoid situations like the one I experienced.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hôtel Berne Opéra,"37 Rue de Berne, 75008 Paris, France",4.2,48.881892,2.3221681,"Nice little hotel at a decent location. The best thing about the hotel is it's fantastic staff... Louisa and Isabelle both ensured we had a pleasant stay and were very prompt to attend to some minor issues we identified.

Recommended. Hard to beat this location.  We got there on public transit from CDG, no problems, only 100 m from the nearest metro and we walked to Gare St Lazar for day trips out of the city.

This location is in a ""Real Paris neighbourhood""   Yet you can walk to the Moulin Rouge and the Arch D' Triumph.

A charming hotel that is in an old building that is gently rough on the edges but this in my opinion adds to the authentic charm.  The beds were cozy and comfortable and yes, they do have AC. 1. The location is convenient. Around 15 minutes' walk from the montmatre and the opera. However the neighbourhood feels a bit dead, especially at night.
2. The room is small and does not feel clean. The room smells bad and the bathroom looks so sketchy that i do not want to use it.
3. AC at my room is not working.
4. All staffs at the counter are very helpful, friendly  and polite.
5. Overall, it is an ok stay considering its price and location. had a cancelled flight, the staff prepared a 7 person accomodation in few minutes.
Very gentle and professional people, clean rooms, great breakfast.

1010 would return My mom and I thought our room was very cute and cozy. It was just what we needed considering we were spending the majority of our time outside of the hotel. Also, we were lucky to get two balconys in our room so taking pictures there was a plus! Only thing I would change is that our bathroom was a bit outdated.","Monday: Open 24 hours

We forgot a Shirt in the hotel room and after one email the staff sent it to us back in Germany. We are so thankful for your fast response Hotel Maison du Pr. We will be definitely back soon Decent small hotel if you if you are in the look out for a basic  clean room close to Gare du Nord.

The decor is dated and the walls are not the most sound proof in the word, but they are clean and have the basics. So ideal if you are not looking to spend most of the day in the hotel The hotel has pleasant staff, comfortable beds, and a good location, and a lovely old Parisian feel. However, when it rains the drains absolutely stink, and when the necessaries are so tiny that's quite overwhelming! We recommend Jim's Corner nearby for breakfast. Things we liked
 Room Cleaning Service,
 Hotel is in walkable distance from subway, bakeries, train station.

Things we didnt like
 City Tax wasnt included in the total price  making the check out unpleasant experience.
 Had to give the room key back every time we would need to leave the hotel.
 The receptionists were not friendly, indifferent, unwelcoming.

Things we would appreciate
 Recommendations about places to visit close to hotels, services available at the hotel with price list, things to be aware for tourists using public transportation.

Overall, it was one of a few affordable hotels as the prices in Paris are absolutely insane. Elsewhere, for the same money, we would get a way better service, way better room and view. Didnt have any view, we barely had a window looking at nowhere. Very clean. It's a couple of miles to the opera house. The museums and eiffle Tower are across town. It's close to an  RER station .  The front desk guy at night was super rude about making us leave the hotel room key whenever we went out. He got in a huge fight with our driver to the airport. I booked a car service to and from the hotel before I went to Paris. When the driver came in and helped us with our luggage, he yelled at him and told him he had to take another couple because they called a taxi first. It went on for about 5 minutes yelling in French waving some paper at the driver. The elevator is small and terrifying. So, we used the scary spiral staircase. The room was tiny, and the shower had no door or curtain, so the entire bathroom was flooded after your shower. Only one plug on by the night stand. We won't be back or ever stay in a 3star hotel again.  Oh, and if you stay, visit the st Vincent de Paul church a couple blocks away. Go after 3 and you can tour the inside for free.

Hôtel Montpensier,"12 Rue de Richelieu, 75001 Paris, France",3.9,48.8643329,2.3363307,"Exceeded expectations. Very clean and comfy room. Spacious quad sharing room. Room and bathroom equipped with all the basic things youll need. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Had an old school lift, those you see in old European buildings. Thought it added charm. Great location, 2 min walk to Palais Royal, 5 minutes to the Louvre, plenty of restaurants nearby. Its not a big brand and they dont claim to be luxury so dont expect it to be fancy. Its a great value for money, would stay here again. I was a bit apprehensive at first due to a few of the critical reviews here, but my experience was great. For the price, you really can't get a hotel at such an amazing location. The service was good, they are quite helpful especially when it come to luggage storage. Allowed me store my luggage before and after check in. Location wise, you have great restaurants near by, all top class! The ramen restaurant right beside the hotel is always full. A tip, ask for rooms in the higher floors which would mitigate the street noise. Yes, the elevator is small, but personally I was affected. Rooms were decent, same goes for the toilet. I'd certainly comeback here when I visit Paris next. I was a little worried about what to expect from 2 stars, but in the end I really liked the hotel. Maybe it is not spectacular here, but the atmosphere somehow matches real life the center of Paris  and yes, the location is really great. What I have to especially appreciate is the helpful and kind staff. We received abovestandard care at the reception. Thank you very much  we would love to come back again The room was clean but very small for 2 beds. The bathroom is awkwardly tiny and would be a challenge for large or tall people. The elevator is an old cage lift. Charming but a little slow and rickety, I took the stairs.

The ramen place next door must be really good or trendy, as there was a line of about 30 people waiting outside. However, I did not try it out.

Overall, the place is reasonable and feels safe. It is a bit spooky Wonderful spot to sleep while in Paris. Louvre very close! Two subway stations very close. Many delightful coffee and dining spots also close by. Rather quiet for a downtown city street. Smallish rooms  but location saves the day!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hôtel La Canopée,"15 Rue de Penthièvre, 75008 Paris, France",4.6,48.87290360000001,2.3164937,"Had an amazing time! This was my first time in Paris, and I would absolutely stay here again anytime I come. The room was very cute, and the bed was very comfy. The owners and staff are incredibly sweet and helpful. Would recommend to anyone!! Fantastic location! The staff was phenomenal and helped us out a ton. The room was quaint and perfect for our needs. Will definitely be staying here again next time Im in Paris! The staff is mostly nice, 25 room, 3 star, no frills hotel. You get small rooms, however standard for Europe.

Pros  Tiny elevator, but there is one, and Air conditioning variable coolness but can be set to 19 degree celcius
Cons  no slippers in the rooms, no irons either, you can access iron in the basement

No beverages  anything extra is for sale, there is a coffeecocoa machine downstairs and for 4 euros you can get a 6oz beverage. Or just go to coffee shop down the street for a 16oz.

Extras  Washerdryer in basement, 5 euros per load, per appliance.

Neighbourhood  safe, 4 minute walk to Miromesnil, no attractions in the area, so you will need to go to the center for dinners, shopping etc. It is a quick hop and a skip, so no issues.

ATTENTION to saving money I booked 3 months in advance for a 6 day stay, and it cost 30 more  400 euros  500 than my friend who booked the same week. So you should do the  variable fare if you need to stay here, then check the week of your stay and cancel then rebook to optimize your bang for your buck!  My fault for skipping out on that, lost money for an equivalent, no frills stay 1. Kettle in my room is horribly dirty, so I told the reception and got the one they use in the common canteen. Don't know if the original one in my room gets clean or changed

2. Towels are dirty, there're dirty spots on towels. It says only used towels on floor will be brought to clean, so I put all of them on floor in case they don't clean for next customer. Thank God I bring all my own towels.

3. Lift in hotel acts very weird on May 25th around 3am. The lift doesn't go upstairs even after I swiped my room key card. It went up to 1st floor and stopped moving. Then I pressed the emergency bell, It says hold 5 seconds to be answered. There was nobody answering the emergency call at all even I have tried 34 times. So the lift went straight down to 1 floor. I've tried to press all the available buttons none of them worked.

4. Things happened again when I'm about to check out on May 25th around 6am. The lift door cannot be closed for 34 times at least. There was nothing being stucked or stopped the door to be closed. I thought of the weird thing happened on me already once so I decided to leave the lift straight away

5. I went back to room and planned to use the phone call provided in every room. The phone call doesn't work either when I followed the instruction to dial 9 to call reception. So I could only fine hotel number on Google map and call them to come upstairs to help me move my luggage. The lift became normal when the receptionist showed up with me.

6. Overall, the experience is from 5 stars going straight down to 0. It is absolutely terrible experience. Everything like towels can be comprised but not safety. Great boutique hotel. Friendly and helpful staff at the front desk. Quiet with super comfortable beds and a great location! Would absolutely recommend.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Relais du Pré,"16 Rue Pierre Semard, 75009 Paris, France",4.1,48.8779914,2.3475742,"A pleasant hotel near the Gard du Nord. Basic facilities in each room, including kettle, towels, and soap. But there was no complementary water and the tea was not replaced during the stay.
Most days the service was ok, but on the last night the porter was rude and then on check out insisted I pay more than what was agreed. I had to get a manager to reduce the price. All this while waiting to go to the airport!
Didn't have breakfast there, The location is super convenient if you're traveling to or from Gare du Nord. There are walkable restaurants and wine bars and you're outside of the tourist part of the city so things are a little more quiet and quaint. The biggest downside are the showers are not able to be stood inside of. At least the one we had was just a tub with a detachable shower head at your hip. 4 Stars is fitting rating in my opinion. First of all for a weekend trip this hotel ist convenient. It's very Close to the Gare du Nord where all the international trains from belgium, the UK and Germany arrive. It takes 1525 mins of walking to the City Center notre Dame, Louvre etc and 5mins to Montmartre. The 9th Arrondissement is great, lots of Shops, Bars and restaurants but not as crowded and very pretty. The rooms are small and a little old but fine as you will not spend a lot of time there anyways. Ours was pretty clean though and even had a small balcony with a pretty view. The bathroom is not great, the shower is tiny and taking a shower while Standing Up is nearly impossible. Also the bathroom will be flooded afterwards. Another thing to keep in mind is that it's and old building with rooms Up to the sixth floor without Air conditioning which was fine in May but I Imagine it could be getting pretty hot in the summer months. The service and staff was great though, very friendly and helpful at all times, they speak english fluently and the female chef also speaks german. The breakfast was alright but when in Paris, I would recommend to skip and and try all the wonderful bakeries instead. What a lovely quaint little hotel with super helpful and friendly staff. You get what you pay for and this is reflected in the price. Rooms are cleaned to a very high standard  inside and out. Good lighting in room we had a triple room with 3 single beds we were only 2  . The bathroom  is lovely and bright well stocked with towels and toiletries.  Has a small walk out balcony with a view of the residence opposite and a bridge , I like this area as it holds old Paris charm, very close to the Gare de Nord Station about 56 mins walk depending on your speed. With lots of restaurants,  shops, Bakeries and much more on the way. The is no AC  but there was a high powered Dyson fan in the room that sufficed well. The mini hot drinks Station is useful. Lots of mirrors  in the room. We only stayed 1 night and this hotel was perfect  for our short visit to Paris. Bouns is you can walk to some places of interest and the metro is like 5 mins walk away . We will definitely consider coming back here again. We enjoyed our stay here!  The staff is very friendly and helpful!  They were able to make a dinner reservation and schedule a taxi for us!  The rooms are small, but not cramped.  I feel like this is probably typical for a Paris hotel room.  This hotel is a great option at a great price.  It doesnt have AC but lucky for us the weather was cool the time we were here.  My single and only issue, the beds are FIRM. Very firm!  Like so firm that whatever side I was laying started to hurt after a short while.  So I tossed and turned all night and Im very tired after 4 nights.  Location is convenient lots of restaurants to walk to in a short amount of time.   If the beds here were more comfortable Id give them 5, stars.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hotel Regina Louvre,"2 Pl. des Pyramides, 75001 Paris, France",4.3,48.86386539999999,2.3325488,"Great Rooms. Clean and all furnishings perfect. Room service was on point and the general service across the hotel was top notch. A beautiful lobby and while mostly an empty restaurant when we were there the room service food was always very good.

I have to say the service was outstanding. I noted ahead we would be early and the room was ready for us when we arrived.

I cannot thank enough nor  praise enough the concierge team. They were incredibly helpful and quick in  tracking down some wine.

Yes, the hotel is under construction and that does unfortunately mean there is a good bit of noise during the day. It never started too early and they were done by 5. Hotel Regina

Book with caution! I reserved an 8 night stay in a junior suite at the Hotel Regina with a very good promotional rate 9 months in advance of my trip to Paris. The hotel did not take a deposit from us but just held the room with a card on file. Unfortunately the card I booked the reservation with was compromised just before our visit to Paris. The credit card numbers had to be changed. Instead of calling or texting, Hotel Regina chose to email us 4 days in advance of our stay to inform us that we needed to update our credit card on file with them. Since we were traveling, I never saw their emails, and Hotel Regina cancelled the room 2 days in advance of our stay without calling or texting. When I finally noticed the email and called reservations at the hotel, they said the best they could do to fix the situation was to book us into a lower quality room for 368 more per night than our original room rate. Ironically, we had the same compromised card on file at The Four Seasons in London and at a hotel in New York City at the beginning of this trip. Neither of those hotels took the aggressive measure of canceling a 9 month reservation and both simply updated the new credit card number when we checked in. I do not understand how Hotel Regina did not text or call us to confirm cancellation and believe they canceled my reservation because the rate was very favorable, and canceling us afforded them the opportunity to reserve the room to someone else at a higher rate. This was a very special anniversary trip for us and Hotel Regina made no effort to address our issue. I should have known by the Google reviews that this place would not live up to expectations. Fortunately, there were plenty of great hotels still available last minute in Paris, and we were able to book another room at a far more reasonable rate than what was proposed by Hotel Regina as their solution. I travel very frequently and have never encountered a situation like this at any hotel in the world. Just bad form and extreme lack of customer care by Hotel Regina. If this is any indication of the level of service we would have received during our stay, Im glad they cancelled my reservation. Wonderful hotel with beautiful and spacious rooms. Lobby is decorated in art nouveau style and its lovely. The service was amazing on all sides and the location directly across from the Louvre can't be beat. Thank you for taking such wonderful care of us and making our Paris trip one to remember This is a decent hotel, but definitely 3 stars. The rooms are average, the service is average and the location is very touristy. They also asked us if we wanted to upgrade when we arrived. They didnt mention it would be for a steep additional fee until I asked. We didnt take the upgrade but it felt like a very unusual thing for a 5 star hotel to do. NOT A 5 star hotels. Our room was stinky and I asked to change our room. The only room available was a more expensive room for an additional 250 per night. We were there for 5 nights. We had two rooms.  The door knob fell off on the door to the bedroom. We asked them to fix it 5 times.  It was still broken when we left. They didnt give us new soap or shampoo daily. We had to ask them. I dont know how they have a 5 star rating if the four seasons is also a 5 star. The hotel is ok but definitely not 5 star service or rooms. The location is great.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hotel London - Paris,"32 Bd des Italiens, 75009 Paris, France",4.0,48.8713793,2.3352648,"This is a very lovely hotel with fabulous staff. Rooms are very clean and tidy and typical French style that is small and quaint.
There's a lift ,it's small but perfectly fine,and air con. I loved the area. As a solo traveller I felt very safe and welcome both in the hotel and outside.  Wonderful. The front desk staff is the best!! The rooms are small but the location is so ideal for a trip in a gorgeous city that it just worked great for us. I would recommend bring a small luggage cause at the entrance there are some stairs that people with big suitcases were struggling more than uslight travelers Service is the reason this hotel is getting 5 stars. The rooms as okay, for the price they are what you pay for. Location is great. Access to anywhere important thanks to various metros close by. But the service made up for everything, the front desk went above and beyond, they helped me check in early after a long flight, was very attentive during my stay and when my flight got cancelled, gave me a cup of coffee on the house and let me stay on the restaurant area until I figured everything out. Thanks! Great location with affordable price! Highly recommend! The welcoming receptionist from Morocco  helped me print my documents and gave me a business card for next reservation. I will definitely come back! It was a lovely hotel to stay in and the staff were wonderful, my only concern was the 20 something steps from the entrance to the lobby, no problems for the young ones but could be a problem for older people or anyone with knee or back problems.  Once in reception there is a small lift to the other floors.  I would recommend this Hotel to others as it was central, close to the Metro and lots of lovely restaurants surrounding it.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Gardette Park Hotel,"1 Rue du Général Blaise, 75011 Paris, France",3.9,48.86098870000001,2.378827100000001,"The hotel has 6 floors and the lift stops at half floors, so there is always a little walking up the curved staircase to do. The hotel faces a small park and there are a couple of quaint eateries in the neighbourhood, which we did not get a chance to try. The staff were friendly upon check in and were kind enough to let us check in, even though we were half an hour earlier than check in time. The hotel came with a kettle and a coffee maker. We stayed in the suite for four and there was just about enough room, though we did not travel with any luggage but had backpacks. Toilet was spacious room temperatures was nice and warm. We did ask for a toothbrush on the first night but they did not have one we managed to get one from the nearby grocery store. The hotel is conveniently located and is in a quiet area. The hotel was value for money and we would stay here again, if we are in the neighbourhood. The hotel is located in a very quiet street while still being very close to the city center. The rooms are clean and well equipped, albeit a little small but what isn't in Paris?. The extra touch comes from the very nice staff that go out of their way to be helpful and forthcoming. The breakfast is also nice, but I would have had the time, I would have gone somewhere in the city. All in all, warmly recommended. Hi,
The room is very basic and quite tight.. very standard European hotel..
Gulia was very accomodating with one of the requests we needed, so I have to give 5 review for the service, but the rooms were average.. so total 3.5 for me. The hotel failed to disclose that the upper floor right above us was under renovation.  All day starting at 8 am they were hammering, sawing etc.7 days a week.  We opened our door once to find it blocked by a ladder and a person actively painting the ceiling in our hallway.  Very frustrating experience and very poor communication.  Rooms overall are very small.  Fine for a one night or weekend but with no coat hangers or closet near the door and very little storage area the room fills up quick.  If you plan on having more than one person for more than a weekend you will want something with a better setup.  If staying anytime in the next several weeksmonths I would be sure to ask about construction and either get a deal or go somewhere else.  They are on the top floor now so assume they have a long way to go since our roomfloor didn't seem to have been updated yet.  Best part of hotel is probably easy access to the 69 bus line which is very convenient for accessing the primary tourist attractions along the Seine. ITS AN EXPENSIVE HOSTEL!!!!We were given room 100 and it was supposed to have a view of the park. However when you open either window you had a view of scaffolding and parked vehicles.
The size of the room was good but the condition was absolutely terrible. The room is located next to the service closet and the kitchen so you are woken up as staff prep for breakfast and guests arrive to dine.
The carpet floor of the room was very uneven as if carpet was placed on top on incomplete flooring and it creaked terribly. The room smelled very old and matched nothing like the photos on the website.  The red tiled bathroom was one open space with one partition wall between the pedestal sink and the shower. The shower had no doors so as you shower water splashed toward the toilet that is right in front of the shower. There were no bath maths for us to use so we used the towels.
Its not a hotel I would recommend to anyone, not for how much it cost during the new year holiday.","Monday: Open 24 hours

"Hôtel de Berri Champs-Élysées, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Paris","18-22 Rue de Berri, 75008 Paris, France",4.3,48.87283720000001,2.305280900000001,"I wanted to take a moment to reflect in peace before fully expressing my experience at the Hotel De Berri. What a magical time! I stayed there with my husband during our getaway to Paris for our wedding anniversary, and I couldn't have imagined a better choice for a Marriott hotel. The cleanliness, the decor, and the architecture inside the building are absolutely stunning. But above all, it's the staff that truly makes the difference. The entire reception team, as well as the concierges, were so kind and welcoming. I especially want to give a special mention to Nathan, who welcomed us and followed up with us throughout our stay. He was incredibly helpful.

We had a problem with the tablet in the room, we couldn't turn down the TV. We reported it to the reception team who responded immediately. When we returned, the problem was solved. I also enjoyed my experience at the bar, although it was a bit underwhelming. Still it was great experiences.

The hotel is located just 0.1 miles from the Champslyses, which made our stay even more enjoyable for strolling around and dining out. The hotel also has a gym in the basement and typically a spa, which unfortunately was under renovation. That said, we don't dwell on the negatives given the unforgettable experience we had.

We will definitely be back for our next stay in the French capital!!! This hotel is very well located next to ChampsElysee, with easy access to metro station. Hotel rooms are spacious and well decorated. I had a wonderful experience staying there for my family vacation.  The staff members went above and beyond to provide excellent service to make our vacation pleasant and special. As titanium member, we received great room upgrade and the breakfast was very nice. Thank Benjamin, Kahima, and more! Absolutely spectacular service from April  one of Concierge  from all of the Concierge staff and the entire staff at the hotel. The sweet upgrade was spectacular, the room perfectly and unruly maintained. We had some issues with luggage that didnt even concern the hotel, but they went above and beyond to assist. As a traveler, and a travel professional? I would 100 recommend them. The location is handy but not much to do onsite. We also had problems pretty much since we arrived  1 on Day 1 the key creation system was not working, so we could not use the elevator or access our room without a staff member accompanying us each time, 2 later that day the television system totally quit working throughout the hotel still down 48 hours later , and 3 there are ongoing problems that further limit our enjoyment. The spa is totally shutdown. The lights in the room are computer controlled and seem to turn on and off at random times, both day and night.  The room smells of sewer drain each time we shower. The shower water also comes out and leaves water on the floor.  No wash cloths in the bathroom . We cant open curtain because people from offices across street stare right into the room. Rooms are very small. There is only one luggage holder rack for one suitcase and we are two  really nowhere to put anything. The staff members are all wonderful and very understanding, but they have a hard job. This is the first Luxury Collection hotel at which we have stayed, but so far the luxury part seems to be completely missing.  The staff and breakfast buffet are outstanding, but we find hotel staff always wonderful at all Marriott hotels we stay at. It is hard to justify and to understand what makes this hotel luxury and the cost it has given all these problems. What a lovely property! The hotel and rooms are beautiful. The service is better! April and the rest of the concierge staff made my stay truly special. I was traveling alone, and they were all very kind and attentive.  They went above and beyond to ensure I had a lovely holiday!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Particular thanks must go to Lilia and the team, who made an extra special effort to mark my wifes birthday. That was really appreciated, and a fantastic indicator of a high quality level of service. Such an hotel experience !
I appreciate the silence in the room , no noise and amazing sleeping time.
The bed is very comfy and the bathroom was giant ! Loved it .

The staff Is amazing and is here for you . They also offer a great selections of wine and the breakfast is amazing .
Also the restaurant and bars next the hotel are perfect !

Great stay Great location and place to stay. The most important the quality of the service a the team. A superb professional team always taking care of the minimal detail and atention  to all the needs of customers. Highly recommended Ive had an amazing experience in this hotel. It is smaller with a more intimate and cozy atmosphere. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, which made a whole difference in our stay, making us fell like home. The location is great, with nice restaurants nearby, easy access to public transportation and a few steps from Champs Elysees. Totally recommend! Great hotel on Champs Eleysee.
Walkable to most locations with metro station near by
The street is lively and lots of restaurants nearby.
Hotel staff is amazing and very friendly. Great service.
Special mention to Colin who went out of her way to welcome us and is one of the best staff i have ever encountered.

Hôtel Dame des Arts,"4 Rue Danton, 75006 Paris, France",4.7,48.85284730000001,2.3422929,"We were lucky enough to stay in the signature terrace room with an Eiffel Tower view and cannot express how amazing this hotel is! The view was spectacular watching the tower sparkle at night was such a highlight!  photos taken on our phones cant capture how close the tower felt, and the view of the other buildings in the area was also lovely.

Every member of the team was so kind and helpful, and were so lovely to see and speak to each day. It felt like they really cared and even little gestures like reminding us to take an umbrella when the weather was poor or remembering my birthday felt special! We were even treated with a personalised welcome card!

The area is also perfect its far enough removed from the hustle and bustle to feel peaceful, but there are plenty of restaurants and stores around. The Metro is also incredibly close and we found it very easy to navigate the city using it, nothing was more than a few stops away!

I have always been someone who thinks that a hotel is just a bed to sleep in at the end of the day but Hotel Dame Des Arts changed this for me our stay at the hotel was so much more than just a bed, and it made our holiday in Paris so much more incredible. I cannot recommend this hotel enough everything about it was perfect! We had a great stay at Htel Dame des Arts.  Its in a great location in the Latin Quarter, you can walk to everything.  The balcony was the highlight, amazing views in all directions, my iPhone camera doesnt do it justice.  The room was small and cozy, great for couples.  The staff was very friendly, Marta was fantastic!  She checked us in and was very welcoming.

Thank you for an amazing stay on our first trip to Paris! Stayed 3 nights at this lovely hotel in Paris. The location is great, plenty of nice restaurants and bars within easy walking distance. Recommend the Rooftop bar with a fabulous view of the city. The staff was very friendly and helped us with our activity bookings and with restaurant recommendations. Although the rooms are quite small, the overall experience of this hotel was great. Will gladly recommend staying here. What an amazing experience!
10 starts in our opinion from check in to check out!
We stayed in a suite with view to the  Eiffel tower which was BRILLIANT!
Services were impeccable at dinner a big shout out to Sarah and Doria! Ladies you were great!!!!!
Food and cocktails was delicious
Hotel is super tidy and clean!
My only tiny not great comment is in regards breakfast variety  not their strong. Other than that, we absolutely loved our stay and it worth every penny. Also literally 2 minutes walking from Notre Dame and around 15 minutes walking to louvre which is fantastic location!
Thank you also to the lovely ladies at reception!
10 out of 10!!!!!! We had a great stay at this hotel last weekend in Paris. Rooms were lovely, if a little small but that's to be expected in a major capital city. Service and staff were great. The roof top bar was tremendous. Incredibly handy central location.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

파리한인민박추천 파리허니하우스,"15 Rue du Faubourg du Temple, 75010 Paris, France",4.4,48.8684439,2.3657206,"If you are worried about security and want to eat Korean breakfast, I definitely recommend this place! The owner is very kind and has previous experience in Korean restaurants, so the food is very delicious! The price is reasonable, so you wont regret it! I stayed from 05.26  05.23.
When I first decided on a place to stay, I didn't think much about it, but in the end, it was a place I was very satisfied with!!
I passed through London before coming to Paris, but the aftereffects of jet lag came later and I wasn't feeling well while I was in Paris. However, the mother in the accommodation provided me with an electric blanket, warm water, and allowed me to rest well, so I was able to recover well. When I arrived, they even cut me some fruit haha.
Advantages
1. Location
This is really the best. The entrance to subway line 9 is right in front, so transportation is convenient, and the Trocadero Square at the Eiffel Tower is on line 9, so I was able to return home safely even after seeing the Eiffel Tower late at night. Also, the Marais district was a 20minute walk away, so it was nice to be able to walk leisurely.

2. Breakfast
Breakfast is served every day at 8am and it is delicious!! What I ate was curry, kimchi stew, boiled pork, seasoned red pepper, grilled ham, fried egg... There's more, but it was delicious anyway!! It's really nice to be able to eat Korean food while traveling. And they always provided fruit for dessert, and the fruit was delicious!!

3. Cleanliness
The sleeping area, bathroom, shower room, and kitchen are all really clean!! My mother is a very clean person, so she cleaned the room every day and cleaned the room while she was out in the afternoon, so I was able to stay very comfortably during my stay!!

4. Electric blanket, hair dryer, and towels provided twice a day, morning and evening
It was very cold when I slept at the beginning of my stay, but they provided an electric blanket so I was able to sleep warmly.

5. Laundry
You can do your own laundry and fold it for 5 euros in the summer and 7 euros in the winter. Is it expensive at first...?? I wanted to do it myself at the youth hostel, but it was nice to be able to do laundry comfortably at a reasonable price!!

disadvantage
1. No eating or drinking in the accommodation and no dinner provided.
As a poor college traveler, it was a bit burdensome to have to buy dinner out every time, but my mother explained that it was better not to eat out in order to keep the accommodation clean, so I understood!!

2. A slightly narrow house...??
It was the offseason, and I was lucky enough to stay alone in a 4person room, so I didn't feel cramped or uncomfortable, but it might feel a bit cramped if the room is full of 4 people during peak season.

In fact, for this price, it is a good accommodation with location, Korean food, and many other things!! I think this would be a good option for those who want to rest well at the accommodation during their trip!!

mother!!
I was able to rest very well during my stay at Paris Honey House!! Thanks to you, I think I will recover well and enjoy the rest of my trip!! Thank you and stay healthy!!! I stayed from August 15th to August 27th.
When I arrived in Paris and found out that the  I had booked in advance was a scam, I was devastated. It was getting dark in an unfamiliar land and I had no idea where to go, so I found it on Google.

The manager came to meet me in front of the metro.
After checking the site, I only paid for 2 nights, but the manager took good care of me like a mother and the location was great, so I stayed for 10 more nights.

Advantages of this house
1. Korean breakfast is very good.
Generous and delicious meals that change daily.

2. Good location!
Very close to the metro
Because it is a place where 5 stations transfer.
Covering all of Paris
Louvre Eiffel Tower Arc de Triomphe Opera Theater
1015 minutes away

3. Clean
The space and bedding were all clean.
The manager is always cleaning and ventilating.

4. Shower room.
Shampoo and conditioner are all provided.

5. Available 24 hours a day.
If you go to Mont chel Michel or northern France
Arrives at 3 am and is available 24 hours a day.
good.

6. The biggest advantage of all  the managers consideration
If I go out without eating breakfast, they at least pack me some fruit.
I heard that I was going to MontCelMichel, but it was cold there and the weather was unpredictable.
We provide blankets and umbrellas so it doesnt matter if you lose them.
I was touched by the request to be careful so as not to catch a cold.
I heard you didnt see the night view of the Eiffel Tower
They say 10 or 11 p.m. is pretty, so they take the subway that night.
Come with us and enjoy the sparkling Eiffel Tower to your hearts content.
He gave it to me to taste it because he said he picked hazelnuts and bought old plums.
Students staying in dormitories are objects and places to sleep.
Even if I make a mess and leave, I feel like a mother.
Please clean it up. They say the kids are so pretty.

Disadvantages of this house
Because it is a commercial street, it is noisy if the window is open.
The building next door, on the first floor of the building opposite, is a restaurant.
The French have a culture of leaving restaurants empty and going outside to eat and drink...
But when I close the window, it's surprisingly quiet.
On the other hand, I'm not scared at all when French people come home late because they drink and chat until past 12 o'clock.

Its nice to have a house in Paris that I really like.
I feel like I have established a base in France

Thank you very much, Chief.
I contacted you when I was at a loss after being scammed.
Rather, it was nice to stay in a nice house.
I hope you prosper I stayed at Honey House for a total of 4 nights from September 15th to 19th! I was really comfortable throughout my stay and the breakfast my aunt made was the best...  I'll leave here what I felt while staying at Honey House!

1 Location
The location really goes without saying... It was so comfortable that it could be said to be the best of any accommodation! There is a subway station a 2minute walk from my house, and there are as many as 5 lines, so I was able to get around comfortably. When I returned home from watching the White Eiffel show at 1 a.m., I was scared because I was alone, but I was relieved because I only had to look ahead and walk for 2 minutes to get home! If you run, it's completely possible for 30 seconds. Actually, thinking about it now, I think it was safe because it was a busy street and there were a lot of people even late at night.

2 Breakfast
They served Korean food for breakfast, and I loved that they made new soups, side dishes, etc. every day! I got boiled pork on the first day, yukgaejang on the second day, and kimchi stew and mushroom pork bulgogi on the fourth day! It was so delicious that I regretted not being able to eat it on the third day because of the tour I signed up for in advance! The food was freshly prepared every morning, so it felt like I was eating homecooked food 

3Cleanliness
Even if I wake up in the morning and go out with my blanket all messed up, it's always neatly folded when I come back in the evening, which makes me feel really good! My aunt kept it clean so I was comfortable throughout my stay haha.

4 Aunt
Aunt, really try to take care of each and every person with all your heart! Those feelings were conveyed to me too  I still vividly remember the image of someone else helping me find something that was lost! And before I left, if I didn't have a transportation ticket, my aunt said she would lend it to me. On the day I went to ride the Bato Monsieur, she was worried when she saw me dressed thinly, so she lent me a scarf so I could ride warmly. There was one day when I overslept and was late for the tour, and my aunt was worried. I was so touched by the way she packed our luggage with us, ran around outside, and caught a taxi with us  My aunt is a very affectionate person  I was so sad when we parted ways that I wanted to spend more time together 

5Other
As you can see from the recent reviews, a lot has changed since the accommodation location was moved, including 24hour free access and 24hour free showering! Of course, you have to use the hair dryer on the lowest level when using it late at night for the sake of others who are already sleeping, but I think this is natural  I also really liked that the shower room and toilet are separated. The shower room has shampoo, conditioner, It was great that body wash was provided so I didnt have to bring it separately! I was grateful that they provided one towel a day and 1.5 or 2 liters of water. Since it is a dormitory, I think you have to deal with the inconveniences that come with having to live with other people, and if you are considerate of each other, you can stay without any particular inconveniences. I think there will be!

Next time I come to Paris again, I will book Honey House without hesitation  I miss your aunt's food so much I will come again next time, so be sure to stay healthy until then Thank you so much!! I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had to extend my stay once more due to the strike. Actually, I was worried and had a lot of concerns due to the mixed reviews, so I wanted to be helpful, so I'm leaving a review! As a result, dont worry and come!! Really I really liked it
My friends who stayed in the same room as me were also worried, but it was so good!! I felt the same way! Korean breakfast every morning... I got boiled pork, kimchi stew, soybean paste stew with Cheongyang peppers, grilled sausages, kimchi pancakes, stirfried kimchi pork, stewed tofu, etc. And I was so impressed that they gave me something different than the same thing, and today they had broiler sauce...   And if you didn't have enough, they gave you plenty of rice and side dishes so you could eat more, and without worrying about what others thought, I and my friends ate more because it was delicious. Kiki If you have basic accommodation etiquette and consideration, I think you will really enjoy it without feeling uncomfortable! During the 4 nights I stayed there, I really enjoyed all my friends and younger siblings who had great manners! I was touched that my aunt really tried to take good care of me! On the last day of my move, I wasn't feeling well, so thank you again for taking such good care of me. Although the prices in Paris are expensive, I was really satisfied and I want to stay there again when I come to Paris. It was close to the subway and in the Marais district, so it was great for shopping and moving around. I will definitely recommend it to my friends if they go to Paris. This is my review of my 4night stay!!!  I want to eat boiled pork It's a night that reminds me of you guys' shells.  I look forward to being able to go again","Monday: Open 24 hours

파리 힐링 민박 (Paris Healing),"14 Bd de Magenta, 75010 Paris, France",4.8,48.8697212,2.3622423,"
I stayed at Healing Minbak for 5 days and 4 nights starting February 3rd! It was my first time traveling to Europe, and before Paris, I stayed at a Korean bed and breakfast in London, so I don't have much experience with Korean bed and breakfasts, but I will try to explain as much as I can to help firsttimers like me make a choice.
First of all, the location of the accommodation is very good. Both North Station and East Station can be reached in about 15 minutes on foot, so it is very convenient for coming from other countries or going out to nearby areas. Also, a large subway station called Relublic is less than 10 minutes away, and if you take Line 8 from here, you can go to most tourist attractions. It's great to be able to! Thanks to this, I never had to worry about transportation when planning my day's travel and was always able to travel smoothly. And since the Marais district is within walking distance 1520 minutes on foot?, it was convenient for shopping and walking around.
Second, the food is delicious. Basically, they provide side dishes such as kimchi and scrambled eggs, as well as different main side dishes for breakfast and dinner every day. Bibimbap, spaghetti, seaweed soup, fried rice, Vienna stirfry, etc. are all very delicious. Since eating out is expensive in Paris, it's really great to be able to eat breakfast and dinner at your accommodation. Moreover, the owners do all the washing up...  And the owners wait for you even if you oversleep in the morning, survey demand for dinner every day, and even if you come in a little later than the designated time, they prepare the same meal for you if you want to eat... It's the best!
Third is security! It was really safe to walk around at night, and the accommodation itself is tripleequipped, and the owners don't leave often and watch over the house, so you don't have to worry! I also brought a bicycle lock because I heard there might be thieves in the accommodation sometimes, but it was of no use.
Lastly, the bosses are very nice. When you travel, many things like this will happen, and whenever that happens, you will stop by and complain to the boss who is taking a break, but he will listen and take good care of you. But don't ever overdo it! These are the people who literally provide an environment for healing. They were so kind that we laughed the entire time we stayed at the accommodation.
In addition, towels are provided every day, hot water works well, and the water pressure is strong... there are many advantages! There were some reviews that were not satisfied with the facilities, but I think this is the best in Paris and among Korean guesthouses. I rested well and enjoyed myself for 5 days. I often go to London, Milan, and Paris, so I often stay at Airbnb or Korean BBs, and this was by far the best place I stayed in Paris!
I tend to read reviews carefully and search blogs and other places to compare trustworthy reviews before making a decision. After the owner of this place changed, the reviews were surprisingly good, so I trusted them and decided to trust them. Thanks to the reviews, I was able to stay in such a great place, so I'd like to ask for my review. I'm leaving a review in case it helps others!

First of all, the most important things I consider when staying at an accommodation are 1. Are the toilets and bathrooms clean, and is it inconvenient to use hot water?
2. Isn't it difficult to communicate with the owner during your stay? Even though I paid my own money to stay there, strangely, there were times when I ended up being criticized if I couldn't meet the owner or staff at a Korean guesthouse with good people.
3. Is the accommodation safe?
I focus on these three things the most, and if you have the same standards as me, I recommend them.
1. Not only the toilet and bathroom, but also the sink and dining table in the room, daily water cups and dishes, water purifier, slipper bed, and towels were always kept clean, so it was very comfortable to use! The accommodation was almost full during my stay, but I had no trouble using the bathroom and toilet at all! The buildings themselves are very old in Paris, so there were some things that bothered me when I stayed at other Korean bed and breakfasts, but this one didn't bother me at all. The bathroom and shower area were always neat and clean, with no scale, mold, or rust! And even if someone washed it right after using it, I didn't have to worry about the hot water and water pressure. It was convenient because there was a hair dryer!
2. The response to KakaoTalk messages was very quick from the time I confirmed my reservation, and even when I had to change my checkin time and when I got off at the North Station late and was a little scared and wanted to ask how to get there because of the strike, they always responded quickly! During my stay, they always communicated with me about how the day was, information about the strike, information about transportation, and restaurants and cafes. I felt unwell due to a cold, so I asked what kind of medicine I could buy, and I was wondering if any of the guests were sick. They said they would prepare Korean cold medicine and provided it to me whenever I needed it. One day, I suddenly came home a little late, so they asked me about dinner and prepared it for me. I told them that I was a sensitive sleeper and had trouble sleeping due to the sound of snoring when the dormitory was full, and they continued that day. They brought us a plug and prepared it for us they gave us a good one so we had a good night's sleep that day haha, and we were happy to check out and store our luggage...! I was always able to stay at ease thanks to the attentive consideration of really warm people.
3. The entrance to the building had double security, there was a supermarket downstairs, and there was a major road and station nearby, so the way home wasn't scary at all. It was very convenient because it was so close to the Marais district, and the station was right in front, so it was also very convenient! I arrived in Paris late at night during the strike and had to walk, but I was able to walk without any difficulty at all! Of course, now that the strike is over, I think I can take the subway and come directly to the front more conveniently.
I really recommend it! They always prepare a warm meal early in the morning, they always prepare a different menu for dinner, and the two of you take great care in meal preparation, so we always eat with satisfaction and rest comfortably! I think I'll be coming to Paris again soon, and I don't think I'll stay here without hesitation even then! I will come again. Thank you, boss! The reason why my first solo trip was successful was because I was able to rest comfortably and eat delicious food at the accommodation! I was able to eat delicious food for breakfast and dinner and walk around comfortably. I was happy while staying here and I was really grateful to the owner and his wife!!! I was worried because I was alone, but the owners made my stay so comfortable that I met some nice people and was grateful. I will stay here again next time I go to Paris! Thank you so much! Seeing is better than hearing, so I think it's better to go and see for yourself rather than judging by reading hundreds of reviews! The cost of eating out in Paris was very expensive. Healing BB provided breakfast and dinner twice, but you didn't have to pay extra, and the quality of the food wasn't poor. It was nice to be able to save money on food and do other things I wanted with that money.

The first atmosphere of the accommodation was quiet, so I thought I wouldn't be able to talk to the people I was staying with, but it started a conversation, and we had a lot of fun talking about each other's stories, travel stories, etc. every day!

The location of the accommodation was very close to the subway station, so I didn't feel there was a problem with security.

Conclusion Good value and good taste Facilities, service, location, and meals were all good.

1. Facilities
I stayed in an 8person dorm for 2 nights and a single room for 2 nights, and both rooms were okay. It was nice that there was a sink in the dormitory so I could easily wash my hands or brush my teeth. The single room was nice because the bed was very big and soft.

2. Service
The owner and his wife were both really friendly! He recommended good restaurants, helped me carry my luggage, talked with me while I ate, and gave me various travel tips.

3. Location
All famous stores such as ofr, merci, and vintage shops were all within walking distance, and it was nice that there were many art museums nearby, including the Pompidou. There were two subway stations nearby, but because of the strike, I couldn't use them as much as I thought, which was disappointing. It has been operating normally since the day before I checked out, so... If you go when there is no strike, you will be able to use the subway station really comfortably.

4. Meal
Breakfast was served at 8 o'clock and dinner was served at 7 o'clock, and everything was delicious! The kimchi that I made myself was really delicious, and all the menu items, including spaghetti, steak, stirfried pork, and bibimbap, were all delicious It was nice to have purified water.

If I had to pick one thing that was disappointing, it would be that the soundproofing wasn't very good... This is a problem that applies to all European apartments, so I thought that would be the case.

It was nice to be able to stay comfortably for 5 days. Recommended!!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The rice comes out really well too! They give you 2 meals a day, but they always include a side dish with meat... so the guests are more worried about whether you have any margin left... haha I stayed in the 8person female room, and I made a lot of good friends, but it's a group room and there's only one bathroom, so it's inconvenient in that respect. It may have its flaws, but considering this price, I'm just thankful.
The location is convenient, so you can walk to everything, and Paris Gare du Nord is only 10 minutes away!! The boss's response is quick and great!! Two people stayed for 5 nights and 6 days, and although it may be inconvenient because there is no elevator and only one bathroom shower room, we did not experience any difficulties while using it. Korean food for breakfast and dinner and a menu that changes daily make me look forward to it rather than buying it. Tips for shopping with your spare money in Paris, where dining out is expensive! It was a 6 a.m. train, so I had to leave at 5 a.m., but the owner came out ahead of time and was waiting to drop off my luggage. Really great attention to detail. Thanks to you, I'm doing well while I'm here. On Wednesdays and Saturdays, they grill pork belly for dinner, and the pickled green onions are so delicious. It can also be an enjoyable meal if guests are smart enough to prepare something for several people, such as garlic or cola, in advance. They prepared lettuce in advance so we bought it too, but I don't think we need to duplicate it.
Boss, I rested well, ate well, and had a good time! Thank you. I wish you happiness. I visited in 2018 and it was a bit narrow and the shared bathroom was uncomfortable.
The owner is very generous as they provide 2 servings of Korean food and also pork belly.
There were no bad bugs and it is a great place to stay cheaply without being greedy.
Towels are provided and the location is in the Marais district. Is the Korean food served here Korean? Is it Mongri? Joe, it was great to be able to eat delicious Korean food for dinner. The location of the accommodation was also close to major tourist attractions, making it perfect for walking around and enjoying Paris.
The owner is also friendly, and its great value for money!!! It was the best.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

To write an honest review, the rice is really delicious! They prepared breakfast and dinner with so much care that I ate it more deliciously than in Korea. I think the location is good as it is near the Pompudou Center.

I don't think there are any downsides, but the space when eating is a bit narrow?! Everything was so good that I think I had a good stay
I stayed comfortably as if it was my own home I stayed for 6 nights and had a great stay. It's my first time staying at a Korean bed and breakfast, but when I use a hostel or Airbnb, I end up spending more on food than I thought because I buy every meal, and I don't really feel like I ate because the food wasn't right. , I came here and had a large breakfast and dinner, and it was so hearty and good. I went to buy beer with the friends I met at the accommodation, but I never bought lunch... haha I ate better than at home, so I came to Korea after Paris. , I couldn't think of any food I wanted to eat in Korea. Bossam, pork belly, ribs, they always had meat side dishes.. hahaha I really enjoyed eating them!! Since I haven't stayed at other guesthouses, I didn't think the accommodations were too small! If you try it, you won't find any inconveniences due to the narrow space. The only downside is that there is only one bathroom..? However, when I lay down in the room and waited, my aunt told me that anyone could come, so there was no major inconvenience.
Oh, and the location is really good. It's 2 minutes away from the subway station, so you don't have to be afraid to come in after sunset and see the night view of the Eiffel Tower, and it's close enough to tourist attractions that you can walk to most places!! Considering that this price actually includes breakfast and dinner, I think the accommodation is almost free. Haha. Be sure to go and try the delicious food. I'm impressed. My aunt, I had a really good stay for 6 nights. Thank you!!! The location of the accommodation is great!!
The rice is so delicious, not only for breakfast but also for dinner haha.
And for the pork belly party and boiled pork party, I brought beer and wine.
I think I had a good time talking with the people at the accommodation.
The washing area is a bit narrow, but you can wash well enough.
It was really comfortable during my 6 nights and 7 days stay.
Next time I come to Paris, I will have to come here!!
And it was great to meet so many good people. I stayed here for 5 days and 4 nights from August 22nd to 26th. Your aunt is really kind. When I entered, they cleaned all the wheels of my suitcase, and when I couldn't eat, they prepared me with a separate side dish, so I was really grateful Thanks to my aunt's consideration, I had a good stay in a nice room!
1. The location is great. It's really a 30second walk from the station.
2. There are many cafes and restaurants nearby, so it is not dangerous.
3. Breakfast and dinner are provided, and they are very delicious.
4. Please change towels every day.
5. Please clean the room every day.
6. Luggage storage is also available.
7. Paris itself is hot and it is difficult to install air conditioning, so it is not hot when I sleep because there is a fan.
8. Please give me water as well. I stayed in a dormitory for over a week. My aunt took good care of me from the first day to the last, and the food was really delicious! I ate breakfast every time and looked forward to dinner, so I came in on time and ate. The location of the accommodation was perfect as it was in the center of Paris, and the Pompidou Center and a shopping mall nearby were within 10 minutes' walking distance, so I was able to walk around easily even late at night. It was right next to the subway station, so it was a good location to see the night view of the Eiffel Tower and to go sightseeing. The bed was always clean, the room was well organized, and the bathroom was also clean! Next time I come to Paris, I plan to use Notre Dame BB again",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

I stayed 4 days with my friend and time flies!
For sure I will visit here again.

I also read so many good reviews for the owner, at that moment they visited Korea so I couldnt meet them but their daughter Hana Kang supported us from the bottom of her heart.

She is very talented in various fields and wellknown in the France culture and language so she gave us a lot of useful information and it helped us to enjoy our short trip.

You buy the ferry ticketBateaux Mouches at a discounted priceEUR 10, originally EUR 15 so we enjoyed Paris onboard twice, and took so many nice pictures!

She provided us with a wonderful Korean breakfastbuffet every day.
You can enjoy the tasty Rice and Korean soup with various Korean Banchans, we didnt even visit Korean restaurants at all.

The ingredient was fresh and some unique Banchan is made from real Korean organic ingredient.
It reminded me of when I was staying in Korea with my family.

You can also enjoy Korean cup ramen with tasty rice and wellfermented Korean Kimchi for only EUR 3, at any time!

If I stayed in a hotel as usual, I couldnt experience those kinds of things, so if you are interested in Korean culture, I highly recommend staying here to enjoy Paris and Korea together! I stayed there with my Korean friend. And there are really authentic Korean atmosphere. The host is very friendly, house is simple and cozy.
Maybe, if I stay longer, I wouldn't eat Korean breakfast every day because it's not my culture, but food was really tasty. I enjoyed to stay there, I felt like at home.
I'd like to go back  Very friendly host. Amazing Korean style breakfast and dinner. It's not a 5 star hotel but great value for the money.

퐁피두 민박,"95 Rue Beaubourg, 75003 Paris, France",3.3,48.86454060000001,2.3550224,"I dont think it will be easy to find this level of accessibility and convenience at this price. In my opinion, I thought the sanitary conditions and management were excellent for the price, the room was comfortable, and the hot water was great! Above all, the owner was so warm and kind that I felt comfortable and happy during my stay. When I come to Paris again, I want to visit again. Bring your toiletries! The price is cheap but the location is great. The owner was also kind and nice. The bathroom is a bit disappointing, but overall I'm satisfied considering the price. If I go to Paris again, I want to visit again. I had a great stay! I don't think I'll ever go back.. The bedding looks bad and the mirror in the room is broken... haha. Maybe it's because I went before the trash from the people who stayed the night before was taken out, but it felt very dirty. It's a bed and breakfast where men and women live together, but the shower room is made of opaque glass, and there are places where sheets are not attached. There are shampoos and body washes lying around on the floor, and even the shower room door doesn't seem to close properly. They don't even provide meals. It's okay The bathroom shower booth was so cramped that even one person could fit in it. When I tried to wash it, it bumped into me. Plus, it smelled a bit too much. A foreigner on the same floor was racist and tried to open our room and come in. The second floor was very difficult to climb. Aside from the location factor, I was so skeptical that I thought I would have to pay for all of this. There was a Chinese restaurant below, so it was inconvenient to have a strong smell coming out when you open the door. As you can see, the location is 5 points. There is a supermarket 20 seconds away and a subway station 1 minute away. Nearby museums are also within walking distance. While walking, you can visit the charming alleyways of the Manet district and famous vintage shops. 10 out of 5 for the meal  The taste of your aunt's cooking is excellent  And a quick meal for dinner? The beer and wine they provide are excellent  I will give 4 points for the facilities. It is a total of 5 floors. I only brought one bag and didn't feel any inconvenience, but it may be a little inconvenient for people bringing suitcases. But it's the same wherever you go Even if you check in and check out twice, it's 5 minutes The bed mattress was great! The shower and toilet facilities are also satisfactory. Lastly, aunt! I give it 100 points  He was so kind and cool, cleaned up the place cleanly, told me to eat even if it was late, and even complimented me and said nice things. It was the best.  It was a place I wanted to go to again! Thank you aunt!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

It felt like home cooking. It was Chuseok, so they made rice cake soup and made and baked dumplings themselves. I was really impressed with the taste.. 
It was so delicious that I came back to the hotel every day for dinner during my trip. I highly recommend it. I stayed for almost two weeks, and my aunt took care of everything and helped me. And dinner is really delicious. I came halfway, had dinner, and then went back out. And although it's above Paris, Line 7 is really just a 3minute walk away, so it's very easy to access central Paris attractions and attractions such as the Louvre Museum and Opera Garnier. Paris itself is not big, so it goes by really quickly. Personally, I want to go back to Paris. The owner took great care of me from the time I walked in until the time I left! The inside of the accommodation was always clean. It is also a neighborhood with good security, and there are always security guards stationed in front of the apartments. Above all, the rice was so warm and delicious. If you crave Korean food, be sure to eat it at your accommodation for dinner! I'll definitely see you with others next time! I think the advantage of the apartment being that it is close to the subway station and that the apartment is located is very safe.
I am also satisfied with the cleanliness of the accommodation as it is maintained by my aunt on a regular basis.

However, it was a bit uncomfortable because I couldn't control my actions, such as taking a shower in the early hours of the morning or drinking and talking loudly in the living room. When I went, there were only two people from the other team, but they gave me a separate room and it was nice to have a private room! Although there was only one bathroom, it was very cozy and there was no inconvenience in using it. It was nice to have two meat side dishes in the morning, and when I asked my aunt how to get to the airport, she kindly showed me a more convenient way and helped me carry my luggage to the bus stop.

코코파리,"18 Rue du Caire, 75002 Paris, France",3.2,48.867563,2.3511285,"Advantages First of all, the advantage of staying at a Korean bed and breakfast is that you can get breakfast and dinner, which saves money. We stayed at the 2nd location and the location was really good. Its nice to be able to walk to Notre Dame and the Louvre! I like it because its close to the subway station
Disadvantage I was very concerned about the noise of the employees fighting at night, whether it was the boss or the aunt.. You can hear the fighting very easily, so don't go if you don't like children. The child moves around well. I liked it because it was cute, but I really don't recommend it if you don't like children. The door to the room we stayed in was broken and kept opening, so we had to block it with a suitcase while we slept. And the smell of cigarettes comes from next door. And since we had to enter through the intercom, we couldn't press the keypad, but the owner didn't answer, so we had to wait. This accommodation is only recommended for those who want to see the location. I used the first branch and it was great.
First of all, they serve breakfast and dinner, and side dishes are provided.
There are 34, and the menu changes every time. Also two days a week
For dinner, they grilled pork belly, and it was delicious as they prepared everything including green onion salad, cucumber slices, lettuce, ssamjang, garlic, and pepper. And my aunt took great care of every detail,
He also recommends travel destinations, and when asked, he goes to Paris.
You know everything about it
The location is close to lines 3 and 4. Lines 8 and 9 are also a short walk away. Also, there are many inexpensive supermarkets, delicious bakeries, and cafes near the accommodation. I used the supermarket often!!
If you ask my aunt, she will tell me
The facility was a double room, so I shared it with a friend and it was more spacious than I expected.
It wasn't narrow. There were two shower rooms and two toilets, so I didn't feel like there was anything lacking. There wasn't much overlap.
My aunt cleans the bathroom, shower room, and room every day and brings me new towels.
The accommodation is costeffective! I think I will come again next time I come to Paris.
I guess it's a place where we all live together.
It is difficult to wash too late in the day. I recommend this place if you like the military. It's a place I can't help but criticize. Yes! Why? Yes?  First of all, I definitely wake up at 8 o'clock. Yes! Bobmeogeoknockknock, bapmeogeo, he continued to say in a very loud voice. And
They have their own timetables and rules so I have to be careful even though I am paying for the room. I really wanted to die  But! The reason it has one star is because its free.
The only thing that matters is that the rice is Korean food. The scariest time is when I take a late shower and open the door, and the aunt is looking at me with the curtains open. Or when I go out for a short time late at night, the look in her eyes that keeps looking at me at the slightest sound is so scary. She likes thrills. I recommend it to anyone. I won't go there. Yes! The reason I say yes is because this aunt always adds yes! to the end. Then, good work. The meal is delicious. I have an aunt who is kind and always tries to do something for me. Thank you very much. Basically, it's clean and tidy, it's comfortable, and breakfast and dinner are delicious. They keep giving me more rice and side dishes. However, please note that it is on the 2nd floor and there is no elevator. In Europe, the ground floor starts from floor 0 Please note!! Visit our first store! The location is great! It's easy to go anywhere! My aunt prepares 34 Korean dishes for breakfast in the morning, and it's so delicious! However, the water pressure in the shower room is very poor, and every time I shower, I turn on the water from the sink outside, but it seems like I am taking a shower using that water... The shower room can be used until 12 midnight. It will be okay considering this shower facility. Oh, by the way, there are a lot of stairs, so it will be difficult if your suitcase is heavy...",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The roommates are generally quiet and friendly, the toilet door is not very soundproof, and if someone goes to the toilet at night, even if he is very careful, it will make a loud sound of water, you'll definitely need earplugs.
This is a large hotel with many guests, you may need to queue for breakfast.
It is located next to the train station and subway station, which is very convenient. This place is more than fine.  It does what it says on the tin and, for the price you pay, it's a great place to stay.  Dormitory living comes with all the smells and sounds you would expect.  It's not quite as snazzy as the pics would suggest, but it's still a cool place.

I found the staff absolutely lovely and perfectly pleasant.  Great breakfast which is well worth the money.

My only gripe is that the roof terrace is seasonal, and it was closed at the time of my stay in October.  No mention of this in the description of the place.  Big shame because the 9th floor terrace has great views across to Montmartre.  I can understand that they don't open the bar in the off season, but they actually lock the door, making it inaccessible for residents.  Would've been a lovely place to chill out.  And it would be much fairer to prospective guests if this was made clear.

However, a very nice atmosphere with hard working staff, and a good location for your Paris tourism. Noisette Was super friendly to us when we met going up the elevator to the roof top. She did a great job with our drinks. She was very busy hard working and helpful. Made us some great cocktails as we enjoyed the view. Thanks for a wonderful experience!

Greg and Julia On my first day in Paris, I went to a hotel rooftop to enjoy some wine. The view was quite lovely. There was a pleasant atmosphere with club music playing. The staff was very welcoming. Brahim kept checking in to make sure everything was fine, very attentive.

I highly recommend this place for romantic sunset dates, solo visits, or group gatherings. My stay at the Generator has been incredible. The staff have made me feel so welcome. Sophie helped me with everything I needed. She was more than welcoming and answered all the questions I could have. She even provided me with a list of places to visit in Paris. Her kindness will not be forgotten. Because of her and another staff member Ill be recommending this place to everyone who stays in Paris. Seriously this staff will go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. They are so caring.","Monday: Open 24 hours

JO&JOE Paris - Nation,"61 Rue de Buzenval, 75020 Paris, France",4.5,48.8524511,2.4009537,"JoeJoe Paris  Nation is a refreshing departure from the usual accommodation choices in Paris. Over the past few years, there has been a surge of alternative lodging options, and JoeJoe stands out for its unique blend of a hostel vibe with a concertlike atmosphere. If youre looking for luxury, this might not be the place for you, but if youre seeking an adventurous, creative, and downtoearth experience, JoeJoe delivers exactly that.

The rooms are minimalist, almost evoking the feel of being backstage at a music venue. While the dcor is pared down to the essentials, everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided. The beds, though covered in a fake leather or plastic material that can get humid at times, are surprisingly soft and comfortable. I slept soundly for three nights. The one downside might be that the rooms are a bit dark, but that seems to match the aesthetic of the place.

Where JoeJoe truly shines is in its service and atmosphere. The staff is exceptionally friendly and welcoming, going out of their way to ensure guests feel at home. Upon departure, we even received hugs, which speaks volumes about the personal touch they provide. Though we didnt have breakfast there, the coffee was excellent, and we opted to explore the citys brunch scene instead.

The bathroom and shower facilities are modern and spotless, adding a touch of luxury to an otherwise strippedback room setup. Despite the simplistic accommodations, the lively and warm environment, combined with the excellent service, made our stay memorable. We will definitely recommend JoeJoe to others and will likely return ourselves. pros
 the service was fantastic
 lovely location
 great bathrooms
 fantastic rooftop patio.

cons
 everyone was french. its a hostel, it should be diverse and not full of french people. we were one of, if not the only nonfrench people there. I dont understand why French people are staying in hostels in their own country.
 the shower did leak and got some of my clothes wet, but it was not the end of the world.
 one of the people that shared a room with us got my girlfriend and i sick. not only did he get us sick, but he kept the whole room up every night. he ruined the rest of our europe trip. its extremely selfish of him to put others in harm. if you are sick, do not stay in a mixed dorm you moron.
 It was warm but that was out of the hostels control.
 it wouldve been nice to know about events or pub crawls in the city. Immaculate hostel. Staff are so friendly. Check in process was quick and efficient. I love the LED lights around the hallways and the bathrooms are gorgeous and very clean. Would definitely go again. 5 stars!  I loved my stay there. Super close to the metro and well connected to the main attractions. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again. I loved the location, which was close to a metro station, a grocery store, a bakery, a library, and several restaurants. 4 euro for a towel is not bad in my opinion, especially if you don't have much room in your suitcase  Bathroom was pretty clean throughout the day. I hated that the AC in the room didnt work well. The room was warm. I woke up sweating several times. I might have enjoyed it if it had been winter.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
山杉青旅Hostel Sasa,"262007, Taiwan, Yilan County, Jiaoxi Township, 十六結路103之37號",4.9,24.8079276,121.7649372,"Probably the best one hostel in Yilan! Great hospitality, impressive design, giant bed space, and easy transportation. Highly recommend for all travelers if you wanna enjoy the true beauty of Yilan The building is very new. All of the furniture and amenities are very modern and new. The staff is very polite and helpful. I was here with my 5 friends and we all had a great time. Very nice Let me start with the conclusion. If you are on vacation and can tolerate children running around and talking loudly in the room, then consider staying at this hostel.

Lets talk about the advantages first
1. In terms of beds, I booked a double capsule room this time. The beds are large and the height of the upper bed is higher than that of ordinary youth hostels. You can almost stand on it.
2. Regarding the bathroom and toilet, if you stay in room 203, the bathroom space is super large and spacious, and the hair dryer is very powerful.
3. In terms of parking, there is a quite large place to park, and there are also 2 lady bicycles that can be rented for free.

Disadvantages
1. The stairs are difficult to climb and are not nonslip and have a large gap. It is easy to slip when climbing with socks on. There is only a handrail on the right side of the upper bunk. You must be very careful when going down the stairs.
2. The curtains on the bed block the airconditioning, so you need to open them a little to make the bed less hot. Although the beds are equipped with electric fans, you will still wake up from the heat in the morning.
3. The public space on the second floor is stuffy and smelly.
4. The door was posted asking not to lock it and no door key was provided. This is related to the conclusion I mentioned above.

Finally, lets talk about the biggest shortcoming of this time

I believe that everyone who chooses to stay in a youth hostel will have a common consensus that there should be no loud talking, noisy food, or eating in the room, so at least the people staying in the hotel will be people with the ability to control their behavior. If you are a family with children, you should not stay in a youth hostel. Or you should choose cladding or cladding.
After breakfast this morning, I went back to bed to catch up on my sleep until checkout. It turned out that two children, probably elementary school or below, opened the door of the room and the door of the next door room maybe they live next door, not sure, and there were two children in the two rooms. He was running back and forth in the room, and was talking loudly and making noise in our room my mother seemed to live in the bed here, so the children came to find her. I stopped her directly, but she continued the above behavior after not being quiet for a long time. My mother didn't care, and the door was closed and opened again. Many times, I didnt stop loudly because I felt someone else was sleeping in the room. I was tired of going up and down the stairs to close the door and tell the children not to make noise, so I went down to the first floor and tried to find the front desk staff for help, but I couldnt find them twice. People had no choice but to give up and leave without catching up on sleep.
I'm not sure if the room next door is also a youth hostel room or a quadruple room, but I won't come back if I can't have a good rest in the sleeping space. Family visitors can be received but I hope not to disturb other guests or the hostel. Restrict incapacitated children from staying in the hotel, or at least provide room keys so that guests can lock the door to avoid being disturbed by nonresidents. A very nice youth hostel to stay in  the courtyard can park cars and motorcycles. Surrounded by fish ponds or paddy fields?, walking nearby and watching birds and dragonflies playing in the water, listening to the sound of running water and the chirping of insects is super healing. If the weather is clear, you can see the stars. The architectural style is simple, the space arrangement is comfortable and clean. The backpacker room has large beds and lockers, and there is also a spacious balcony to dry clothes. The male staff member who wears glasses and has long eyelashes looks slightly paralyzed  But he is actually very kind and a good person! !

Fun Inn Taipei,"100, Taiwan, Taipei City, Zhongzheng District, Yanping S Rd, 21號2樓",4.0,25.04572499999999,121.510765,"By far the best hostel I've stayed at in Taipei and I've experienced four others. It's exceptionally clean, wellorganized, and almost fully automated. The doubledecker beds with stairs are a nice touch. The staff, especially the lady at the front desk, was incredibly kind and enthusiastic, offering great recommendations for local delicacies. A fantastic stay overall! I had a very nice stay in Fun Inn Taipei last May 2024. I arrived around 10pm and the people at the front desk were really accommodating. They waited for me informed before of my flight details. Super convenient, very near Ximendeng. A few minutes walk to Exit 6 of Ximen Station and Taipei Main Station.

There is a line of restaurants, one is halal, downstairs, a 711 nearby, and a family mart.

I stayed at the female dorm type and we have our own comfort room and shower room. They have a locker for your things but is a bit small so I put my medium size baggage near my bed. They have water dispenser if you need water. They are open from 10am until 10pm. So close to a night market, buses, trains, stores, and walkable to sightseeing sites. Easy to get to from airport. Rent towels. Showers smell a little. Good lockers. Small place, but theres a hangout spot downstairs. Have a computer and second hand section. Not too social, but good to crash. Bunk beds, 4 per room, bathroom around the corner. Anyway, it is a great value compared to way too expensive Green World Hotel SongShan where I was prior to the Fun Inn Taipei. Great location for nightlife!  I stayed in a dorm room for one night. It was clean and perfectly adequate for a short stay. The friendly staff even let me store my luggage before checkin and after checkout, which was a huge help. Just be aware that the dorm rooms are small and narrow.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Mini Voyage Hostel,"No. 103號, Guolian 1st Rd, Hualien City, Hualien County, Taiwan 970",4.8,23.9910256,121.602621,"Book this hotel last minute booked at 8.30 PM, checked in at 10.15 PM. The receptionist isn't there because they only available from 8.00 AM to 10.00 PM. So I inform the hotel using line account. They give me the perfect instructions to get in to the hotel and my room. They also lock the door after 9.30 PM. I just left by luggage which weighs around 15 kg in the lobby because my room is on the 3rd floor and its safe there.

I'm staying on the 6 person dormitory room. The room smells nice and it is REALLY CLEAN. There are 1 bathroom to use inside the room which will be used by the 6 person inside the room. Although we share the room, it feels really secure and really private because they have a curtain to segregate your area. Both Chin and Eli were amazing! They helped me get settled in and gave me great advice on how to spend my time in hualien. I'll definitely be coming back in the future! I can't recommend Mini Voyage Hostel enough. The location is ideal, being near directly across from the train station. The receptionists are friendly, proactive, and communicative. Our room was very spacious and the beds were comfortable. If you're a bit sensitive to sound, you might want to pack some earplugs, but I found that noise and traffic from outside was not too bad after the later hours, and I slept very well the nights I was here.

Common areas are kept clean and are comfortable and stylish. There is water available, as well as tea and coffee. The vibe overall is quite warm, down to earth, and friendly.

I would like to also express my gratitude to Frank, who gave us some great local food recommendations, and was very friendly and helpful with check in. Amazing service and the staff are friendly. Eli and Chin were lovely and so helpful. Rooms are clean. Will definitely come back. I stayed one night in the twin room and it was comfortable for my needs  comfortable bed, clean bathroom, working AC, desk, and hangers. Good location steps away from Hualien train station.

They organise some tours or workshops everyday too  for free  super nice if you want to meet people. Great location, extremely clean hostel, clean bathrooms and spacious showers. Would be great if the lighting near the sinks were brighter to facilitate teeth brushing. The common area is really relaxing and set out well. Many guests will avoid sitting near you, so not the most social hostel. Cooked breakfast, taste is ok but great value considering. I stayed for 2 nights. The hostel is very cozy like home, they also provide indoor slipper. The lounge is open for everyone, can chill there. Everyday breakfast is different, there also have water dispenser. They also plan some small activity like nitendo night, small tour around the hostel, they will intro the foods and attraction surroundings. At dorm, everyone have the personal locker to keep things, bathroom also have hair dryer,shampoo as well. For me is a good experience, look forward to come back. This hostel is in the perfect location in Taipei, close to many great neighbourhoods, night markets, and transit options.

The common areas are clean and great for relaxing.  They also serve freshly cooked breakfast for free, and even had a vegan diet card available to give to the chefs.

The mixed dorm room was just ok.  It desperately needed to be aired out, as there was a bad smell from all the people coming and going. Beds were comfortable though.

If you're looking for a social hostel though, this isn't it.  Everyone keeps to themselves.

Also worth noting that it seems to be normal across Taiwan to not be flexible with checkin times, even if they have a bed free.  So don't expect to show up anywhere early and get access to your bed!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Cons
1. Poorly maintained.
2. Cleaness, 610.
3. Friendliness, 310.
4. Sleep quality, 210.
5. Most front desk employees are kind and professional, but there's one male employee who's quite passive aggressive, unprofessional, and rude. Their employees' monthly salary is between 30K to 31K NTD w a 3mo probation period.
6. The bed next to the window has poor sound isolation, poor heat insulation.
The dryers are out of order, but in reality the owner just wants to save cost. They turned off the lobby's AC at night, the carpet stinks, I never saw them cleaning the carpet.
7. I forgot my room card once, I asked a male employee to help me to open the door, he was extremely impatient, and that was a terrifying experience.
8. There's a permanent resident in this hostel, but he thinks he is the management and he isn't shy to discipline you two three times if you misplaced things in the fridge by accident.
9. They passover as much costs onto the clients as possible, they will charge you for a slightly damaged room card when it's part of business operational expenses.
10. We decided to stay in Taipei for an extra two days, I forgot to extend the room the evening before. Upon my return, I still had my bags in there and my things in the room. The aggro employee told me because they didn't know where we went as tourists, they almost wanted to call the police for failing to extend the room for two extra nights.
11. The aggro employee initially asked my friend to switch rooms every night to save cleaning costs, then the other male employee subsequently decided that the room switching wasn't necessary.

I cannot recommend this place, it is not a tourist friendly hostel. Decent location. Right next to a 247 supermarket and decent pricing for being in Taipei. The lobby was nice too. The only bad thing is...I couldn't say goodbye on my last day to ""Yu Huan""?, the lovely girl at the front desk! Guess she had the day off. Anyways...I would recommend backpackers hostel!

Ps I left a ""Ghana 85 dark chocolate bar"" in the fridge...whoever reads this can go ahead and take it. I checked in on July 1112 2024.
I found out that I got insect bite after I got home.
It looked like the bed has fleas for some reasons.
I wont go there again. I called this place and they denied it. There are carpet in the hallway. The light in the hallway is very dark. Stayed here for 3 nights. The location was good, it was close to bus stops and the metro which was convenient. Lots of restaurants and convenience stores around, as well. The staff were helpful and polite.

I didnt think the rooms were very clean my bed sheets had some stains, the walls of my bunk had dried snot some with blood, seen in photos, and the walls are peeling and damaged. I cleaned off the snot because it was so gross to look at. Stayed a lot of hostels and decided that I would just bear with it, since sometimes a replacement bed can be worse. Owerall, the hostel is cool decorated renovated . The rooms are clean . Staff is friendly and helpful.
The wifi service is really bad.  1
The location is ok central. 
The kitchen and free waschingmashine is a nice treat. 
Hope you improve the wifi connection.

Great value for double bed in shared dorm. The facilities are very modern and clean.

Unfortunately the second time we came the front desk staff were rude. The bathroom attached to the dorm room echoes loudly. Many guests use the hairdryer past 11pm and early morning. In addition to the noise, the light in the dorm stays on and is quite bright. The fixtures are very modern but the ladder creaks when someone is coming down and the curtin squeaks when you open it. It was very difficult to get a good night sleep.

The hostel has free ear plugs which helped. If you are a deep sleeper or happy to use earplugs and eye mask I would recommend this hostel as its great value for money, modern and clean facilities, good location. The location is great and the room size was okay. There is some common area but not a lot so its usually occupied. The worst part about this place is that they only have one toilet on each floor, so for roughly 20 people. Because of this you constantly have to wait in line to use it. Besides that, there was no hot water and they charged extra for towels. Giving 2 stars because it's a 2 stars hostel. Was charged 5000 NTD for a 4bed room on new year eve. Toilets, showers and sinks are good. But no urinoir? Also, the charger plug didn't function and the shoe cabinet was a mess. Stayed for 89 hours in double bed in dorm with a friend.

Check in process was fine, receptionist wouldnt win any awards in hospitality  but he gave all that we needed.

Dorm was okay, upper bunk was hard to climb up to though. Restrooms for dorms are mixed. Saw a girl and guy kissing in the bathroom hallway.

Also scary experience when I was awakened at night by a traveling couple shouting at each other at 330 AM at lobby. My bed was nearest to door so could hear the muffled argument.

Check out was quick  just left the key in the receptionist. Locations the only good thing for me. The location was really great. Only a few minutes from Taipei 101 and there's a bus stop right in front. My room is very comfortable. Service was superb. If I were to go back to Taipei, I'd definitely stay here again. The bathrooms and toilets were very clean. There's also washer and dryer available for doing laundry. There's shampoo and body wash available when you shower.

My flight to Taiwan arrived very late, but they gave me instructions for self check in. My flight back home also left late in the evening. They were okay with me leaving my luggage behind so I can enjoy my last few hours in Taipei without getting weighed back by my heavy things.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

I had a really nice time here away from the crowds and noise of Taipei. Spent a wonderful 2 nights there! The rooms were clean and spacious, there is also a nice social area with boardgames and tv. It's located by a quiet river, which I thoroughly enjoyed my early morning walks. However, is little far from the train station and the city centre, especially if you don't have your own mode of transportation. They do offer bicycles for their guest to use, which is a nice way to stroll through the back streets of Luodong. The owner and staff were all friendly and welcoming. One of the best hostel in Taiwan!!!
The tentthemed room is super cute and comfy
The only thing that makes me a little unsatisfied would be theres only a few bathrooms in the whole place. This place is marvelous. It's not only clean and comfortable but it has a super cool look to it. The owner's are a delight and make you feel at home straight away. It's a fuss free home away from home.

My wife and I have been travelling for about 2 years and this is by far the coolest hostel we've stayed in. Being greeted with a cup of coffee on arrival, super fast wifi, tonnes of bean bags and so much space was really charming.

There is free bike hire and this made exploring the surrounding areas super easy.

The beds in the mixed dorm we're spacious, clean and comfortable and had little extras like curtains, lights, usd and plug sockets.

There's lots to see and do in the hostel it's self, things to buy, a cute kitchen, games, movies being shown on the projector, music playing. Just the coolest vibe.

Would we stay here again? 100 Great place to stay! The staff are very friendly and speak good English too. The place is clean, nicely decorates and perfect for meeting people and making new friends  free bicycles are also available making it very convenient to explore the nearby area. I definitely recommend staying here.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

GetCha Hostel & Bistro,"No. 166號, Yizhong St, North District, Taichung City, Taiwan 404",4.4,24.1541537,120.6871191,"Rooms are very small and not very comfortable or private. The location seems to be alright but the hostal itself is a bust. Not a great culture for backpackers. Location is good, walking distance to mall  YiZhong street but room is really too small. 4 bunk bed female room is like store room? And have to pay more compared to normal bunk bed room. Totally no walk space, feels suffocating. If u have a medium or big luggage, u cannot even open it up. Staff service are soso, no smile, very neutral. Nice hostel , room very small and dirty. Hostel on the city center I don't mean the people working at the hostel is not good, aside from checking in out service, there is no need of any service.
Room is the way so small, the smallest backpackers hostel I ever stayed.

I personally dont like the atmosphere, too dark, and barcode style of room key, look advanced tech, unfortunately not practical. If my cellphone run out of battery, I have to stay out whole evening. Risky. NO HOT WATER!!!

April 2022 Updating my review
A year and a bit later since I first stayed here, I figured it wasn't bad the first time. Great location and comfortable beds, so I decided to stay here again. Worst decision...   Although they had made some small improvements, such as new lockout curtains. The place is more rundown than last time!! Showers still dirty, now with yellow stains. Broken lift buttons with wornout signs. Dusty bench tops and malfunctioning QR code scanner for room key. However the staff are still friendly and helpful, but I feel like they are  over worked and under staffed. Level 7 female dorms was booked over capacity and most people I asked had no hot water to shower. Staff was very kind and apologetic but I believe this should not have happened in the first place. If it's an old building and limitations than management should cap reservations at what the hot water system can handle!! Not letting the staff having to deal with angry customers.

0ct 2020  Great location, just at the end of one of the main shopping eating streets. Facilities tho could do with a deep cleaning, shower head was mouldy and doors had stains. Decent soundproofing being on a busy street, comfortable bedding, although mattress are on the harder side. All in all good hostel, just needs some love and care, to improve.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 2:00 AM

Enjoy Hostel,"5 Rue des Plantes, 75014 Paris, France",3.5,48.83187100000001,2.324685000000001,"While location isn't all that central, it's a quiet area with everything you need around. It's also very easy to get to all the tourist sites. Rooms were clean and quiet, nothing extraordinary but nothing terrible either. The kitchen area was fine. There is only a microwave and a fridge but for a short stay this is enough. The service, however, was terrible. Staff at reception were always talking on the phone, not willing to communicate with guests. They weren't helpful, polite or friendly. Enjoy Hostel is approximately a 13 15 minutes walk from Gare Montparnasse or you could take the 98 bus line for 4 minutes and walk for 2 minutes to get to the hostel. The entrance is small so you might miss it. There is a bus stop 2 minutes away from the hostel and a tram stop about 6 minutes away.

The staff on duty that day was insightful and helpful and checked me in smoothly after I paid the night stay tourist tax or something. The lobby is okay, there are 2 sofas and a chair but there is seating in the accessible kitchen, which is moderately equipped with a sink, fridge, plates, a microwave etc. There is no elevator in this hostel, so climbing or however you go up a stairs, is what will happen.

The room I stayed in was an all female room with 3 females, including me. It was a clean room and it had a petite balcony. Space wise, it is that of a hostel. The lockers in the room were either broken because I could still open it after I used my  padlock or I couldn't work it. The bathroom was clean and small. One could complete their business successfully in there.

Checkout is quite easy as I just dropped my key at the front desk as I left super early.

All in all, my stay was smooth and I did expect what I got for the price I paid because it's Paris and Montparnasse and a hostel. The bedroom and the bathroom from the bedroom are ok.. the reception is almost all the time closed.. the toilet from the reception is very badly cleaned, no toilet paper. The door from the bedroom was broken, it is open all the time. Also other rooms were like that. We complained, but they did not fix it. perfectly ok for a night if you're catching a train from monty, or for a couple of nights if you're exploring the area. good points, the beds are comfortable and rooms are clean. staff fine. small lounge area, tiniest of gardens and a kitchen area. big school group when i was there, who were fine but it's not a place to meet travellers. perfectly reasonable for the price. wifi good The rooms were clean and the bathroom was spacious and comfortable. Staff were very nice to help out when my girlfriend and I were in different rooms on check in. Not a full kitchen which is unfortunate, near lots of metro stations and restaurants but a little out of the way from main attractions. Expensive but it is Paris and couldnt find anything with a similar price as nic as this one","Monday: Open 24 hours

Beimen WOW Poshtel,"No. 2-1號, Lane 92, Taiyuan Rd, Datong District, Taipei City, Taiwan 103",4.1,25.052234,121.5155,"My first time as solo traveler, and at my first day came in Taipei, i choosed this place as my stay. Made reservation in ladies area, i got upper bedroom, because the room already full with other guest, the staff told me i can moved when the other guest leave, but suprisingly i was okay.

The room had one bathroom and one toilet inside, got locker, and rooms sandals, the property didnt provide towel but you can paid for borrow it. If the bathroomtoilet occupied, you can use the bathroomtoilet outside. The bedroom reallt quiet, clean and tidy.

The pantrydining area also comfortable, big, and many seats available. Sadly, the washmachine was broke so i couldnt wash my clothes. But overall, the place really great. Stayed on the double room for 4 nights 812 Sept 2024. Room was small, facilities just OK. Got fridge, hair dryer, and coin laundry. Have large common area on the basement. It's located on relatively quiet neighbourhood so it's very good for sleeping. Just a bit temporary noise in the afternoon from the roadworks in front the hostel. Staff were accomodating and helpful even helps us to book bus ticket on Family Mart. Only 10mins walk to Taipei Main Station. Overall it's value for money for us. Pictures online not reflecting the actual dorms. Room was very small and it was hard to move around or even place the bags properly. Locker too small for a large bag. Sinks were in the room and right across from beds where people slept.
Common area was nice. If this is for a short stay, it is recommended. Around 5 minutes walk distance from Songshan station exit 6 and some cool bars around too. Soundproof needs to be improved, others are perfect. Love the basement where you can still stay there for a while after checking out. Staffs are friendly. I love this place close to one night market . Accessible to anything. Room is big enough. Just the wall is a bit thin you can hear people talking outside. They have free coffee and tea. Will stay there again for sure.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Trendy Hostel,"2ter Rue Edouard Vasseur, 94200 Ivry-sur-Seine, France",3.3,48.8148165,2.3775614,"Horrible place. I had my earrings taken off while I was asleep and robbed. There is no privacy so you are sleeping with at least 10 other people in the room.

There are multiple people sleeping in the lounge area overnight as well.

The price and reviews speak for itself and what type of people you are going to be surrounded by.

I have more to say but my review was censored.

You let people from other countries in and this is the result. Please DO NOT STAY HERE. I have done a lot of traveling this last year and stayed in some BAD hostels. This was VERY BAD. This was my younger sisters second hostel experience and, wow, what a way to deter her from traveling at all!

The rooms are disgusting. And Im saying this while fully knowing I have to go back and stay there AGAIN tonight. Fml.

The toilet is plugged beyond repair with feces and toilet paper everywhere. A random boy had to let me into the other room where the 2 other showers are located because the main one was nothing short of horrific.

The shower I used had a gap about a foot wide at the top of the shower door so anyone can look in at anytime and the drain was CLOGGED so water CAME UP and FLOWED INTO THE BATHROOM. I took no longer than 8 minutes to wash my hair and body and still ended up OVER ANKLE DEEP in the shower water.

When I confronted the woman at the front desk to tell her that the facilities are an abomination she simply shrugged at me and said I know before going back to the computer.

Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Do not do it PLEASE.

I thought of adding photos and videos, but honestly, I think I would throw up. I was robbed in my sleep. The pictures are nothing like the Hostel. Its very unclean, smells bad, and the people staying there are looking to steal things. This is not your average French establishment and does not represent the French people at all. This place holds refugees, beware. ""Unfortunately, my stay Trendy Hostel at  was disappointing. The room was not clean, and the bathroom facilities were subpar. The staff was unhelpful, and the overall atmosphere was not welcoming. I wouldnt recommend this place to others."" Please don't think about spending de 55 euro for a room. I payed 18 and that was still to much. Very, very filthy specialy the bathroom and 'kitchen'. I wish I read the reviews before..","Monday: Open 24 hours

輕旅背包客棧 LIGHT INN,"200, Taiwan, Keelung City, Ren’ai District, Aisan Rd, 87號六樓之一",4.6,25.12936299999999,121.7430812,"I highly recommend this place to stay. First thing to say is that the owner has been all the time taking care of me and willing to help, she is always smiling and checking if everything is alright. Also, they clean and take care of the place like it is their home, it is impressive. The furniture looks like new, everything is in a very good condition and decorated in a very nice way. The location is very good, very close to the station and the bus stop, also close to the popular night market of Keelung. Also, even if is is located near very busy streets you can not hear almost any noice. I am really happy with the time I spent here. Enjoyed a pleasant stay here in last Nov and overall, I would recommend it to fellow travelers. Booking a solo room with a window turned out to be a wise choice, as the room was cozy and wellkept. The shared bathroom facilities were also surprisingly clean, which added to the positive experience.

One of the highlights of the hotel is its convenient location, with easy access to the nearby night market, perfect for those wanting to explore the local scene.

However, there was one aspect of the stay that caught me off guard. Guests are required to put on the bed sheet and pillowcase themselves upon arrival and remove them upon checkout. While this may not be a big issue for some, it did come as a bit of a surprise to me and took away from the seamless experience I expected from a hotel stay.

Nevertheless, aside from this minor inconvenience, my overall experience was positive. The friendly staff, comfortable accommodations, and prime location make it a solid choice for travelers looking for a budgetfriendly option in the area. Excellent central location which is walking distance to anything you need. Clean roomsfacilities with quiet atmosphere. The staff are absolutely wonderful, very kind and friendly! I highly recommend for anybody staying in Keelung! The room itself is small but fine and with a relatively good view.
The bathrooms are clean but have little ventilation so it's always damp. You can use the washing machine for free but they also dry their clothes inside so the whole hostel is very, very humid. Our towels never got fully dry after showering. Even with the AC on it feels tropical not in a good way
There are Christian verses and signs everywhere. A bit unusual for my taste but not that dramatic. It's a clean and bright hostel. I have no issue putting on the bed linen myself. Very clean as the hosts are constantly monitoring the cleanliness of every corner. Guests are reminded to not shower or use the hair dryer after 11pm, and you may consequently find that everyone is trying to take a shower at 1030pm.
Free use of washer. Small drying area. Coin operated dryer. Free tea bags but the coffee machine is coinoperated. The hosts are willing to 'buy' coffees for guests but this was awkward to be repeatedly asking for coffee and only when the host is around. My opinion is that guests should be able to get complimentary coffee themselves.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Staff is really accommodating. Guests are given keycards to access their room and the elevators. The room is really clean and spacious, and the washrooms have hot water, and dispensers for soap and body wash. I originally booked a single bed in a dorm through Agoda, but I was upgraded to a double bed. You can leave your luggage here before and after your checkout time. You can rent bicycles for 100NTD for 4 hours. Great hostel, location right next to the trains. Common room is big and the front desk has bikes for rent and are very friendly Dorm room was quiet and comfortable It's near the train station, there are a couple options such as share rooms, private rooms, the safety is above everything, you can't enter the building without using their ECard.
The breakfast is included, it was fine, several choices of drinks, and some french toast with jams, on the first floor they have a cozy caffe, starting your with a cup of espresso, nothing can go wrong. Very nice hostel with friendly staff. They have a lot of creative interior designs, check it out yourself. Sort of fake and funny industrial loft decoration for a small room relatively expensive for what it is, a great common area with books and kitchen, a laundry area, basic ok breakfast and perfect location next to the bus and train station.

草悟道漂鳥青年旅館,"403, Taiwan, Taichung City, West District, Gongyi Rd, 201號8樓",4.6,24.150698,120.6605911,"A very nice and cozy hostel, the public area is very spacious. My only complaint is that there are not enough charging plugs, which sometimes makes me scramble for plugs last minute cuz all the seats with plugs are full. Also the toilet seats are a bit unstable, but otherwise very clean. The staff are pretty friendly and are quick and willing to help with all my problems, Umi is very kind and recommended a lot of awesome nearby restaurants. Will definitely come again I'm currently enjoying my stay at this charming hostel with a fantastic public space that exudes a cozy family environment. The welcoming atmosphere makes me feel right at home. Each morning, they offer a delicious breakfast that kicks off my day, and the highlight is a cup of coffee crafted by the super friendly front desk barista and receptionist, Rosina.

As the sign on the cup wisely states, 'Everyone has a memorable story.' I'm certainly making wonderful memories.

And a special thank you to Ms. Rosina for the wonderful cup of morning magic that starts my day on a high note. Positives nice staff, good atmosphere in lounge area, good and modern facilities, good shops around, felt clean

Negatives a little difficult to find, really far from train stations so adds a lot of extra time in your journey from wherever in Taiwan youre coming from, couldnt sleep during my stay with people being loud in my room past midnight  people coming in at 34 in the morning and turning lights on then not turning them back off  one loud snorer who was there every night, and the curtains for my bed didnt shut the whole way and there were lots of gaps  people kept looking in and seeing into my bed see picture

Overall not a good stay, went for this instead of cheaper hostels in better locations as it had good ratings so quite disappointed by this Really enjoyed this hostel stay. Bed cubes well sized and they have put on the pillow and bed sheet cases when you checked in. The ladies hostel room are exclusively at level 5 which I like the privacy, guys and mixed are level 6  7. While level 8 is the reception and hang out area. This area is spacious, fridge  basic kitchen wares provided. Good place to hang out. Highly recommended. The facilities are beyond my expectation! A well designed shower space and the bed is very comfy with a small surface above for items you don't want to crush while sleeping. The two layered personal locker is kind of a surprise too for easy storage. It might seem troublesome to need to take off shoes before entering the bedroom area, but I find it clean and shower friendly that way. The communal space is very accommodating. On top of all the goodness, it is located right on the main street!  I had a wonderful stay here.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:30 PM

FC Hostel,"No. 77, Zhongzheng Rd, Ruifang District, New Taipei City, Taiwan 224",4.0,25.10753,121.8055088,"Great location and very friendly and helpful owner who speaks great English. One improvement I can suggest would be to get some more comfortable beds as the ones there now are very uncomfortable for me, you can feel the springs sticking in your back. The host is very nice and fluent in English. They also have music night on FriSat if you want to chill and connect.

The location is peaceful because it's quite far from the center, but it's near other touristy attractions like Jiufen, Shifen, Leekung, Houtong.

The price is affordable and the dorm is clean, more comfortable if you're having Asian size. The hostel was okay.
Clean and I liked the boxes for each bed, which allowed for more privacy.

I was also given a coupon for a 40 discount for breakfast, which was nice got dumplings for 30 instead of 70.

But it was a bit weird how I was greeted, since I entered and was asked if I had any questions on the staircase instead of being welcomed and asked if I had a booking.
Not necessarily bad but while others praised the service, I found it just OK. Not bad at all though and still good for the cheap price. Just one cramped room with way too many mini cubicles, bad matress, bad ""blanket"", Is there no minimum standard in Taiwan for lodging establishments ? The owner was kind and the room was priced.  At night, the boss played the piano and sang well.

SleepBox Hotel,"No. 34號, Hengyang Rd, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan 10045",3.8,25.042221,121.512555,"This hostel is really dated and not clean nor maintained. We stayed in a bunk bed room with shared bath for 2 people. Room was extremely tight for us. We each have 1 piece of midsized luggage. You may consider this place If you are a backpacker who just needs a place to shower and sleep for 1 night. Location is good. I could say that the hotel is accessible to the metro station but the room was small maybe that's why it's called sleepbox hotel. There's a smell inside the room that we can't figure out. They have provided only one towel knowing that we were two and we asked for a slipper but we have to pay 10. They were giving free coupons of their neighbor caf but we need to write a good review for us to get the coupon and I was like. Improve your service first then only we will write a good review. Why do we need to write a good review just to get the coupon??? Scammers Hostel!!!!
I booked this hostel through Klook and it seemed like a good location in Taipei, but it turned out to be a nightmare for me. The booking instructions said to inform the property if I arrived late. I sent emails to inform them about my late arrival due to a flight delay, but I received no response. I also messaged Klook when I arrived at the property and tried to call the hotel numbers, but no one answered. I arrived at 230 am, hoping to have a place to relax, but I ended up waiting in the lobby until 400 am with no response from either emails or calls. Unfortunately, the reception only opened at 1000 am. I decided to go to another hostel where I was supposed to stay for the next 3 days. I emailed the original hostel, but they said they would charge me an additional 200 Taiwan dollars for the late arrival does not refund my payment, even though I didn't even use the rooms. This rule seems ridiculous. I got one of the Boxes that are just a bed. It was actually really sick. The place is clean, but a little walk from the MRT station but not a big deal without a roller bag. Also its really close to all the fun stuff in  The hotel is close to the center of Taipei and there is a 24hour convenience store nearby, which is very convenient. I will stay here again next time I come to Malaysia. The staff are also very attentive and polite.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM

light hostel,"No. 622號, Guangcai St, West District, Chiayi City, Taiwan 600",4.3,23.4777473,120.4440524,"Stayed two nights here in a double bed room. The rooms are small but fit for purpose.

Pros
 Great location from the trainbus station within walking distance
 Clean linen and room except for the scuff marks on the walls of the room
 Luggage lift
 Staff were helpful

Cons
 Pricy relative to rest of Taiwan and size of room
 Shower is not closed off from rest of bathroom, meaning the bathroom gets very wet from a shower. Recently stayed end May in a double bed room, and found it to be a mixed experience.

On the positive side, the hostel offers some great amenities for travelers. The kitchen is wellequipped, making it easy to prepare your own meals, although it feels somewhat redundant given the availability of affordable food in the city. The fun room is a nice touch, providing great space to relax and socialize with other guests. Additionally, the convenience of getting any amount of towels you need is great and adds to the comfort of the stay.

However, my stay was significantly marred by cleanliness issues. I encountered more than 10 flying termites in the room despite all windows closed  which was quite unsettling. This really impacted my overall experience and pulled my rating down to a 3. If the hostel could address the pest problem, it would be a much more enjoyable place to stay. Extremely central location, with warm reception. The rooms are small but there's a toilet within each room which I really appreciated. There's a balcony on the highest level where you can hang soiled clothes as well. Extremely value for money! I'm sorry to give bad reviews but just consider that as things to know before booking, might be a problem for me but non for everyone 

 No elevator
 Only in the dorm bathroomshower and no shared ones. Can be a problem with 4 people
 The reception was nice but didn't speak English so well and has very limited hours 1018 Pictures are a bit deceiving. The 4 beds, female only room I was assigned to was cramped and small with a restroom. The restroom door doesn't close from the outside so when someone finish using the bathroom, the smell will travel into the room. The room was already stuffy but the restroom made it worst. Not clean nor COVID safe. My reservation at Light Hostel was for 2 nights but I quickly booked another hostel and decided to forego the 2nd night.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:30 PM

Sleeping Boot Backpacker Hostel,"No. 73號, Jinfeng St, Hualien City, Hualien County, Taiwan 970",4.8,23.9861767,121.6065103,"I traveled solo and stayed here. I feel very comfortable. They have shared kitchenette and lounge. The place is quiet and accessible to all . The price is also affordable. I stayed here in 2020 and it became my home in Taiwan. I came back 4 times! The staff was incredible and it was very comfortable to stay there even for longer periods of time. Close to everything. One of the best hostels I've done, the guest might be a bit loud or obnoxious sometimes, but the place itself is really nice.
I would really recommend it for solo travelers or small groups.

The owner is really nice and speaks many languages , , ..., moreover if you're European, you'll feel right at home as the aesthetic and atmosphere of the place feels very similar. Its only about 10 minutes from the station.
There are some restos too around, so its not difficult to find food.

The staff is really helpful too and quite responsive when you contact them on the WhatsApp before your coming.

They also have small kitchen where you able to cook.
Its really a good value for money Really great hostel! Two people room is great and the shared area is perfect to work. The hostel is bikefriendly. The staff is very kind and the owner even speaks a little bit of French!

Air con worked well.
Rooms are tiny but most people staying here are going to the national park anyway so its not like you spend much time in the room.
Dont know why everyones making such a fuss in the reviews, if you pay 10 a night its not going to be the Ritz! All good reviews are fake. There is 100NTD reward for good review.
1 No wifi in the bedrooms. Only available on ground floor.
2 The bathroom had the black mold.
3 Smallest room I have ever seen. No space for bags in the room. There is only space for the bed.
4 This is more like a dorm, there is no privacy. There is 1 meter gap at the top of the door. You can hear all your neighbors even if they whisper.
5 DThere is a notice in the bedrooms which says 'Not allowed phones, laptops, eating, speaking, farting, nudity'.
This place is like a prison. Especially good for
The persons, who loves moskyto inside the house and rooms, noises from the street and restaurant and others rooms and bathroom. If you sell bad place you can't fixed it with free earplugs or ""friendly"" shields ""lost key 100, blocked toilet 2000!"" Inside is not like on pictures. WiFi is slow and not every time available at 3rd Floor. But it was really nice cleaned.
Everybody, who cames in a night get trought locking, which made noises like a bell. This is not normal. The room is very small, especially bed is too short no more than 170 cm.
For this price we slept in so amazing place in Taipei.
I do NOT recommend.
Its really self servise. Internet interaction and registration was fine, but presumption of not having paid didn't feel good. Why not prior check before assuming room is not paid.
Be aware no guests below 18 years allowed and unfriendly and simply unacceptable 10am checkout.
The room is totally filled with a bed, no floor space.

Bathroom and shower clean as well and sheets and towel. There no service since it's self checking. The room was small and dirty  lot of bugs on the wall . Not many place to put our luggage. The bathroom wasn't clean enough, I didn't feel safe inside. Lot of noise since the room's wall isn't complety close... I saw that there were a campaign for guests. Like putting a good review on internet to get discount and money ! So I understand why it get such good review ....",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The guys on reception were always really friendly and happy to offer recommendations etc. Checkin process nice and easy, dorms and shower rooms were clean and wellkept, with most needed amenities! Location was great too, right next to the MRT! This place checks all the boxes.  Clean, Easy Access, ROOF PATIO, comfortable, friendsly, CLEAN, EASY Access, Roof Patio, WiFi, 2Shots, kitchen access.  FEMALE ONLY FLOOR !  I am here for 5 nights.  The Dorm Style space is clean, airy, cool, comfortable.

Go up to 4th floor if you need an extra washroom or some space.  Very quiet up here, and a gorgeous outside roof patio.

The staff is very accommodating, the price is right.

I am traveling alone, in Taiwan for 2 weeks, from US, over 55, a woman, and I am so pleased with this place.

WHITE CLEAN BED LINENS can really make a girls day!

I stayed at another Taipei hostel last week, this one takes it up more than one notch.  I feel like I'm at home. It is not crowded this week, so that for sure makes it more pleasant.

Shares a locationDoor with Two Shots Cafe BRIGHT red sign makes it so easy to find. Stayed for 4 nights, you have a small space yourself and mini hanging space plus a locker. 2 shower and 2 toilets. When the room is full it can be a little noisy but acceptable! Staff would open the window in the day to air the room. Staff is friendly  helpful! Taipei 101 is visible with few mins walk. Definitely good for staying for a few days, especially if you plan to be out often.

Mosquitoes get into the room in rainy days, but should be minimal.

The staff were extremely helpful, friendly, and sweet.

Bathrooms are crowded especially during morning and evening times, but going to the 4th floor alleviates that issue. I've stayed in many many hostel in the past months all over Asia and I can say this is the best out of all of them !
It's super clean, the bed are spacious and very comfortable, you even have a place for you couple clothes and stuff in the bed. The bathroom is scrubbed everyday and the shower are spacious and super practical.
Location is in the cutest neighborhood and it's super easy to go anywhere from there.
The staff is so nice, always willing to help you out and sharing with you about their culture and city.

Norden Ruder Hostel,"400, Taiwan, Taichung City, Central District, Jianguo Rd, 123號12樓",4.6,24.137523,120.6840439,"My family of 5 booked two standard rooms and one single bed in a dormitory. All our rooms were extremely clean and very welldesigned for a hostel, and we had no soundproofing issues. The hostel takes 7F12F in a building right next to Taichung Station and each floor has a beautiful commonseating area that overlooks the station. In addition, 12F and the rooftop have larger common areas with free tea and snacks and lots of seating. The hostel has been designed with a lot of care every room has a notebook with the ""story of the room"" written by previous guests, and it made our stay really special. Would come back again in a heartbeat and stay for longer! We booked a 4bed dormitory and a standard double room for our family. The place was very easy to find upon exiting the Taichung train station. The aesthetic of the entire hostel was also very pleasing and clean.

They have clear guidelines for the use of the common space and rules on keeping quiet at night. The rooms are all secure since you need your keycard access to be able to enter the private room areas. Its also very clean since everyones asked to change to room slippers upon exiting the elevator!

Highly recommend and I would definitely book again next time I visit!

Bonus Miyahara is just around the corner!  Honestly, the best hostel Ive stayed at ever. Everything was clean. The place was quiet and everything was well thought of. The beds were comfy.

The place is also accessible. There are convenience stores, coffee shops nearby  including the famous Miyahara ice cream shop. The train station is literally in front of the hotel.

The rooms come with a 100 meal couponday for nearby restaurants. We stayed at a private double bedroom. The room was clean and functional, good price at a good location. Communal spaces were also clean and organized at all times. A little late review
I  stayed at Norden Ruder in February 2023 for 4 Nights. I had booked an economy double room which is the basic room but i think the hostel upgraded me since my room had a fantastic corner view of the city. The room was clean, spacious and impeccable when i checked in. The bathroom and the toilet were separate which would be wonderful if you are travelling with someone. The check in process was such a breeze. The staff was so welcoming and made it a quick check in. The hostel has a wonderful common area near the reception with a little kitchenette but unfortunately i wasn't able to use it much since i was hoping in and out a lot. It is a great place to mingle with people if you are looking for company.

The hostel is located right across the train station and everything is easily accessible by just walking. I went on a vegan food trail in a night market near the hostel and it was a blast.

The rooms are located on different floors to the reception  common area and you need a key to access you floor which makes it super secured vital concern when you are solo travelling female. The best part was that they have put a couple of tables and chair at each floor near the windows overlooking the city where you can have a peaceful meal which is exactly what i did on my last night. This is one of the best Hotel because it does not even feel like a hostel i have been to in my 10 years of Solo travelling. I cannot recommend it enough and if i ever end up in the city, i will stay here again!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:30 PM

Was traveling with my wife and 3 dogs and it was the only place that accepted the dogs. The ownerhost is an animal lover which was very nice!
I highly recommend Dian Dian hostel to everyone and we'll stay there again when we return! At 450 TWD for a bed in a 4bed dorm, it's probably the best hostel I've ever stayed at. The mixed dorm room was full but, since it was late, the owner let me stay in the femaleonly room. The hostel is very well taken care of, and the owner is one of the best hostel owners I've ever met. We talked for hours about scuba diving and traveling. And he gave me some very useful tips of places to visit and restaurants to eat at. It was wonderful. This hostel might be a little ways away from the city center, but its an excellent stay in Puli. The host was friendly and welcoming, and gave us travel tips for the area nearby. The rooms were furnished with cozy wooden furniture. The bathrooms were clean and brightly lit, although they did get cold at night this was February. The property has a lot of character and I would definitely come back again the next time Im in Puli.

Dont miss the the propertys three cats! Apparently the hostel is named after the owners late cat, . Fantastic place with a lovely owner

The hostel is very stylishly decorated and spotless clean. The owner is incredibly kind and helpful and nice to chat with. He even took me to the bus station after I checked out.

I would absolutely recommend anyone to stay here and I will be returning here in the future! Cozy, neat, old fashioned dcor mixed with post modern fusions and then some! It must the best hostel in town! Foreign tourists are surely welcome. No language barrier.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 11:30 PM

WOW HOSTEL,"108, Taiwan, Taipei City, Wanhua District, Hanzhong St, 42號8樓",3.8,25.044218,121.50734,"Wow Hostel exceeded my expectations with its clean and modern facilities. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, always ready to assist with any questions. The location was convenient, close to public transport and popular attractions. Overall, its a fantastic budgetfriendly option for travelers looking for a comfortable stay. Love the beer. The room size was good. The cleanliness was acceptable. The location was great but the elevator was a bit of a mystery to find. But my main issue was the noise. The wall was not enough to cancel the noise outside. Also people in my room went in and out too much even though it was 1am already. I slept next to the AC which was too cold. I didn't dare to ask for change because there is only one AC in the room. I was afraid others might feel hot. Not really a good experience for that one night but for a short stay I think it's okay but not for a long stay I guess. I recently had the pleasure of staying at Wow Hostel in Taipei, and it was an unforgettable experience! From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warmth and hospitality by the friendly staff. Their eagerness to help and genuine kindness made me feel right at home.

The location of Wow Hostel is simply perfect. Nestled in a vibrant neighborhood, its just a short walk away from some of Taipeis best attractions, local eateries, and convenient public transportation. This made exploring the city incredibly easy and enjoyable.

The hostel itself is beautifully maintained and has a charming, cozy atmosphere. The common areas are inviting and perfect for meeting fellow travelers. I particularly loved the rooftop terrace, which offered stunning views of the city and was a great spot to relax after a day of sightseeing.

My dorm room was clean, comfortable, and wellorganized. Each bed had its own reading light and power outlet, ensuring a comfortable stay. The lockers provided ample space for my belongings, and the overall cleanliness of the facilities was impeccable.

Wow Hostel truly goes above and beyond in making sure guests have a wonderful experience. Their attention to detail, welcoming environment, and the sense of community they foster make it a top choice for anyone visiting Taipei. I cant recommend it highly enough and will definitely be returning on my next trip to this amazing city! Good budget hostel with very cosy common area. Toilet and showers are a little cramped but makes up for it with super convenient location and cheap price.

Make sure to grab a set of free earplugs for better sleep. Wow Hostel provided a comfortable and welcoming stay throughout our 6 nights. The rooms were clean and wellmaintained, offering good amenities for budget travelers. The staff was friendly and helpful, providing useful local tips and ensuring our needs were met promptly. The location was convenient, with easy access to public transportation and nearby attractions. Overall, Wow Hostel offered great value for money and contributed to a pleasant stay in insert city name. Would recommend for travelers looking for affordable and cozy accommodation.Will definitely come back!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Backpack 41 Youth Hostel - Taichung,"No. 59號, Jiguang St, Central District, Taichung City, Taiwan 400",3.9,24.1384691,120.6818094,"Hostel with very nice location in front of 711 and 5 min walk from train station. Cozy common area where it's easy to meet others backpackers. It has shared mixed bathrooms for both genders so be aware.
One thing important for foreign backpackers local guests will leave very early in the morning 67am and make a lot of noise everyday, also cleaning staff will absolutely violate the room at 11 with a vacuum cleaner and turn off ac until 3. So be aware if you're someone waking up easily and want to sleep in. At first glance, the hostel appeared to be modern and well equipped. The staff members did not speak any English to me at checkin even though I could only communicate in English. Maybe they did not wish to have any nonChinese speaking customers? When I got to the dorm at 4 pm, I found no space to put my luggage. There were toe nail and dead skin pieces on the bed sheet. Staff members did not attempt to solve problems but instead would tell the complaining guest to leave the property immediately. There was no hospitality shown whatsoever. They seemed to care more if the front door was closed properly than to find ways to improve the level of their service. To save yourself aggravation, just avoid this place.
Their deragatory reply proves my points exactly. The hostel was in general good. It was clean and the staff was friendly and speaks both English and Chinese. Also the prices per night is cheap. The hostel does not provide place to put your suitcase, but offers lockers to place your valuables like, wallet, smartphone, laptop etc. There is a 711 close to the hostel if you need to eat or drink something during nights and the train station and bus station is also not far away like 510 min by walk. It is a place that is good for backpackers and people that loves travelling alone.

The only thing that i think the could improve is to set up rules during nighttimes. Because the last night i stayed there, there was like 45 tenants going back and forth the room from 11pm3am, slaming the doors, playing video games with headphones, opening their backpacks and suitcases and started packing which made anxious for theftfortunately neither of the tenants opened my suitcase and stole my belongings and could not sleep. I know that Stealing in Taiwan is extremely rare and the staff told me so when i arrived there. But they should put up rules e g. It should be quiet from 11pm to 7am or reminding to keep the volume down from 11pm to 7am. The location is convenient, the water pressure is sufficient, and the service staff is friendly. They provide body wash and shampoo, while other personal items you need to bring by yourself.  However, the hostel should be more careful about the cleanliness of the room. After taking off the pillow case, the pillow center is yellow, and there is garbage beside the bed , really hope that the cleanliness will be strengthened. Location was really good and so was the staff which helped me extend and booked my hostel directly for Kaohsiung.

The commom area doesnt welcome people to sit and chat and they should have some sofas and more comfy area to chill, also rooftop has so much unused potential for a rooftop and chill area.

The accommodation is in a good location only five minutes from the train station, it is cheap but the room is very dark and there is no soundproofing Comfortable place to sleep. It is close to food court and train station. So many food sellers nearby. If you stay here, you won't see the owner, bcs it is a self service homestay.

It only has water dispenser and refrigerator. bed is very soft.  room is a bit small.  convenient travel The holiday price for a quadruple room on the third floor is 2100
The house is old and poorly soundproofed

The air conditioner is an antique. When it is turned on, it makes a loud sound that can be heard in the stairwell on the first floor!
After reaching a fixed temperature, the sound is acceptable
But as soon as the temperature drops, the thunderous sound starts again
And it's the kind that would scare you if there was a sudden loud noise.
We had to turn off the air conditioner before going to bed
But without the air conditioning, it was so stuffy that I couldnt sleep!

The bed looked clean, but the two friends kept feeling itchy on their exposed skin, so they had to wear long pants to sleep!

The biggest advantage here is the location!
But also because of the location, there is constant noise from vendors and tourists on the first floor.
Coupled with the poor sound insulation, the noise from the tenants on the second floor is quite clear.

There are free boardgames and black coffee at the ground floor so it's good to go with friends. There is also a lock room to keep your luggage after checking out.

The rooms are separated by genders but not the floors so I was a bit shocked to see males when I just finished showering. Great location, near MRT station and sight seeing places. Clean facilities and friendly English speaking staff. Good for short staying guests like cyclists. Foreigners like me need to understand that Taiwanese dont really consider breakfast as the most important meal of the day so better buy outside food to supplement the coffee, tea and toast they serve.

Affordable price room.  Great customer service  Great This time I stayed at a hotel with mixed reviews online.
The shops around the Fengjia Night Market all have parking lots.
This time it was parked at Kaixuan 1st Street Station
After parking, you have to call the management unit to notify
For only NT120, you can park for 12 hours with unlimited entry and exit.
It takes about 1015 minutes to walk from the parking lot to the designated location.
The path is flat and surrounded by highrise buildings
So dont worry about Father Suns enthusiasm
and the inconvenience caused by dragging luggage
This feels a bit like a mission

OK
After completing all the above tasks
Finally met the NPC and took us to the room where we stayed.

Todays room is located on the first floor
Room number is 101
Feeling quite lucky
Because the store informed in advance
There is no elevator
Must rely on feet

So lets start with a brief introduction
Electronic locks for entry and exit doors
Two pairs of magnetic buckles and keys are provided for each room
Be sure to close your front teeth when entering or exiting

The first impression upon entering the room was not bad.
Whether its room decoration or furnishings,
Just simple
There are two double beds, TV, air conditioner, refrigerator, hair dryer, double sofa and coffee table.

This personal stay experience part
1 It is recommended to carry simple luggage to avoid adding burden when walking, or suddenly forgetting to pick up something. This section of the journey will make people want to give up!

2WIFI is provided in all rooms

3The water pressure in the bathroom is strong, clean and scalefree
The disadvantage is that the floor tiles next to the drainage holes on the floor are quite protruding, so be careful not to cut your feet.
The washbasin is low, so when you wash your face, you will get wet all over your body.

4The bed adopts an independent tube, which has good support in the middle. However, the edge of the bed is too soft, and the down pillow is also soft, which can easily cause stiff neck or make sleeping uncomfortable. Friends who have high sleep quality requirements should think about it!

5Because the room cannot be exposed to sunlight and ventilation, the smell of humidity is excessive. If you have friends with respiratory allergies, I strongly remind you to pay attention!

6The sound insulation effect is pretty good, because there are only two rooms on the first floor, but there will be lowfrequency noise problems in the middle of the night, the sound of the air conditioner running and the water tower motor. Friends should also be reminded to pay attention to this!

7The accommodation is located in the alley of Fengjia Night Market, only a twominute walk, so happy!

8The store does not provide meals and drinking water. Please remind your friends to bring their own or buy it at a convenience store. The store only provides a water dispenser. Whether you use this or not depends on each person!

Frankly speaking, with
Room rate for four people per night is 2,700 yuan
Plus parking fee 120 yuan
The average price per person is about 700 yuan
In exchange, visit Fengjia Night Market for your visit
Don't worry about parking
Don't worry about getting lost
Although there are some shortcomings

But if you can accept the above
This is also a good point!","Monday: 12:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Double room is clean and just enough space for two.  The staff was accomodating, he did his best to communicate with us thru google translate. Overall stay was great, will definitely book again here. Good location just behind the train station, very quiet. The capsules are lovely and clean, they arent soundproof of course but everyone tries to keep quiet. The bathroom is clean too and has sufficient warm water. Highly recommend for backpackers Our group stayed for 1 night in June 23, the best decision we made for this chiayi trip. Staff are the most accommodating especially the manager he speaks English and made us feel very at home. Hostel is clean even the common areas. Beds are comfortable and area is secured with pass codes. Amazing aesthetic design of the place for instagram. Its also the best location, few steps away from the rear station of Chiayi. Highly recommended! Will be back for sure. Great place to stay and explore Chiayi! Excellent base to go to Yushan and Alishan!
Many thanks to the staff for taking me to the hospital on a Sunday after I fell of my bicycle! They rock! Very nice and modern hostel with big bed, nice staff and all u need for a good stay in this city.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Flip Flop Hostel - Garden,"No. 122號, Chang'an W Rd, Datong District, Taipei City, Taiwan 103",4.3,25.05054,121.518145,"I have stayed in both a women's dorm and a double room with shared bath on 2 occasions. Double room was very spacious. My experience was great, rooms, beddings  with high quality duvet and pillows and bathrooms were clean and fresh. Breakfasts were tasty provided by the adjoining cafe.

The building itself is super cool with lots of natural lights. Staff is always keeping up with cleanliness of the common kitchen area. I would suggest a few more plugins for charging in the common area though, as I only saw 4 of them.
I will stay at Flip Flop again for sure. Overall the hostel was ok, clean and in a good condition. Also the staff is really kind and helpful! Still, I wouldn't come back next time.

However, there are many things that really annoyed me
 Definitely too little storage space in the rooms. Although the beds provided quite a lot of storage, there was no space to put your backpack. And the rooms had no trash cans!
 The beds were too short, at least for s 185cm tall guy, my feet poke out of the privacy curtains!
 The showers are really tiny and it's hard to even squeeze in with your changing clothes
 Putting the used toilet paper in a bin is really disgusting and smelly although it's quite common here
 When I book ""breakfast included"" for a hostel stay, I'd expect it to be included and not only a voucher for a discount. The breakfast is way below average  it's just as good as the convenience sandwiches. And it had not many veggi options
 Hostel guests were not really wellseen in the restaurant or the book store from my point of view. In the boon store you have to buy some snacks or drinks when you want to sit there during business hours. While I can understand it, it's still annoying because I already paid enough money for the hostel itself in my opinion.

Overall, the concept of the hostel is amazing, however it severely lacks in practice. Had an amazing stay! Super clean facilities and room. Friendly staff and central location! Highly recommend Staffs are very friendly and welcoming. Location is convenient. I stayed in a 4 people dorm and the bed is clean and neat. Theres a medium side locker beside the bed but no larger locker for my luggage. One down side is that common area is not that big, more like a kitchen. The other hang out spots like sofas are in another bookstore which you have to pay a small price to use. Excellent hostel. Clean and very comfortable Emma mattress beds, kitchen bookshop, cafe, breakfast with the room, cheap coffee, washing machine, gifts. One of the most convenient hosteks ever for location and facilities as well as cleanliness.","Monday: 9:30 AM – 9:30 PM

Lovely stay as a weekend getaway What a Great Place to chill and Surf! We had a great stay af the Wave Backpackers! The staff is super friendly and helpful!

This place is run by nicest people I met in Taiwan! Learned to surf for the first time, had great time exploring nearby neighborhood thanks to very helpful guides from the hosts. I can't recommend this place enough, and will definitely come back here in the near future

 Mikey Great stay, the manager was very nice and gave me a a cheesy bagel along with the blueberry muffin to eat at breakfast. The hostel was partially built by the owner's hands, the bed frames, bar counter, some sitting area tables.

It's clean, so clean, it turns out I was the only one wearing indoors slippers, the other four didn't. Awesome hostel! New, modern, best value hostel. super friendly staff, big beds, close to surf spots. Will return ever time I'm surfing in the area","Monday: 3:00 – 9:00 PM

Star Hostel Taichung Parklane 誠星青年旅館,"403, Taiwan, Taichung City, West District, Gongyi Rd, 68號15樓",4.5,24.1512354,120.663848,"Incredible hostel in Taichung! I have stayed here multiple times over the last six months and it has been by far the best hostel I have ever stayed in. Super clean with incredible amenities. Special shoutout to Cara and Luna, who have been incredibly hospitable and helpful during my stay. Highly recommend!  I had the pleasure of staying at this hostel during my trip to Taiwan, and I cant recommend it enough. The hostel itself was very clean, comfortable, and ideally located in the heart of Taichung. The facilities were well maintained, and the common areas had a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere that made it easy to meet other travelers.

However, what really made my stay outstanding was the incredible staff, particularly Yvonne. As someone unfamiliar with the city, I was worried about getting around, especially using public transportation or the popular Ubike system. Yvonne was an absolute lifesaver! She went above and beyond, offering me tons of helpful advice on how to commute efficiently as a firsttime visitor. She patiently explained bus routes, how to rent and use the citys uBikes, and even suggested some lesserknown areas worth exploring.

Thanks to Yvonnes guidance, I was able to navigate the city with ease, which made my trip all the more enjoyable. Whether youre a seasoned traveler or new to the area like I was, her local insights will surely enhance your experience.

If youre looking for a place that offers not just a bed, but genuine support and advice on making the most of your trip, this is definitely the hostel to stay at! The location is the best, on top of the a shopping mall. Plenty of attractions and restaurants nearby. I love the inner design and the overall sustainable concept of the hostel. They tried to use localreusable materials wherever is possible. Food and beverage are not allowed inside the room. However, you can enjoy them in the beautiful common area with natural sunlight and great view of the park and the city. One thing to improve is the breakfast.  Only one option per day and honestly the food is not tasty. Probably hands down the best hostel I've stayed at thus far! Shout out to Cara and Luna who are always smiling to welcome us back from our travels. Highly recommend! Pros
1 Good location, very close to surrounding good cuisines and green spaces.
2 The hostel environment is really relieving with good amount of plants, especially the common area.
3 The staff is friendly with swift assistance made.
4 Breakfast included, dishes are different everyday, vegan and vegetarian options are available, breakfast is available in four different timeslots.

Cons
1 The lift waiting is amazingly long as it locates at the top of the building.
2 There are plenty of stairs to reach the rooms from the lobby.
3 It locates not that close to any bus or metros, or other public transits.
4 There's a strange scent and the ventilation isnt't too great in the room.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Hostel Tomato 番茄溫泉青旅,"No. 10號, Wenquan Rd, Jiaoxi Township, Yilan County, Taiwan 262",4.7,24.8273526,121.7749911,"I used to overlook this place because its literally next to the train station and now stayed here twice  double room with a friend external bathroom and private room with a tub. I highly recommend! In Taiwan, hostels can sometimes be nicer than hotels, and thats very true of Jiaoxi where hotels are marked way up for the hotspring but also loud bad soundproofing, tubs draining all hours, lots of large groupsdrunk lads on tour vibe. TBH the outdoor communal rooftop onsen is better than a lot of hotspring hotels Ive visited. There are noises here like doors opening and stuff but the vibe is overall chill and I was able to work remotely. The real  is the cat, Oreo, and many things are designed around himher. Generally speaking the others reviews are on point.
Perfect location, perfect rooms  if you didn't book a dorm, perfect environment, with some areas of improvement such as their locks. Their electric smart lock pads are not the most sensitive so it takes some effort. Beyond that this hotel easily has one of the highest cp Value I can think of. 1110. Right outside Jiaoxi station, the perfect first hostel bunk experience for me. Very clean and aesthetic amenities. Only small gripe is the mattress is too thin but would definitely stay here again without a doubt. It is a very well kept and well managed hostel.  Very clean and location is next to the train station.  I strongly recommend. A really nice and comfort place to stay. But it definitely could be better.
The electric door lock was out of battery, and even if we did change the battery, the buttons are really hard to press. And there were some construction noises in the early morning, it was loud and clear that woke me up from my dream. I dont think its their fault, but I do believe they should have know this beforehand and inform us. Since we are paying about almost 3000 ntd for a night, I think a quiet room is the least we should get.
But still, the environment is clean and the location is so convenient, is a decent place to stay for a night if you are a deep sleeper.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
The People Belleville,"59 Bd de Belleville, 75011 Paris, France",4.4,48.8700278,2.378914599999999,"The hostel is scrupulously clean, wellequipped and staffed by cheerful, helpful and very kind people. The wheelchairaccessible room we were provided was a decent size, with enough room to park the wheelchair and still move around and also get into the bathroom fairly easily. The brunches onsite are delicious and highly recommended. The staff were extremely kind with my young daughter, who was accompanying me and other guests were equally friendly and kind. The fact there is a lift to all floors meant the accommodation was also wheelchairaccessible throughout, with flat access via the rear door from the outdoor terrace area.

The ""vibe"" of The People is fantastic and I would highly recommend this as a costeffective, safe, clean and accommodating place to stay in Paris. It has good transport connections via bus and Metro, though we did not use this and so is easy to get to from the main transport hubs, and not too long by bus into central Paris.

The only improvements would be specifically from the perspective of a wheelchair user. The shower area was too small and poorly designed for a disabled user. The risk of water flooding out of the shower was high and this causes safety concerns. There was no emergency pull cord anywhere in the bathroom or room. The portable shower stool provided was fine for me, but would not be suitable for many disabled people. The People should consider redesigning the wheelchairaccessible bathroom as a proper wet room with level access and a larger shower area, and installing emergency pull cords in the bedroom and bathroom areas. I had a good stay. The room was comfortable and offered privacy. They are small and at 1030 3 housekeepers came while two of us were still trying to pack for check out. We were all on top of each other, it was not pleasant. I would suggest waiting until after guests leave to clean rooms. Otherwise the terrace is lovely and I slept well. I forgot to take photos of this dorm but it was nice in terms of price. I got a bed in a 8bed dorm and shared bathroom and it was not too bad. You will have to pay the city tax when you check in and definitely take the earplugs because there can be a lot of noise at night both from your roommates and the street
You will have a small cabin to store your things and you can rent a padlock for a fee. They will give you a small free welcome drink which I thought was pretty nice. However, I didnt like that my bed was occupied by another roommate and got to ask reception to help me with that. Other than that, I think its a good place if you just need to shower and sleep at night I really loved the location of this hostel.  So much interesting ethnic diversity in this neighbourhood.  Endless amazing food options.  The facilities and rooms were all very clean. The staff were super helpful and friendly.  The espresso was also exceptional. Its a cool vibe inside like if you where in a hipster caf. The staff are nice and the views from the rooftop are amazing. A perfect place if you work remotely. The beds are really comfy. The unique thing to say that when you are for recommendation to do or to go like restaurants and activities the staff have no idea about it.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 12:00 AM

St Christopher's Inn Paris Canal,"159 Rue de Crimée, 75019 Paris, France",3.9,48.88850499999999,2.3790066,"Coldbarely lukewarm showers by 930pm, with nowhere dry to stand and change. Timed taps that are so short you need one hand free at all times to press them! Lockers large but very loud and inconvenient. Friendly staff but lots of issueskey card stopped working on day 2 for no reason which was an easy fix at reception but shouldnt have happened and was difficult on a day I was already cold and wet. Lounge tiny and with poor facilitiesone microwave with a broken light and a paid coffee machine, not that many places to sit. Laundry also small. Overall liveable for a few days but the worst hostel I have stayed in so far. Daily activities e.g. wine tasting is appreciated but no real infocultural knowledge on the wine, just a couple of glasses to drink and a cheese platter. Fine but not great by any stretch. Positive points

The location is really ideal, right next to the metro, which makes getting around very easy. There are also many small shops, restaurants, and supermarkets just a few steps away, which is very convenient.

The hotel is clean, whether its the rooms, the bathrooms, or the showers, everything is wellmaintained.

The common area is a real plus with a TV, microwave, and tables for eating or working. It's perfect for those who want to relax in peace.

Special mention to the terrace, which is really pleasant, especially in the afternoon, for unwinding.

Negative points

Unfortunately, a strong smell of cigarette smoke in the room was quite unpleasant.

In the morning, the noise from the cleaning staff chatting in the hallways can be disturbing if you're trying to sleep in. First issue is BED BUGS! I woke up to over a dozen small red bite marks from being eaten alive during my sleep. The showers are cold and no way to adjust the temperature. Toilets dont flush completely so theres paper or feces at any given time. Bathroom was out of hand soap during my entire stay. And lastly, the dark skinned girl with curly hair at the front charged my card for the 2 key fee without my consent. She never explained
the fee nor ask if I wanted to pay in cash. She just took it upon herself to charge my card. I only realized this after I received a cash refund for 2 at checkout. Furthermore, the heavyset girl and the security guards are overall very unpleasant. The entire demeanor of the staff is they are only there to do the bare minimum to receive a paycheck. Shameless and unscrupulous business. Clogged drains in the shower, little to no privacy with walls you can easily look over, and with peek holes on either side ! Luke warm water.
Women's bathrooms are not locked from the outside with cards so I wouldn't feel very safe here as a woman.
Large rooms, terrible storage lockers which make so much noise you'll need ear plugs to sleep, which you can probably but at reception for a ""small"" fee. I get that this place is super cheap, but the standard is even lower than you'd expect. Staying with 10 people in such a small room was not so pleasant. Yes, I chose it because the price was affordable, but there was no ventilation in the room at all. This aspect was bad, and the hygiene was quite poor. However, the price was reasonable and the location was good.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Auberge de jeunesse Fourcy - MIJE Marais,"6 Rue de Fourcy, 75004 Paris, France",4.1,48.8546192,2.3591694,"I stayed here for a few nights and loved it. It's in a beautiful old building in a great spot in the Marais. I found the place super clean, it had a good vibe and friendly staff. There are no lockers in the room which would be the only suggested improvement, but they have lockers for your valuables in the luggage storage room near reception. The room I stayed in had power outlets near the beds. The USB charger didn't work, but the normal outlet did, so no issues there. Would stay again! Location is perfect, great restaurants nearby, very local and walking distance to many sights

The room was good, clean. Had a shower inside.

The points to improve
1 Breakfast was horrible. I understand that breakfast isnt very present in the french culture, so I was okay with just bread and jam. But what I was not okay was with the food being covered in flies, nothing to stop them from lying on top of the cake and bread. There were also no plates. That was really disgusting. I didnt even attend breakfast for the remaining of my stay.
2The staff werent very keen on helping Don't stay here. I booked this in a pinch because of high reviews and everything sucked. Weird mix of high school students, and people with babies. None of the plugs next to the beds worked, breakfast was an excuse for them to charge more and you get rock solid baguette and water coffee. Also a woman controlling the orange juice and coffee so you don't take too much. NO LOCKERS TO LOCK YOUR THINGS IN THE BEDROOM. And ants in the main foyer where you eat breakfast. Would not recommend. Poor room, Poor shower, Poor staff
It was like a bunker not a room.
A BED was just located in front of the alley that everybody can see with NO DOOR.
Not even a SINGLE WINDOW cannot be opened in this room, which makes the air so bad and way too hot.

Not even has a storage for luggage.
WIFI NOT WORKING IN YOUR ROOM.

A girl at checkin center were rude, didnt give any information.

Each room needs to climb a narrow stairs.

Im sorry but nothing else was satisfied except the location. I live this hostel. Great location. Staff excellent.  Rooms clean. Breakfast great. Beds comfy. Love it","Monday: 7:00 AM – 1:00 AM

Stayed here for 4 nights.
Loved how central it was to point Marie or Saint Paul station.
The reception people were nice.

However there was no towels, no hair dryer, the heating system didnt work and the USB port didnt work. Bring portable charger or an extension cord for multiple outlets.
Breakfast was nothing sustainable.
The bathroom had mould.
Had to wait for showers and bathrooms.
Downstairs shower had no door  That's like the worst customer service. The nightguard is very aggressive and threatened me and my other classmate call the police etc. and accused us of going down while we weren't even going downstairs. The rooms are dusty and you'd have to be really thin to get into the shower. The toilets near the rooms are way to small that it's difficult to open the door and the rooms don't even have a bathroom making all of us share one bathroom. The breakfast was the same everyday and wasn't even that good. The only good thing about it is that it isn't that far away from the notre dame or other sights. The bedsheets weren't even fit and the cleaning lady didn't even bother to properly clean. Could've been better... OH! AND THE WIFI DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER WORKING Overall a pretty good experience. Biggest downside was that there are barely any working outlets in the rooms, so please please bring a portable charger or somehow be willing to come in the middle of the day to charge your devices when no one else is there.

other than the outlet problem, the hostel was great! Friendly service, beautiful space, convenient location 10 min walk from norte dame, overall beautiful neighborhood. lockers were free and worked really well, very secure. remember to bring your own towel! I had a very unpleasant experience at Mije Marais Fauconnier. I originally booked a different hostel, but I was relocated here. Upon arrival, I had to wait 5 hours for checkin despite being told early checkin was possible. When I returned, the reception staff was extremely rude, making racist remarks and implying I didnt understand English. The room layout was cramped, with clustered beds and no working USB ports or adequate outlets. I requested a bed change due to claustrophobia and was rudely told I shouldve booked a hotel. WiFi is only available in the lobby, not in the rooms. Overall, I felt disrespected and uncomfortable during my stay. Rooms are very basic!!! Pleas be aware this is a youth hostel, so it could be very noisy in the morning. They have strict rules. The receptionist was not willing to acomodate my request and he said he cannot change my bed even though not all the beds were taken. Breakfast is ridiculous, bread, butter, jam, cereals and milk. Expensive for what it offers. Location is great!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 1:00 AM

The hostel felt safe and staff members were very friendly. The rooms were generally clean, but I had to share the bathroom with another room which... didn't get cleaned throughout my stay and was gross. I also didn't realize the toilet would be a completely different room out in the hallway, which was a bit uncomfortable. It was lovely to have the two people room by myself during my stay though. Unsure why I couldn't book a twobed room with a private bathroom, however, since the hostel overall looked empty. If you book through their website, they provide a free breakfast. It is minimal, but it's a great way to save money! This place is perfect! Good price, nice people, beautiful space and clean rooms.

I was even able to store my luggage both before and after my stay startedwas over.

I will definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful place to stay in the middle of the most famous street in Paris!  You are close to soo many famous attractions, but still its so quiet and nice here.

Only unlucky thing was that a couple of spiders visited my room in the evening one night.  but then there was a nice receptionist helping me to remove it amazing! Great location, very safe place, helpful and friendly stuff, clean rooms. Maybe slightly old bedsheets, but wasn't a big deal. There is an additional membership fee for 1 year. And free breakfasts if you book through their site.
If Paris again, I would return for sure. Merci beaucoup. We stayed several nights during 2024 olympics and we were satisfied! The location is perfect, at a walking distance to Champs Elysees. The rooms are newly renovated, the furniture and bathroom are very modern. In our room, only problem was that the bed was making noise. For the breakfast, it was offered croissant, coffee, juice and some jam. There is an equipped kitchen for use. It has a fantastic back garden to spend calm time and a lobby to watch TV, play games, read or play the piano. It also has a chapel in floor 1. I would definitely recommend. I came to paris twice and stayed here in both times. I really like this hostel. It is clean and quiet.
You can walk anywhere from here. My only issue is you cant be in the rooms from 10 am to 3 pm cause they are cleaning.
I would recommend to my friends and stay here again if I am ever in the city.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Rooms were really large for a hostel. The bunk beds were all on one side so it felt nice and private. Sheets were clean but the bottom sheet is laid on top not tucked in.. Beds and pillows were comfy. Can get a towel for a 10 euro deposit. Service was friendly. The shower and toilet are inside the room which is handy, but the bathroom is separate from the toilet which was odd since you couldn't wash your hands after the toilet if someone was showering. Otherwise, I had a great comfortable stay! Enjoyed my stay here. Honestly felt more like a hotel than a hostel, but really appreciated the cleanliness, happy hour offering, and most of the staff was pretty kind. Not the best for socializing, but encountered some friendly people for sure. Only drawback would be that this is quite far from the core of the city, but the view from the balcony was lovely. Doable with public transport though. Great place and service! The beds are very comfortable and spacious in comparison to other hostels, they have a light and a personal locker besides the one for your backpacks and suitcases. My favorite ammenities were the kitchen and common spaces, they had a lot of seats and connections to do coworking, also, the bedrooms have a rack to hang your clothes! The bar was cheap, specially during happy hour and I met some great people there. The biggest downside is that there is no laundry but I did mine in the bedroom sink and they have a towel dryer in each bathroom that I used to hang and dry my clothes. A great stay overall. The location is perfect because you have two metro stations very close and a couple supermarkets and stores in the street. Also, sometimes the street is used for produce markets and events. My first time staying in a hostel and it was good. I had the best roommate for the night. The room was clean and bed was freshly laid. I was so tired and didn't get to interact with people, but the bar area was lively at night. People played games, sat down for drinks and it was really nice. I'd stay here again when I solo travel It's in a nice area that is not too busy, near the metro so getting into the centre of Paris is easy.

She helped me out a lot and really improved my experience! good location right next to train station, its true that the downstairs bar can be a bit loud buts its not too bad to be honest! good experience for the price would stay again As far as hostels go a lot depends on your roommates for the night. It's a huge operation with many rooms on many floors there's always people at the reception speaking multiple languages and are pretty helpful

It can get really hot in the summer though there's no airconditioning.

If you're 2 people try to get the private rooms they are pretty comfortable for the price.

It's conveniently located next to the main train stations and there's plenty to do within walking distance too. I felt safe myself despite it having all the trappings of a European train station hood. The only criminals I saw were people selling cigarettes  who were constantly harassed by the patrolling police. Nice place to stay and discover Paris. Very well located. Near two train stations, shops, restaurants... and quite central in paris. The rooms are clean and roomy
I didn't like the smell of cigarette coming from the bar but otherwise enjoyed my stay I got amazing room with beautiful street view. The bathroom was very clean and I liked the look of it. Very comfortable mattress!! Very good location, the hotel is located next to the station from which you can get everywhere in Paris. Greetings to the reception who checked me in very quickly. Thanks for making my time with my friends in Paris very successful I had a very bad experience. I stayed there for 3 nights. On the very 1st day i went out to roam in paris. In the evening when i came back my locker was broken. My stuff was out from my luggage. This hostel is not safe. If you're taking your valuable then don't trust on the hostel room lockers.","Monday: Open 24 hours

3 Ducks Boutique Hostel & Bar,"6 Pl. Etienne Pernet, 75015 Paris, France",4.0,48.84360540000001,2.2923351,"not one of my best hostel experiences.

the bar is quite expensive and pretty dead too.

i saw a rat scurrying around while going to the room.

they dont provide shower gel or towels to dry your hands in the bathroom annoying to have to use my shower towel to dry my hands too.

the room was great. right next to a church with really loud bells that are only mildly annoying, not a big issue at all.

not bad but not great either We stayed at the 3 Ducks hostel for 3 nights, and it was lovely. The staff was friendly, welcoming and accommodating. The room was clean, the AC worked well and the bed was comfortable albeit very squeaky, it was hard to keep quiet for our bunkmates. The neighborhood has a nice cafe Good News Coffee, a couple of grocery stores and some shops, and it was a 30 second walk to the Metro. We highly recommend 3 Ducks if you're looking for an affordable place to stay in expensive Paris! The room is so incredibly tiny for 6 grown adults. Not impressed at all. Im sure you can find a better hostels around Paris for a better price. This was so bloody expensive too for what it was. A really nice surprise 
The room had its own bathroom, which is perfect, and it was super clean also. The beds were comfortable and the staff very helpful and friendly!
I loved the location, so many restaurants in the area, close to the Eiffel tower, the river, cool atmophere and nice vibe.
Biking parking right infront of the door, lime shared bikes available My friends and I really enjoyed our experience at 3 Ducks. The service was very friendly and helpful and we felt wellaccommodated.

Very close to the metro which was handy, but a further walk from the Eiffel Tower that was made out on online.

It was a bit noisy with the church bells and the bar inside the hostel, but overall we had a very nice experience.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Hostel eiffel,"75 Rue de Javel, 75015 Paris, France",4.1,48.84470630000001,2.2842668,"Room was nice enough for the price and the shared toilet and shower facilities were quite good, but only cold water came from showers which was ok since my stay was during a heatwave. Group of men down below outside room talking loudly until 4am, and some lady crying hysterically for hours and yelling all night, had to resort to earplugs and even then it was very loud due to the acoustics of where the rooms are, as the room was insanely hot the window had to be open. 5 breakfast was cereal and a baguette with coffee or juice, but I guess it fills you up and you can take some for later. Small rooms with bed, table and sink. Outlets above bed have USB power connection but no shelf or headboard to place a device on. One standard European 220v on side wall near table. Single shower room located on each floor, toilet located next to stairs, inbetween floors. WiFi worked very well with strong signal and smooth connection.Bed was comfortable. Breakfast was okay, mostly bread. Short walk from metro station. It reminded me of the little cafe at the beginning of the movie Ronin. You enter via the barcafe. I found that I enjoyed walking out into the local streets and immediately being immersed in Paris.
Jeffry and Nasir are very warm kind hosts. Rooms were clean comfortable as were toilets and showers. Great location, rooms are cozy, and the staff is very nice. If you happen to arrive during their afternoon break, just knock someone will come to the door. A brilliant location, very friendly staff, large rooms a bit modest though, comfortable beds, relatively low prices and overally affordable. Only the Wifi could be a bit more efficient.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Peace and Love Hostel - Hostel Paris,"245 Rue La Fayette, 75010 Paris, France",3.2,48.88260769999999,2.369183999999999,"The front staff are so amazing.  Chanaka went well beyond his duties helping us get a ride to the airport.  Always smiling and ready to help.  We also appreciated how quickly front staff responded to our needs.  Thank you thank you.  We were warned about the stairs and I guess with our senior age we found ourselves out of breath.  Just make sure you have  everything you  need before leaving the room for the descent Me and my girlfriend got bedbug bitten all over our bodies in one of their private rooms, and when we showed photos of the confirmed bites to the staff, they agreed that it was bedbugs and said they would ""check the room"" but offered no compensation or reduction in price. Apart from that, at 5am during one of the nights someone tried to get into our room, saying they had forgotten something, which they couldn't have since we'd been there for three nights already and would have seen their things. The person was banging constantly for about 15 minutes, which felt pretty sketchy. So in summary Peace and Love Hostel obviously have no control of who goes inside, and a severe bedbug problem, but at least Canal Saint Martin isn't the worst location. I've been traveling in Europe for a month and have stayed in a number of hostels of varying two star ratings. I've never been met with such hostility, however. The name ""Peace and Love"" is ironic and the opposite of the experience I had during my 6 night stay here. Every morning and afternoon the ""manager"" was yelling, the main area was constantly inundated with angry guests. He accused me of leaving a mess in the kitchen with no evidence. The manager who refused to give me his name was loathe to help me, acting exasperated when I asked for water, wifi etc.

One morning while I was there, I had an accident in the kitchen. The cleaning staff had failed to notice a bowl full of cooking oil perched on a shelf alongside the clean dishes. When I reached for it, the oil spilled all over my clothing and ruined my skirt and sweater. I complained and asked them to reimburse me for the dry cleaning fees 26.50eur. They declined and gaslit me, Maya asked me if I was ""serious"" about my complaint and said that I should ""think before I speak"". She said that I must think that I'm ""in a movie"" and that she had no responsibility for the wellbeing of the guests. The daytime manager said that I should take it up with the person who left the bowl of oil. I asked to speak to the owner several times, none employees were able to give me an accurate time to meet him. They also refused to provide contact information and pointed fingers. The manager told me that it was my fault, that I spilled the bowl of oil on myself and that I would not be getting reimbursed for my expenses. When I asked why, he said because I would not be getting a reimbursement. The owner of the hostel lied to me when I asked if he was the owner, telling me he was merely an employee there and couldnt help.

The wifi barely works in the hostel rooms and slowly in the main area which is, at all hours, blasting music. They enabled binge drinking and one of the guests in the room next to mine threw up all over the communal bathroom at 9pm after doing shots at the hostel bar. He was belligerent and tried to solicit me.

The staff lied to me, gaslit me, called me names and bullied me into leaving. They refused to take responsibility. I couldnt have had a worse experience, my trip was ruined. Needed to a book a room the day of, wasnt expecting much, but the staff was absolutely fantastic. Clean place. Staff was very helpful and friendly. I can easily say they went above and beyond. Nice quiet place, very affordable. With kitchen and a bar downstairs with everything you need. I had a 3 bed room, a nice change from the hostel rooms which have 6 or more beds.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The People Paris Nation,"28 Bis Pl. de la Nation, 75012 Paris, France",4.1,48.8477131,2.3973172,"One of the best hostels Ive stayed at in Europe! Super comfortable bed, had everything youd need in a room if youre there for a short stay. Super helpful and friendly people working at the concierge  always up for a chat! Im a solo female traveller and I felt so safe in the area. Its located right next to a supermarket, public transport and restaurants as well are close by if you dont want to go into town. Rooftop bar has a nice view of Paris. Bathrooms could be cleaned a bit more regularly, but it didnt put me off as they were mostly fine. Highly recommend! The hotel is located closed to the subway station,very convenient. There are many supermarkets and restaurants nearby,also.

The reception staff is very helpful, and her English is excellent.

The room is very clean, and the bed is comfortable. The shower room and toilet are a bit narrow, but they are also clean. But bathrooms gets dirty after many people use it in the midnight,water and hairs on the floor. So remember to bring slippers. Of course, like other hostels, here also do not provide any toiletries, towels or locks, remember to bring them as well.

And there is no public space except bar.The bar
is on the sixth floor, and the reception would tell you can eat your own food there, but in fact, if you don't order something, you'll be politely reminded. Also, there is no laundry room, but there is a public laundromat nearby. This is my second time staying here and there will be a third!
The good  the hostel is INCREDIBLY close to the metro from which you can get practically anywhere. There are also bus stops, considering it is a very big Piazza in Paris. The place seems generally clean, private, the beds are all you need, and the people who work there are incredibly nice. I loved going up and working on my laptop on the 6th floor, and the view from almost every room is imppecable. Everything looks so new!

The bad  I stayed with some nasty people in my room who didn't know how to keep themselves organized... Oh well, not the hostel's fault, I guess. The room for 8 people is very crowded, and even though I didn't have an issue, I can imagine how there will simply be not enough space if two or more people wanted to open their suitcases at the same time. Lastly, no kitchen or even fridge is a shame since a breakfast that isn't a croissant and a cigarette is never very cheap.

Thank you to all the staff! I stayed here for 3 nights, and the location near the National Monument was excellent. The bed and pillow were very comfortable, which made the stay enjoyable.

However, I had an unfortunate experience. I left my souvenirs in the locker room as I hurried to check out. When I returned, the souvenirs were gone. There were four of us checking out at the same time, and I understand that the room would need to be cleared before new guests arrived. While I cannot be certain, I suspect that the cleaning staff may have taken my items. Of course, this is just an assumption, but its disappointing nonetheless. We stayed 3 nights. The place is located next to the subway, very convenient. However the bathroom was never clean, the floor always wet and smelly. The room was ok with a lamp and two power outlets, the street is quite busy and you might hear cars, people, machines from the windows. Theres no working areas, there is a barrestaurant that plays music all the time.",no operation time,"bar, lodging, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment"
FIAP Jean Monnet,"30 Rue Cabanis, 75014 Paris, France",4.0,48.83046580000001,2.3380702,"The best hotel and company experience I had was at FIAP. At the reception, they gave me the best help and attention. Laura was excellent and offered great service, solving some questions I had. Honestly, I felt super comfortable with her, and the attention she gave me, and it feels good to be welcomed as a customer. I would definitely come back again. Great place for a group on a school trip. Very good location close to metro  RER. Decent amount of choice of food for breakfast and evening meal, and big portions, which is good when you are out sightseeing  walking around Paris all day. Rooms clean and practical. Staff very helpful. Will definitely use for future trips. Second time staying here with my mom and dad. Great place, amazing breakfast. Laura at the reception was lovely and helpful. Definitely my go to hotel when I come to Paris I stayed here along with 50 others for 4 days for a trip and hated every bit. Firstly, the food was absolutely disgusting, it was handed to us raw. Had to take extra things at breakfast to full me up because I couldnt eat the dinner. Tried to go to sleep one night but got woken up by horrible screaming from , what it sounded like, outside the hotel. Then we hear running up and down corridors and banging on doors at 1 in the morning. Turns out to be a drunk worker. Found bedbugs in the bed, some dead but a couple crawling around. Bathroom came with no hand soap or sanitiser.

Would never recommend, not coming back. I went here on a school trip and it was really great! The rooms were very clean and comfortable and a good space for a group of 5. The staff were all very helpful and there was a games room which many in my school enjoyed. It's also close to a metro and in a good area. Would definitely recommend to other large groups.","Monday: Open 24 hours

BVJ Louvre - Hostel,"20 Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 75001 Paris, France",3.0,48.8625819,2.341216799999999,"Well it may have taken me 38 years to write a review on this place but better late than never.
It was called the Auberge de Jeunesse in December of 1985. I met some of the most amazing people at this place. There was a boulangerie across the road now gone where we bought bread and cheese and wine. Rules were soft back then so a group of 8 or so of us newly formed friends had a great time.
The place was okay but what do you expect for such a low price per might and access to everything nearby. Im amazed to learn it's still operating but it was really busy back then so guess not so surprised. I was 22 back then. Now 60. Make the most of your life, stay at places like this which you can't always find.. without complaining. Staying in this hostel was a horrific experience. The dirtiest place I've ever been in my life, unsafe and disgusting. We couldn't close the windows or leave the door open because of the terrible smell that came from the toilets, one of that was completelly full of trash and human waste. Beds were full of bed bugs, I got hundreds of bites. Cleaning ladies didn't actually clean at all! I've informed the staff more than once, about everything I'm reporting here, and they were unfirendly and rude. I was having a severe allergic reaction never been allergic to anything before beacuse of the bed bugs bites and they didn't help in any way, the consequences of which led to weeks of medication and cortisone shots, numerous hospital checks and a permanent allergy to NSAID. Good hostel with an excellent location! Rooms were decent and spacious, facilities are basic  push shower, no lockers, and scare number of power outlets in the room. Had to charge my devices in the common area which is lovely!. Breakfast was included and they offered an open room where you could leave luggage. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Overall, the location, value and friendly staff make this a great choice for a stay in Paris. This is one of the best hostels I stayed at in Europe. Sure it is not fancy but that is clearly stated on the listing and the email confirmation. There is no elevator but that was fine with me. I thought it was a great value for the money. It's a very charming old building and the room I stayed in was very cozy. Clean sheets and towels as you need them and the breakfast was excellent! I have not had a better breakfast in any of the hostels I stayed in across Europe. The location is great too! You're in a youth hostel. They make that clear in their description. It's not fancy, but the people are very friendly and helpful. I stayed in a two person room and no one else booked the other bed the 3 nights I was there. The free breakfast was basic, yet abundant. So close to most major attractions and to several metro stations. Clean, mostly quiet though I went in the offseason and a perfect place to lay your head for the night. I'll be back! Do not bring anything very valuable  there are only a few lockers that work. Most were out of order. Be prepared to carry it with you if you don't want to leave it in the room or dorm.","Monday: Open 24 hours

HI Hostel Paris Yves Robert,"20 Espl. Nathalie Sarraute, 75018 Paris, France",3.9,48.8886194,2.3629243,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. First of all, we noticed the terrible condition of the room and the public toilets. In the shower, it smelled like feaces, and it was impossible to adjust the temperature. The numerous public toilets on the floor were dirty with feaces and urine, there was no soap, and a cockroach was found in the bin. On the first day, karaoke and music were played in the lobby until 015, which seems to be a regular occurrence here, because the next day there was also a music event in the lobby until late at night  so earplugs should definitely be brought along. However, the worst part was that the ventilation in the room couldnt be turned off, resulting in constant noise, and the blower was aimed directly at our heads all night! In the morning, we woke up with puffy eyes and stuffy noses. The reception couldnt help with this issue. In general, it can be said that the service was at least basic, with the advantage of a 24hour reception, and they did refill the soap after our complaint.

Unfortunately, the breakfast was also a disappointment. The fruit was mostly overripe, and each guest was limited to two small bread rolls. Overall, it was a big disappointment. Very nice place with exceptionally kind staff. The room is very clean as well as the toilet which are outside the room. The breakfast which is included is substantial and tasty. The prices at the bar are more than reasonable compared to the rest of city. The WiFi is a bit boring to set up you have to login every time you connect but it works fine if you want to watch shows or videos. The place were pretty quiet when we were there but I guess it can vary throughout the year. The neighborhood is friendly and you have a metro station a few minutes away from the youth hostel.
I can only recommend I absolutely loved this hostel. The place was super clean, the room was very quiet and nice, the toilet which are not in the room are always clean, the shower inside the room was also clean and nice. Absolutely loved the quiet and temperature of the room. Breakfast was super nice and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. I totally think im gonna come back if its for 2 nights!!
I would love a toilet inside the room tho. The whole place is grimy and dirty. The shower rooms are rusty, water damaged, and each time I showered the walls were covered in hair. The bathrooms were shared with over 4 rooms and smell very bad. If a hostel is going to have only shared toilet and shower they need to do much better at cleaning them often.

My bed frame was dusty and grimy, I sanitized it when I arrived because it looked awful. Clearly that doesnt happen between guests, I dont even want to imagine what other corners the cleaning staff and owners take to reduce costs.

There were very large groups 30 people staying during my entire stay, which made things quite loud. The rooms are supposed to be quiet zones, but there was always noise from outside. No fans or air circulating in the room unless we had windows open. Windows open let in many bugs and even more noise.

They advertise free wifi, but even on the 1 floor, I could not access it from my room. Area isn't the absolute most convenient but there are some bars and restaurants. Seems to be in an African neighborhood with a lot of locals at the bar. Breakfast is the best I've ever had at a hostel. Workers and staff were great. Clean accommodations.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Only thing I could suggest would be if the rooms had a fan as the afternoon was quite warm but we left our window open and still slept well! Great breakfast and really like the 11am check out. No air conditioning. My friends and I had no sleep due to a stuffy hot room. I approached the reception kindly. The elderly man was extremely judgmental and dismissive. A truly horrible experience. Kindness is free, and would go along way in this hotel. I had a lovely stay, thank you! Great value for money. Amazing neighbourhood, comfy bed, quiet, safe, nicely decorated and super friendly and helpful staff. Fab thing petit dejeuner  and views from the room. Least fab thing the bathroom smelled a bit like sewage but no big deal. Merci Beaucoup!  Great hotel! I would definitely recommend it. Safe, clean, centrical, and beautiful. I had a very nice time, and slept very well. Thank you so much! I will comeback for sure next time I go to Paris, and I'll bring my friends with me  Receptionist was really friendly and helpful.

Aloha Hostel,"1 Rue Borromée, 75015 Paris, France",3.2,48.84217830000001,2.304601900000001,"My room was nothing like the picture. Four rickety beds and barely walking space. I was on the top bunk, my ladder was missing a screw. There was mystery stains on the walls and the door. The pillow felt like a ziploc bag of air and the door and window squeaked.

The shower was absolutely DISGUSTING. It was a raised room, the whole floor shared one shower. The shower curtain did not work and the shower flooded the floor, and dripped out into the hallway. There was no space, I had to put my towel in the sink to keep it from getting wet. There was no shower head, just a pipe sticking out of the wall and there was mold in the shower. Honestly felt unclean after showering.

I would not recommend this hostel We had a private room with two beds while sharing a communal bathroom. This hostel is so good for a great price! It was a metro ride away from the inner zones and was easily accessible by buses as well. I recommend staying here. I don't know how the shared rooms are, but make sure to bring earbuds. The communal bathrooms were clean enough, but bring shower shoes. The toilets were well stocked with toilet paper and soap. The breakfast was included with a croissant and Baguette with cereal. I recommend saving the bread for lunch if you're on a budget If you walk down the Rue Borrome, you can even view some of the Eiffel tower! It is a safe area surrounded by good restaurants, grocery stores, and some good laundry mats. Enjoy your time in Paris!! Hostel was in a good location, not too touristy and near the Eiffel Tower. Walking distance from a metro station. Breakfast was average, with not much choice. We stayed in a four bed dorm, which was  clean but did not have air con! Staff were friendly, but hostel seemed quite dated and in need of a refurb. Also very quiet, with no events. WOW! My first day,. I was lucky to meet another nice guest for a drink and as we sat down at the bar on the corner, without realizing , we said cheers in with a direct view to the EiFFEL TOWER . It was beautiful . If you are there, go this little bar The receptionist Vinicios was SUPER friendly and gave us the best advice where to go.  For me it was perfect Just for the room, I would have loved to have a way to charge my phone on my bed. that's all. Even if you don't have a locker, many comments, say it is a problem  But it is NOT true. The reception is offering to leave your stuff , if the locker is not enough, you can keep the rest in a storage room. The hostel is alright. It's nothing wow. They could improve the beds and pillows. They were terrible. The showers were okay, but clean. So was the toilet. It's cheap and in a good location, about a 10minute walk from the metro. The surrounding area has parking, small shops, restaurants, cafes...if you're going to stay for a few nights, it's okay. But don't expect too much. Also, they don't have any lockers or safe storage in the room, which is not great. They have a small locker near the reception, but it's not adequate. hostellife travel budgettravel ",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The family that runs the place is very welcoming, accommodating, and helpful. I was a bit nervous about breakfast at first but it ended up being enough protein to get me started for the day. They make eggs to order and provide a great spread of meats as well as traditional French pastries like croissants, which were amazing.

The location was a big win for us. 10 min walk to the Eiffel Tower, 10 mins walk to the subway line, and good restaurants close by. The room worked out well for our family 2 adults, 2 kids. Separate rooms with a bathroom in between them made it feel spacious enough. Old building so the floors are creaky and the door uses a traditional lock and key that I needed to pack around, but that didnt bother me considering all the upsides. Everything was clean. Amazing place and service is top notch. We stayed there for 2 nights and really enjoyed it. The owner called me to confirm what time we were arriving in Paris and even shared some tips with me for travelling within the city. The breakfast was really good and location is within walking distance to Eiffel Tower. We stayed at the Relais 12bis Bed and Breakfast for 4 days at the end of the summer holidays, and it was an absolutely wonderful experience.

Phillipe was an enthusiastic and attentive host. Nothing was too much to ask.

The rooms were spotless and exceptionally cosy. The breakfasts were delicious and set us up for the day, we barely needed lunch.

Our 2 young children loved the fact we could walk to the Eiffel tower and pop out to see the twinkling lights at 9pm in pyjamas.

We would highly recommend the Relais 12bis Bed and Breakfast to anyone visiting Paris. It is a great place to stay for families, and it is perfectly located for exploring the city. It was simply magnificent. I really liked the breakfast. It was very filling and delicious. The rooms were very clean. I loved the decoration. The hosts were very welcoming and friendly. They support you in every matter. If I visit Paris again, I would definitely choose this place. Thank you very much to Mr. Philipe and Mr. Leo for their kindness and help. It was an unforgettable experience for me. My husband and I enjoyed our recent extraordinary three night stay in our beautifully appointed room.  The room was clean, the bed comfortable and the bathroom large with essential amenities.  A delicious homemade breakfast awaited us each morning.
