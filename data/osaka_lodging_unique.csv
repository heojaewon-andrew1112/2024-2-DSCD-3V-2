The OneFive Osaka Namba Dotonbori,"2-13 Souemonchō, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0084, Japan",3.5,34.669702,135.5049396,"Located deep in the heart of the crazy Dotonbori district with a very short walk to the famous sign and bridge. That ends the positive portion of the review.

The entire hotel smells like 50 years of cigarette smoke, even though it is a nonsmoking hotel. The rooms are Motel 6 quality with no amenities or services of any kind. No ice, no water and the staff is borderline hostile. Bed was extremely uncomfortable, 2 total pillows provided, and the AC made lots of strange noises. The bathroom was like they put a bathroom from a train in it with a nice little 4 inch step over that you will stub your tow on during your uncomfortable stay.

Worst part, no secure luggage storage. If you check out or arrive early and want to store your bags they leave them in an unlocked room int the lobby, fully visible to anyone that happens in the hotel.

Only stay at this hotel if you plan on getting totally drunk at the local bars and pass out without having to walk far. Whoever read my review about this Hotel.
You should never book this hotel.

1. Full of Pee smell in whole room.
 Room, Bed, Toilet, Closet, everything.
 If you sleep in this room, your body and hair will be the same.

2. Extremely small room.
 there is no spaces for open baggages.

3. You can sleep with big noisy.. windows are not soundproof.

4. Prostitution shops are so near by, and working people nearby too.

Only the thing that i can recommand you is the cheap price. Restaurant was closed. You can only sit in the hotel room, so low comfort. Small room. But, its located near 711, near the heart on Dotonbori, and we managed to book 3 rooms for 6 family members 2 went in each room. Good availability. Worst hotel experience . First impression of the room smelled like a bar. Foul smells of cigarettes and other unidentified odors hit you in the face like a pile of bricks. Also, AC did not work at all so the shoebox room was literally a 98 degree oven. The front desk person came in the room and sprayed air freshener and left. I finally became fed up and asked for an exchange after enduring 5 minutes of pain and was greeted by a cheeky manager who laughed indicating that the room was already used, literally after 10 mins of walking into the room. Overall, 1 out 10 across the board. Only thing this hotel had was location, but full of employees who do not care. Asked for refund, and guess what they refused. The 20 year old manager thought everything was hilarious, kept laughing throughout the entire process. Super insulting... I dont know why there are so many bad reviews. The room is small but thats most Japan hotel rooms apart from that there really wasnt anything to complain about. Its in the absolute heart of the entertainment district, easy to walk everywhere, 10min or so walk from Namba station, it was pretty loud on the street but the sound proofing was good, easy check in and out, amenities available in the lobby toothbrushespaste, hair brushes, hair ties, slippers, robes, cotton buds, body sponges, cotton rounds, probably other things Im forgetting, comfy enough bed. No tea, coffee or water bottles provided in the rooms but I always see that as an extra bonus anyway. Very clean and nice!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

It has easy access to the Osaka metro, so you're never more than 20 minutes from some amazing part of Osaka. The hotel itself looks good, with a clean and spacious lobby. The staff are very helpful as well. I only gave 4 stars for Service because the laundry machines are awful  the rest is great. We liked the location of the hotel, the bathroom, amenities and the support we received from the front desk. Special appreciation to Izuwan I think I'm spelling his name correctly for swiftly fixing the issues we had with our toilet. Honestly, the double room is ideal only for two people with a maximum of two suitcases and two bags. The hotel shouldn't be accepting family with kids in this room type. There's no space to walk around when you need that child bed and have three or four pieces of luggage.  Additionally, the aircon inlet and room exhaust on the ceiling near the entrance were dusty. Centrally located in Osaka, close to several Metro Stations and tourist locations. Hotel is very clean, comfortable. Great service. Breakfast buffet is really good as well. Will stay again in a future visit to Osaka. stayed here for 3 nights. During check in, there were a few miscalculations in the front desk. It took roughly 30 minutes to recalculate. We checked in at 3 they start checking guests in at 3 and got into our rooms at 330 ish.

Upon check in, we got to pick our own complimentary beverages, 1 for each guest staying. I only got water bcs i didnt wanna get dehydrated from the summer heat. Beside the fridge, exists the amenities bar, where we can get any amenities at any quantity.

breakfast was DELICIOUS. i ended up refilling 3x!!  breakfast truly exceeded my expectations!!

Room was okay, average size for japan If you're looking for a budget friendly hotel that provides all the basic needs, this is one of the perfect options for you. Don't hesitate if you have more expensive options. Details are below or above, I wrote some more before this main one.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The area seems kinda rough, and we got a lot of stares whenever we were in the area. Otherwise, pretty decent place to stay for cheap in Osaka, given that you're more focused on being anywhere but the hotel. We arrived late so we did the selfcheck in and it was very smooth we just informed them in advance and theyve sent us instructions through email. The neighborhood is PEACEFUL and just a 5min walk from DobutsuenMae Station Exit 9. We stayed on the 6th floor in which you will be taking a flight of stairs after the lift but our room is dainty and it is spacious enough to fit our 4 luggages. Although the toilet is sharing, the room has shower and its clean with shampoo, body soap and conditioner provided. And like what Ive read from other reviews, the wall is really thin and you can hear the other room talking but it was quiet at night. Overall, we enjoyed our 3 nights stay in the hotel and we got it for a good price as they offered discount for 3 or more nights stay. Location  quiet area with lot of seniors drunk homeless?? 58mins near Dobutsuen Mae station and Shin imamiya station.

You can also walk going to Tsukenkaku Tower, it will take you 15 mins to go there.

Rooms  Its good for its price. The sheets are clean. As for the space, you will have a hard time opening your luggages, the room is best for backpackers. N they don't provide coffee but they do provide washing machine, dryer will be 100yen... The man toilet on level 4 is  totally disgusting, they really need a mega renovation on it....

Take note as that the staffs will not be there all the time but they are friendly

The rooms are not sound proof, there 1 night with some Japanese students chatting n laughing loudly away in the middle of the night till early morning n U could hear it ..

Personally with the price paid, I would recommend other guest houses like the Sunplaza nearby which charge almost the same price n much comfortable there Very affordable and near DobutsuenMae Station wherein from which you can basically go to any place you like using the metro.  The rooms are surprisingly spacious for the price you pay and its very convenient to check in and check out. Like what other reviewers said, this place is a dormitory not a hotel! I stayed overnight and just could not sleep the whole evening.

No toilets in each rooms. If you need to pee or have menstruation you have to go out of your room, walk the stairs, which is not safe for girls and the elderly.
They only have darkold towels. Even the cheapest inns in Japan have pajamas and clean towels.
Thin walls allowing for constant noise, especially in the communal living room where people talk overnight. You can hear your neighbors cough and swallow their saliva  Not joking 
No staff at night, and the location is dangerous and dirty.

Overall, disappointing place to stay in Osaka. Dont expect improvements despite managements promises.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Convenient location and direct train 970 from Osaka Airport to the hotel located at station .  Station has elevator and is just opposite to the hotel by 3min on foot.  JR Station is the nearest to the hotel, and Metro Line is not far, around 10min walking distance.  Though the room is facing to the railway, but the window shield is good, merely heard the noise in night time or early morning. Hotel provides free coffee from 12002400 on 2F restaurant, taste is unexpectedly good.  We have stayed in this hotel second time, for sure, will choose this hotel every time when we travel to Osaka. Generally satisfied as it is located near to the JR Nankai station where it is easily accessed to the Kansai International airline. We are being given on 11th floor room, so wasn't being affected by the noise of the train. PS It is good also to know the different side of Japan. The 2nd level of 2 bedrooms are okay . However , its always in a Noisy conditionthe train and crowded of young people. They always yell and also play till midnights or even 23 in the morning.

Besides , theres only 2 washing machines for all the guests . Every washing time at least 80 minutes including dry the clothes . Therefore you need to wait for another day when other tourists are out or even give up using it .
My plan included breakfast . The breakfast are on the average. Just checked in to this hotel for 4 nights stay. First the reception gave me 2 rooms instead of the 3 rooms I booked and paid for already through Agoda. The rooms are nothing like the pictures. The carpet is really really old. The whole room feels and looks old. Too many young guests staying here and partying in one anothers room, making the corridor really really noisy. And the lifts stop at multiple floors all the time because the youngsters keep going to one anothers rooms. You definitely can hear the train from the room, thats why they provide ear plugs in the lobby for you to use. There is no hair dryer in my room and when I went to the reception to ask for one, the reception went into the back room to take one out but he told me hell send it to my room instead of just passing it to me in the spot. So, I had to go back to my room to wait for him and cant take a shower yet. Its very near the train station but the neighbourhood feels messy with too many rowdy foreigners. Its my 7th time in Osaka and this is the worst hotel and service Id experienced. Do not stay here if you can. Hotel is unable to reply to a simple email. Being trying to get a response from them for a week after leaving an item of clothing in the room. I even wrote to them in Japanese!

The rooms are small but fine. The hotel is right next to the railway so you can hear trains from 6am until midnight. If youre a light sleeper it might interrupt you. The hotel is situated next to what looks like a dumping ground for junk some referred to it as a homeless area except I didnt see any homeless people, just piles of junk.

Breakfast is basically dinner which is fine for some I guess but not really for Europeans. Personally I dont want fried chicken and rice at 7am. The only alternative was tiny croissants and jam. The coffee might be free but its not nice at all so you wont end up drinking it.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The room was good, providing a comfortable stay. A unique aspect of this hotel is that you have to remove your shoes at the lobby and store them in a locker, which adds to the authentic experience.

The entire hotel features tatami surfaces, giving it a traditional Japanese feel. The natural water bath was a highlight, offering a relaxing and rejuvenating experience. The breakfast was Japanese and excellent, providing a delicious taste of Japan that we truly loved.

Overall, this hotel offers an authentic and enjoyable Japanese experience with its traditional touches and excellent amenities. This was an amazing place! The onsen was fantastic, and my son absolutely loved the experience. The entire atmosphere was relaxing, and it provided a perfect break from the busy city. We left feeling refreshed and grateful for the rest. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a great onsen experience in Namba. Overall, it is an outdated hotel in a good location. It is very close the train station and dotonburi. Location is the only good thing about this place.

We booked this hotel via chase travel portal. Apparently, the hotel charges extra for room cleaning which was not noted when we made the booking. Guests were expected to leave  the trash outside of their room daily, but the hotel did not provide additional trash bags.. in the morning, the hotel hallway looks like a war zone with all the garbage bags and used pajamas laying in around.

The walls are super thin and the wall paper was peeling. We were on the 10th floor and I can still hear the traffic all the time. House cleaning starts around 9am and I can hear the vacuum loud and clear in my room.

We booked a king bed. It was actually two beds put together it was very uncomfortable to sleep on it.

The socalled welcome beverage was just a coffeetea container for self serving at the lobby. The hotel breakfast was 2300yen per person but the food was kinda not so great. There are much better breakfast options nearby for the same or less cost. The service was subpar and unorganized. It did not meet my expectations for Japanese hospitality. Words cannot express how much we loved this place. This was our favorite stay in our entire month long trip in Japan.
Rooms were great and spacious
Onsen was amazing, best one we visited in Japan.
The service was great
They helped save my life when I had a peanut allergy and one of the employees stayed in the ambulance to help translate all of the needed info
We are visiting this place every time we come back to Japan 11 out of 10 best place ever Best stay in Japan for me. Great value and even better stay. Located near to kintetsu nippombashi station. Lots of food and convenient store is nearby. Bright and comfy room. Everything was good. I stayed here because of the breakfast buffet and I want to go back again. I love walking around the hotel with no shoes cause it feels like home away from home.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

WOW! I couldnt be more impressed. I could have stayed here my entire trip. The staff is friendly, everything is exceptionally clean, its incredibly private I barely even saw anyone in the bathrooms my entire stay and best of all, the beds are so spacious, efficient, and have a privacy screen. The common area is beautiful and makes you actually want to relax there. There are so many different travelers, its all an exceptional experience. Plus, the location is great. A hostelstyled place with a very big smiled and helpful staffs. We stayed in a family room which was big enough to open your luggage flat on the floor. Clean room with a little cigarette smell in the elevator. The kitchen and living area are spacious and equipped with enough kitchen ware. Its location is very close to one metro line I had a great stay here. The place was nice, with a big kitchen that made it easy to cook meals. The staff were friendly and always willing to help. The location was also perfect being just a short walk to the Tomdori River Walk and the main markets. Plus, the subway station is only a few minutes away, which made getting around the city super convenient. I definitely recommend this hostel if youre visiting Osaka! Im an experienced traveller and The Stay in Shinsaibashi is a standout travellers hotel.

Its incredibly clean, efficient, comfortable and wellrun. The hotel offers customers nice touches such as a free umbrellas to borrow for rainy days, excellent shower products. Security is also strong.

The location is great, price very competitive and atmosphere among guests quiet and respectful. They had a nice kitchen you could use. The staff was really friendly and we could do takoyaki for free on an event. In the dorm it was very quiet and all the guests were respectful",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The area where the hotel was located is pretty old, and the street near the hotel are full of garbage and homeless people. Those are not even the biggest problem. One day morning when my group is walking to the subway station, there was a man who show middle finger to us I cant just ignore it so I show it back. But honestly after I did it, I was a bit worried about the man will start a fight, but thankfully he didnt have the courageous to do so. However this is definitely not welcoming and made me feel  unsafe. By the way we are traveling in a group of three and are all female, which made us feel even more uncomfortable with the location

The hotel room is a bit tiny, we dont really have place to open our luggage, but it wasnt a big deal. And I wish the room can be cleaner though, because there was a lot of dust on the bed board that is not covered by the mattress. Although we dont see the staff of the hotels often since they are only at the front desk for a short period of time but they are nice people and have good attitude. We booked this for a group of 4, and the value for money is the first reason why we chose this hotel. Its comfortable and of a pretty decent size. The location is also a stone's throw away from one of the train stations going to Namba, which is really convenient. Speaking of the location, I know many of you are curious about the ""safety"" issues mentioned in a lot of reviews here. Lets put things into perspective. I can understand why some people may find it looks ""unsafe"" because there are some homeless people around the area however, it always depends on what you consider unsafe. My friends and I come from a country where unsafe means you are really in danger, like crimes and those kinds of stuff, but I am telling you, this area isnt like that. We never felt unsafe, and there was no reason for us to feel that when we were there. My advice is if homeless people or just a regular residential area will make you feel uncomfortable, then dont book it. But if youre okay with staying in an area with real residential life, then give this place a chance. The hotel was fine but the noise of the trains starting at 5 am make it impossible to have a good sleep, even worst if you travel with kids. Great hotel. It is well kept, clean, modern, with spacious rooms. Service is great and staff is super friendly. You can tell the owner takes pride in their business.

Although it is in a poorer area, it is close to the Osaka morning market and subway.

The lobby is nice, with a bar, and sitting areas. There is both an inside dining area, and some caf tables in a small private courtyard. They also have convenient laundry facilities. everything was perfect! Friendly english speaking staff. Everything was clean.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM

All the major attractions were so close and easily accessible. The room was wellequipped with a big TV, big windows which I love to see the sun and a small fridge for storing food, fresh towels, and fast WiFi. The bed was incredibly comfortable, I appreciated the added convenience of USB ports and cords for easy charging and a switch for the lights beside the bed so you dont have to get up very smart and thoughtful! everything felt fresh and clean. The hotels cleanliness and organization were topnotch, and the staff were friendly and accommodating. Plus, I loved that you could use a PIN for the door instead of carrying keys. It was one of the most affordable yet comfortable stays I've had in Osaka! I seen people peeing around the area, it's honestly not a good area it looks scary and not safe for been japan plus the area looks dirty . And the room for a non smoking room it smells horrible like cigarettes.
Outside of the hotel it's dirty and they don't have a person there to help it's all I. Your phone. The CP value for this hotel is max. You get a cozy small sofa, private TV, Aircone that is working perfectly in the room. After long day of walking sometimes I just want to go to the nearby convenience store and grab something and chill in the room. Facilities are always available and clean. Full hotel is equipped with ACinclude bathroom, Tennoji and Shinsekai is about 10 minutes walking distance.

Cons Room have spider and small cockroach although it is quite clean, I killed the cockroach and leave the spider be. No big deal for me even though I'm scared of cockroach. Surrounding neighborhood is full of homeless people, sometimes the surrounding smells like piss, but in the hotel is perfectly fine.

Btw, counter is always friendly, and easy check in check out process. They can speak English! I not regret staying here. Good value for price  brand new hotel, clean room, very helpful and nice staff. Some customers are complaining about the area full of drunk men, but honestly they look harmless.

Firstly location wise, it was great and strategic, near to the train station and Dotonbori. Room was quiet and comfortable. Amenities provided were great and more than sufficient. Service was great from the start till end of stay, smooth checking in and out process. Kudos to the staff for assisting us in calling a restaurant as we needed assistance in confirming our reservation. The hotel is clean and the room is a good size for a couple traveling with two big luggages. Hotel provides everything you may forget to bring such as toothbrush, toothpaste, hair tie, lotion, makeup remover, razor, shower sponge, etc. All can be grabbed by yourself in the front lobby. Daily housekeeping is by the guest's request by simply putting the sign on the door before 12pm. Location is amazing. Metro station is right in front of the hotel. Dotonburi Street is just a short walk behind the hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Osaka, Japan. Location is awesome. So close to an arcade and affordable street food. Reasonably priced stay. Slightly confused by how breakfast works. But great if they offer it to you. Could not have asked for more.

The shower was a blast. Spacious maybe relatively. We stayed here for 4 nights.  The location is great it is in the center of everything and very close to Dotonbori. The subway and the taxi stand are just right outside.  The room is good the bathroom is separated from the shower, the shower has strong water pressure and hot water, and it has great AC. Considering the location, the room space was good for us, 2 adults and 1 toddler. They also have items free for guests, such as hair ties, razors, face washlotions, etc., and all are located in the lobby with a small fan and iron, among other things you can borrow.  You can also use a weighing scale and a money exchange machine in the lobby. The only downside for us was the breakfast. It was very disappointing. It was not advertised that you only get 4 pieces of different bread and apple juice, so we paid more than we should have for it while booking. Lawson is right next door, so if you want a quick meal, it is much cheaper to get breakfast there. So I recommend not to book breakfast ahead of time and wait until your checkin.

All in all, our stay was good. Probably depends on the room they give you but mine feels like living in a basement although it is on the sixth floor. Very dark room, window was blurred out but it doesnt matter anyhow, it only opens 10 cm and then you look at a concrete wall 1 m away from you.
Although the room is spacious for Japan, it is not very practical . No light switch near the entrance, for example.","Monday: Open 24 hours

BON Hostel,"3-chōme-1-3 Shikitsuhigashi, Naniwa Ward, Osaka, 556-0012, Japan",4.0,34.6562048,135.5018354,"Super worth it, place is great and cozy. Staffs are friendly and they do speak English. I would say not to stay in the place during day time for taking a quick nap during day time because of the subway train tracks are right above this stay, its bit annoying sometimes which is upto midnight. Rooms and bathrooms are well maintained. Atleast Drinking water can be provided. Get water bottles in convenience stores before you reach this place The toilet and bathroom are very clean. The bed is comfortable. I really appreciate that they let me have lower bed. I was shock when I knew that it's located right under the railway, so you can feel the sound and vibration each time a train passing by. But I have a very nice sleep regardless. The male receptionists are also nice and helpful.

However, I don't appreciate one of the female receptionists because I came at 2 PM coz in the email I received its the check in time. I push the bell many times and no one came. After a few minutes, came a lady with an angry tone said that the check in is 4 PM and I have to pay 1,000 yen if I want to do early check in. I told her about the email, and without any empathy she said that must be an error. I felt so disrespected by her tone of speaking. I think she needs to be trained MORE! 

My recent stay at this hostel in Japan was a delightful experience overall. The staff were welcoming and provided efficient service throughout my time there. The dormitory room I stayed in was clean and cozy, offering a comfortable atmosphere for a good night's rest.

I particularly enjoyed the hostel's location, which was conveniently situated near public transportation options and within walking distance of various attractions. This made it easy for me to explore the city and immerse myself in the local culture without any hassle.

While the facilities were wellmaintained, I did find that the communal areas could get a bit crowded at times, especially during peak hours. However, this did not significantly detract from my overall enjoyment of the hostel.

Overall, I would recommend this hostel to fellow travelers seeking budgetfriendly accommodation in a convenient location. It may not have all the bells and whistles of a luxury hotel, but it offers everything you need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay in Japan. You get what you paid for. I would recommend this hostel and would stay here again but with notes.

The hostel is located right under a train track, as everyone have mentioned. The lobby lounge experience can be crazy  very loud with rocky vibrations. However, the room was ok for me, it was not as loud and rocky. Again, everyones standard is different and I was fine because I like white noises.

Another thing to point out. You make your own bed. They only give you the sheets and you have to set it up yourself.

The location is actually pretty central, only one station away from Namba, which is closest to Dotonbori Glico sign, Kuromon Market, and malls. Its close to a few stations. It also has relatively nearby konbinis and restaurants Yoshinoya. I think for the price, the location Im getting makes it super worth it.

The staffs were friendly. The place was clean. The lounge was cozy and got board games in Japanese. You can put your bag after checkout. The perfect hostel except for the noise. Its located directly underneath subway tracks and trains go from 51230. Its unbelievably loud. Will unfortunately not recommend this place because of that. The kindly provided earplugs did not help since the whole place vibrates and shakes.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Air con was a bit noisy, but great view from the window! I stayed there on fourth floor on February 8th 4pm for a night. The all was not bad as what people said of reviews on Google Map. Absolutely nothing complains. Every things has cleaned up. There were microwaves and humidifying air purifier. Two big and small towels. I wish that check out time was 11am. Not 10am. It was 3500yen booked on the day by Agoda. Great place for 40 a night. The receptionists have hatred in their hearts for foreigners here, checked in and they refused to talk to me and only my Japanese partner. Was so rude I let them keep the money and we left. Borderline racist or maybe Xenophobic as the man was pointing to his nose in a mocking manner as he talked to me like I was a dirty rat. And laughed when I asked for refund. Woman is just as bad, didnt want to make eye contact while talking to me and made my Japanese partner feel bad. Asking for extra information just to check in. We took our deposit back and left.

An older man with glasses and an oldfashioned 1980s miniAfro.

The hostess had a grudge against foreigners in the area, and after finishing the procedure, refused to accept other people and exchanged with me, but only with Japanese companions. When the other people finished the job, I learned that the other people were not allowed to hold it, and after that, I left the job. This name is a man's selfindulgent nose, the image is laughing at me, the good image is just an old mouse. When I resigned my request, others burst into laughter. The woman was also a single person, and when I was in contact with her, I had no idea and my eyes were in contact with God, and I had a feeling that Japanese companions had arrived. Please do not hesitate to provide us with any foreign information you request. After I returned the money, I left.

1980 1980 1980 1980 1980 1980 I stayed here for 2 nights to watch a baseball game.
The elderly person who helped me at checkin was very nice, but the foreign person at checkout was the worst.
I was treated like a bugger.
When I told them that I wanted them to keep my luggage, they seemed to be reluctant to ask, What time will you be back?'' Name and  number.'' This number sounded like a cell phone number, so I told them, and they seemed to be disgusted, saying, A room. number.'' I was told.

Since Kyocera Dome is nearby, I may stay overnight there in the future, but I will refrain from leaving my luggage there.

This foreign woman was truly the worst.","Monday: Open 24 hours

We met some gorgeous people of all ages, just a delightful experience
I am planning to come back many other times! I was here 5 years ago, and recently used this hostel again.

Excellent location, affordable, cozy and clean, good facilities hostel. Friendly and helpful staff.

I love that they have bicycles you can rent, making it easy to explore. There is convenient laundry machines, strong pressured showers with shampoo, conditioner, bodywash available. Paper towels and tissues in lounge. Close to convenience stores and restaurants. Japanese style bidet toilets.

In front of a cute school where you wake up to cheerful sounds of children playing and laughing.

Everything about the hostel is so convenient!!! I heard that staff is 24hr.
It is very suitable to visitors from whole the word.
But the JR station is a little distant from here. Spent 4 nights here. The location is pretty good  a ten minute walk from a station, 20 minutss to Dotonbori . The staff are really friendly and helpful, and even provided complimentary tea, coffee and toast. I had bad swollen ankles at one point and the staff gave me some pain patches which really helped. The place is spotless, and cleaned everyday. The bedspace is surprisingly spacious and had enough storage and plugs for my needs.  I would definitely reccomend staying here. Its one of the best hostels I've stayed in. The attention to detail is second to none. Thanks for a lovely stay! The room and common area is perfect! Although a little bit far from the center, you can feel the genuine Japanese living area. It provides free breakfast that brings traveler altogether to share our travel stories. I love its cleanness and serenity of the area!","Monday: Open 24 hours

hotel atarayo osaka,"Japan, 〒541-0058 Osaka, Chuo Ward, Minamikyūhōjimachi, 3-chōme−2−８ Hotel atarayo Osaka 1F",4.3,34.6789252,135.5029694,"I stayed for 3 nights with a room type L which is a small single room in ladies only floor and my experience was great. The room and the hotel is clean and in a nice location with multiple restaurants and 7 min walk to a train station. The bathroom, toilet and common area overall is very clean and tidy. i also like the make up area for the ladies with provided curling iron as well!! I had no problem using them at all and they even provided toiletries in the shower room too! Staffs were welcoming and helpful, you can put luggages with them after you check out. The room itself is small but manageable and i could fit my huge 23kg luggage inside and if you are tidy, you will be able to manage the space really well. it feels really cozy and comfortable with affordable price. Totally worth it and i would definitely come back! only thing that bothers me is the wifi connection in my room is kind of weak and the temperature gets a little hot in the room but it's totally fine, other than that i really like the place! The capsule had enough space for myself and the luggage. Bed was comfortable and the area is generally quiet at night. Staff speak good English and are very kind. You do need to take off your shoes and leave them in lockers on the first floor, just a heads up. The location is walkable to the very touristy Dotonbori and there is a 711 like 20 steps outside the hostel. Amenities like coin laundry, fridge, and microwave are available. Overall pretty good. Honestly just chef's kiss. I love how theres big lockers and another locker inside your capsule. Theres powder room, and wash room for your hands. Shower room can be a bit tight and might not be for someone who has phobia in tight places but everything is clean! Capsule is spacious enough and I like that theres little table inside to write and stuff. I'm impressed.. So sad I only have to stay here for a night. Will definitely be back. Clean rooms, modern aesthetic, very comfortable! Pajamas, slippers, and towels were given upon checkin.

Location is pretty nice, right next to a shopping street that goes all the way to Namba station, and is within a 5 minute walk of two subway stations.

I paid about 5k yen per night, which is very reasonable. By far the best capsule hotel I've stayed at so far.

Although I'm getting a little too old and my budget a little too high for the humble capsule hotel. I really think this is the best one so far.

Pros
 Sparkling clean.
 Enough space to open a carry on suitcase.
 Had plenty of air purifiers. Good for air quality and drowns the noise as well.
 Plenty of showers toilets. Locker okay.
 Staffs good. Kitchen good. Has shared fridge.
 Location walkable to shinsaibashi.
 Located in the neighborhood with plenty of restaurant and it's where you want to actually spend.

Cons
 Tad bit far from subways.

Conclusion
Very satisfactory. Since I don't need to stay in the capsule hotels anymore due to being able to afford more, there's very few I would intentionally stay at, and this is one of them for now.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Picnic Hostel Osaka,"2-chōme-8-3 Saiwaichō, Naniwa Ward, Osaka, 556-0021, Japan",4.3,34.6692699,135.4874343,"Very solid hostel, i paid 16 for a night, good beds with shelves next to the beds to put stuff which is always nice. Everything was overall very good and i don't remember anything to complain about. Decent location too Aside from the great location next to the station, This was probably the worst place I have ever stayed at. First encounter and greeting felt a bit cold and odd. Not sure if they were workaway workers, but when I walked in, 2 girls just stared at me as if I walked into the wrong place. The check in was very short worded and uncomfortable.
There was also an awful stench of staleness through the whole building and even in our room that even stuck to our clothes. Not sure if it was from the requirement of everyone having to take their shoes off in the lobby which is odd, or the garbage thats collected by the elevator, but the smell just made the place feel very unsanitary and uncomfortable. The bedding also seemed very dirty.

I think you can find way better value for more or less the same price. Dont recommend this hostel. Bedding looked as if someone already slept there, dorm was very smelly with stuff all over the floor and bags of trash in front of the entrance. Beds were also very uncomfortable. Comfortable rooms with aircon that works well.
Quiet location but close enough to walk to main attractions or get the subway. The staff are friendly and helpful. Shampoo, conditioner, soap provided. Hot water amenities. Only downside I would say is that the communal areas arent kept very clean and can become quite cluttered. Shoes are left everywhere in the doorway and there is limited cutlery  bowls in the communal kitchen if you want to prepare your own meals. This being said I would still recommend as the place is very relaxed and you can do your laundry wash and dry for 500 yen. I stayed there as accommodation staff and had a great time! The room is nice, the work was goodespecially reception and the location is just great, you can get by foot to amemura within 15 minutes. ","Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM

At first, I was impressed by the design of the hostel for its simplicity yet convenient and feeling clean, efficient as well. Although there are some unconvenient things like the passwords for entrance at certain hours, elevator . However, personally I believe it is a really good option for everyone who just need to stay for a while with very central location and independent environment for all the guests to come together.
Last but not least, White hostel gives me a more breathing space since the staffs can speak different languages, not so ""rule"" traditions work style so honestly, hostellover would love a place like this I think. Really good location, really close to convenience stores, restaurants and metro.

Me impression was, that this was not a great place to meet people. Everyone is doing their own thing.

Rooms were ok, bathroom and shower amazing The location was perfect and the staff was really nice and helpful. The only problem I had with it was I was hot in the beds and 2 of my roommates had a fight in the middle of the night. Everything related to this hostel was super cool. This hostel made my osaka trip totally magical. Their front desk guys are super super nice and friendly. You can sit in a cafeteria and eat or work. They also have free coffee etc. The Internet connection was super fast. Location is 5 minutes from dotonbri and america nura. Definately gonna book for my next travel trip!! Perfect ! Everything was super clean and confortable. Although we did have to make our own beds which was a first for me in a hostel. Great location","Monday: Open 24 hours

&And Hostel Hommachi East,"2-chōme-3-14 Tokiwamachi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 540-0028, Japan",4.5,34.6821409,135.5120075,"the staff were very friendly and informative and my room was clean. Room came with a hairdryer, 2 towels, private bathroomshower and a refrigerator. This is the best Hostel I have stayed at in Japan. If Im ever back in the area I will be staying here again! 8min walk to the train station, 30min to Dotonbori, multiple convenience stores within 5 min or less walk. The ONLY complaint for me is my room was quite cramped with my luggage  other things. Maybe a storage shelf or something would help. This is my personal experience at this place for 7 nights' stay.

Location wise, it is great. It is only half an hour walk to Dotonbori Street where you can bleed your leg until you run out things to do.

My room was on the 5th floor, and I can't say I really enjoyed it cuz you'd at least expect free slippers and a towel, which is currently being offered as a rental service. The room was dusty, and my pillow had a yellow stain, which was faint but unpleasant. I know it's ""u get what u paid for,"" but you can tell that they make this their excuse to get away from doing the basics. What I wanna say is my room wasn't as clean as I had expected it to be. The glasses girl at the reception could use a smile. Her reaction wasn't very friendly when I reacted in surprise that they charged you for towels and slippers and other amenities.

The overall feeling of the service is that this place felt like it's hiding behind the name hostel, implying they expect you to know they aren't a hotel. In fact, I couldn't help but overly feel like it's run by a group of college students who are there for fun. I couldn't really feel any sense of standardsespecially the glasses girl.

The saving grace was that they were kind enough to hold onto my belongings after my check out for a few hours. Did stay over a week after all. There is no desk person from 11 pm onwards. If you do not message them in advance for late check in, you can't access the room. Late check in costs 1000 yen additional. Almost daily people show up outside the building with a reservation and can't get in, so have to book an additional hotel in the city.

The facilities are nice. The showers most of the time have cold water. It's really nice!

We rented a private room for two people for around 30 per night. The room was very clean, hot shower, high water pressure, Panasonic hair dryer, amazing view of the city, clean sheets, soft bed, cold AC, nice lighting, lots of plugs, mini fridge, very quiet even next to the freeway, superfast WiFi, EZ check in, late night arrival okay  friendly staff members.

I asked if I could check out late and they said that I could stay two more hours but I had to pay 1,000 yen per hour.

There's a nice upstairs area you can hang out with a kitchen.

Easy 5minute walk to the station. Combini next door and about 30 minutes to the gate of Universal

Honestly, this place is great! 

Very much recommended  Got a great price for this place, good englishspeaking staff too. Breakfast was simple milk and oatmeal and croissants. Overall, it's a smooth checkin and checkout.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Everyday u can ask for new towel at the reception u must press the bell coz no one is standby. Got a free washing machine to use. Got 2 vending machine u can choose around hotcold tea and coffee, sodas. And ice cube. The staff is helpful and kind. Recommended. I booked a room with 2 bunk beds and 1 single bed. Very nice for me. And btw they dun clean up rooms. Well stay Namba was an amazing hotel. The rooms were quite compact, but that allowed a great experience. Well stay Namba is also located extremely close to multiple stores and the famed dotonbori. If I get the chance, I will definitely be coming back here. It was cheap, and reasonably well located within 600m of Dotonbori, and they were pretty good about changing our room when the first one allocated to us smelled of cigarettes.

However, service on early arrival was pretty poor. There was no luggage storage except 500yen lockers that don't fit larger suitcases, and the 'complementary' drinks station for guests was out of order, and the reception lady was having a bad day it was genuinely surprising to find a bossy, aggressive, impatient style person in Japan, such a contrast to everyone else. Stayed  here for a couple of days. Very clean and quiet. The room we got was great for a family or group of four. Located just a 1015 walk to Dotonbori area. Very near the restaurant street too. Osaka Wellstay hotel offers a prime location, modern amenities, and attentive service. The room was comfortable and clean, with thoughtful touches. The breakfast buffet was delicious and diverse.

The service and amenities itself are good, and they will help you with any questions you may have. Real option, cheap, comfortable, clean.

Leads to this hotel. Ekimae kita is north 3 blocks and west 1 block. They don't update their location or monitor either google maps locations. Stayed here for 2 nights for city break. The location is very good, just outside the subway exit. Front desk service is excellent with smile all the time. The room is typical APA style, comfortable bed and clean bathroom.

Area is pretty much all office buildings so not great for tourists. Arrived a few hours before the 3 pm check in and they would not let us go in early even though the rooms were empty. This area is not under high demand so not sure why. They did want to charge extra if we wanted to check in before 3 pm. We didn't on principle again this isn't a very busy area or time if year. Finally I asked for some water, they didn't have any, not even a drinking fountain, no vending machines, nothing. They just said to go find a store. So pretty lame. Would not recommend. My stay at APA Hotel Midosuji Hommachi was nothing short of excellent. The spacious and clean rooms provided a comfortable retreat after exploring Osaka. The courteous staff made the experience even better with their attentive service. Im definitely going to miss this placeOsaka truly feels like the perfect city to express and share my thoughts. Though the trip was short, it was an amazing and memorable experience. I look forward to returning! Stayed on the 31st floor for 6 nights 2 beds city view. Lovely hotel, although a small space, easy to get used to. Great location for the metro Hommachi station  3 major subway lines. Enjoyed all you can eat breakfast buffet for a small price and especially the spa open from 6am and until 3am part of APA hotel experience. Two convenience stores are 247 next door. Cute cozy hotel, simple but complete with basic amenities.  Rooms are compact but had everything you need for a comfortable stay. Toiletries were replaced daily and rooms cleaned every 3 days. Has a convenience store right beside the building and about 7 mins away from nearest train station and about 15 minute walk from Dotonburi. There is also a good selection of breakfast items here compared to other APA hotel that we stay in Tokyo. The front desk staff are very courteous and very helpful with our requests like the luggage transfer. The lobby was also nicely decorated for the holiday season. Nice place small, cosy and very cost efficient compared to other hotels around the area. Quiet area but close to the train stations. Right next to a shop aswell so that came in handy. We stayed and they were very clean, gave us new towels and toiletries every day and every 3 days changed all the sheets and refilled toiletries whilst we were out. Every day there were new towels left on the door handle. Greeted us every time they saw us and didn't have a problem what time we got In or left.","Monday: Open 24 hours

However, one of the Japanese women staff is so rude, I already speak in Japanese to her and her attitude is so bad, keep saying we don't have that. She doesn't even know there is a special bathing tub for hot spring which is mentioned on a poster in the hot spring area and hotel guests can get it in the front desk. However her attitude changed 180degree when I asked my Japanese friend to ask her. This is ridiculous. So if you are not welcoming foreigners then you should post on your website saying that we are not welcomed and then we will definitely not staying here We 2 adults and 2 kids stayed for a week in beginning of April and we love this hotel! Kids love the hot spring and free ice cream everyday.  Also, the free ramen after 945pm was great too.  However, we were too full everyday after dinner and we just had the free Ramen twice.  There was a nice supermarket near the subway station and it was convenient.  The coffee shop near the Main Street was nice too.  This hotel is not in the most touristy location but I like it as it was a bit quiet. This place was a treat! Quiet Hot Springs and lotsa freebies such as laundry dryer is 100yen but you need to do 2 rounds, 2 massage chairs, free Yakult drinks in the morning, free popsicle and ice cream bar in the afternoon  evening, free ramen after 930pm. We booked a room with 2 beds. It was spacious and comfortable. Location was not the best but we still enjoyed our stay. Not many good restaurants, it's more of a business district. Lotsa fancy stores if you like to buy high end treats. Steps from Kitahama Station and convenient stores. Rooms are great. We had two double beds. Room has a small refrigerator. Hotel has an onsen on the top floor with two hot baths, one inside and one outside, a sauna, and a cold bath. My only complaint is the lacj of food options during daytime hours. There are a few convenience stores near but most restaurants don't open until aft 530pm. Was not a huge deal since the station is near and you can simply go to another stop. Overall a great hotel. Food is shiat

Bed mattress airweave is as hard as a rock. Cheap and sub par quality. I think not even my dog want to waste time lying on this junk mattress

The pillow is as thin as air

Booked 5 nights here and this is my second night

But if you really want an immediate back pain and neck pain, don't hesitate to book a night here. 1 night is all you need. Book now

Can't sleep well

4 nights to go

Typical of Japan it seems, the rooms were small but comfortable.
Vegetarian options at breakfast were very limited.
Close, but thankfully not too close to the Dotombori area of the city. Great location. Rooms are as photographed, tight but functional. Room is not cleaned each day, for a 5 night stay I was eligible to sign up for 1 cleaning. Not mentioned by many people but the bed was extremely hard. I've a very firm bed at home but this was next level. If you need a soft bed, be warned. If I hadn't paid so much over 10k yen per night I would be more generous with my stars, but for the price it felt a little more budget than it should. I'd no issues during the stay, if I got a good deal I would probably stay again. Great value for a place to sleep in Osaka. The rooms are tiny, but clean and nice to sleep in. Location is very good, between two train stations of different lines allowing easy travel around Osaka. Nice little lounge on the 2nd floor wirh complementary snacks! Basically the worst customer service Ive ever had. Staff do not care at all about making sure you have a pleasant stay and managers hide in the back office and wont face you.
We checked into a room with a bed that was completely slanted, the springs had no support on one half of the bed. Told reception and they told me that all the mattresses are the same. I made them come up to see and the boy agreed it was broken and only then did he go speak to his supervisor. They then agreed to move us to a different room with no apologies at all.. the room they moved us to was noticeably smaller, and when asking them why he said they have booked out of all other rooms despite their being availability online and either pick the small room or the broken bed. I work as a hotel manager back in Australia and I would be mortified if my staff spoke to customers like this.
We ended up moving into the shoebox of the room with another very uncomfortableslanted mattress and horrible pillows.
Besides all that its ridiculous having to pay for a hotel where you have to take out your own trash and change your own towels and out of 7 nights only being offered to have the bedsheets changed once. The service was amazing, the room was very comfortable and clean, an the location is perfect because is in front to the train station.

Everyone we have met is very friendly and helpful so this is a good area to be in if you want to experience Osaka!
The staff is very friendly and greets us both when we go out and come back if we look their way.
The room has a little fridge, enough space for  couple of drinks and food. And a air condition, thank godness for that. It works perfectly too. The bathroom is tiny is the only minus here.

Absolutely a hotel worth staying in. Great spot with awesome services! Mr. Lin was super helpful during our checkin. The room was clean and had no strange odors. Plus, there's a supermarket nearby that's open late, which is fantastic. Ill definitely be back! I stayed at the hotel for 12 days. It was the most comfortable stay. The staff is excellent and special mention to Miura, from the time I checkedin they have been friendly and will assist you with almost anything that you need. I love the pyjamas, I brought my own pyjamas but did not use because theirs is fantastic. The hotel is near to convenience stores, a small mart, and 2 train stations. Once you learn how to navigate Osakas train system you are minutes away from any tourist spot. I will stay with them again when I return in NovDec hopefully. For Filipinos, Miura speaks Filipino and its one of the gifts for staying at this hotel. Very lucky to stay in here. The room is small but it's clean and wellmaintained. The location is very strategic. Moreover, Shih Hotel Staff is really helpful. Thanks Shih Great location, super clean hotel and room, cute shared areas, everything is brand new, very friendly and helpful staff especially Miura!

He refused to serve me and rudely point at me to go to the other guy. I found out later that he is a chinese migrant worker! The next morning, I ask to meet the manager, but he was not in, so I left to go to the airport. Just be careful guys, whom you speak english to! Only a few minutes walk from the subway station and tons of restaurants and shops nearby. I took taxi from Umeda area and only cost 1300.
All of the staff are very nice as you expect.
The room was spotless, but this Toyoko hotel has SMOKING rooms only. They do a great job cleaning and the smell is way better than I expected, but I could definitely smell the cigarette.
WiFi was not stable and sometimes got really slow. It took a long time to load a YouTube video.
Overall, it was a very good hotel for the price and I will be back if I am back in the area again! Lovely place,lovely staff. Nice and clean and quiet Hotel in an amazing area at Osaka. I've enjoyed in my room,and in the lodge every single minutes. They gave  the maximum for cheap price. This Hotel will be my choise,if  I get back to Osaka! Thank you Toyoko....6chome! A very good hotel that has extremely reasonable pricing! Bathrooms are a bit smaller than other hotels Ive been in on my trip but theyre still quite nice. It wouldve been nice to have a ledge of some sort and an outlet to charge a phone on both sides of the bed instead of just one side. Beds are high enough to store luggage underneath to utilize the room space better which is great. Breakfast being included was also very nice as a lot of the hotels I looked at did not offer this or I wouldve had to pay quite a bit more to include breakfast. Front desk staff were incredibly nice as well. I also liked that you can only use the elevator if you have a room key which adds a good sense of security. Great location close to train stations as well. Wifi was also very good as each room seemed to have its own wifi connection. Overall the hotel seemed very clean as well. I would stay here again! I recently had the opportunity to stay at the 'Toyoko Inn' Osaka, albeit just for the one night. I was very impressed with every aspect of the hotel. The service is what one would expect from staying at a Japanese hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My room was ideal for my purposes and, with the double glazing, any noise from outside didn't affect my sleep. The breakfast was just what I need to kickstart my day. It is a pity I am only able to give the 'Toyoko Inn' five stars, I would have given it ten stars plus. A big thankyou to all at the 'Toyoko Inn' Osaka for making my stay so pleasurable.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
RODISSON Hotel Osaka Uehommachi PARADIA,"5-chōme-2-3 Uehonmachinishi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0062, Japan",4.0,34.66783,135.519416,"Clean, fairly modern, friendly staff, large rooms by Japan hotel standards a few minutes from subway station. Price hard to beat  6000 yen 37 USD as of writing. 2 ramen shops on the block  Lawsons. The downside on this place the windows open up to a shaftway, 6 inches deep, so effectively you get some fresh air, but the view is 100 concrete. If youre just looking for a place to sleep or stash bags during the day, the nonviewnondaylight is an ok trade off for the price, IMO

Also a confusing element the Google Maps listings for the Axia Inn Hotel also shown as AxiaInn and the Rodisson Hotel Osaka Uehommachi Paradia seem to be mixed up.

523 Uehonmachi Nishi, Chuoku, Osakashi, Osaka, 5420062 is the address for Hotel Axia Inn Osaka Uehonmachi  not the nearby Rodisson Hotel that is shown in the Google Maps photos. If you follow the Google maps walking directions to this address, it will navigate you to the wrong hotel. From what I could understand from the front desk clerk, one of these hotels used to own the other, perhaps hence the mix up. A great location and price! Osaka Castle is only 30mins walk! As walking to Osaka castle, you will find all sorts of nice shops and stops! I will definitely come back and stay here!  The room size was 16m2 it was ok for a couple!! And loved  a small bath tub! Hahaha! A petito hotel.  Single rooms are very clean, but very small. The bathrooms are so tiny, and usable for all people only. It is located a few minutes walk to Uehonmachi station where shuttle buses to KIX leave. It is an ideal place to stay if you want to catch early flights at KIX airport.

Nothing really else around the area but the location is convenient. The hotel itself isn't bad, it's modern and the rooms are clean. The onsen area is open late and nice to use. Staff are friendly. I would say it's a decent value for the price. Free drinks almost all day long on 3rd floor. Rooms are always clean. Water pressure is awesome. Connecting rooms are available. There is an online monitoring system for the usage of washing machine, we can know if there are empty washing machines directly from the TV in our rooms.

Excellent hotel. I would give 1110 rating if they add more washing machines on 4th floor. There is usually a queue to use the washing machine, especially when someone is using the machine, put their PIN, and then ""forgot"" to pickup their laundries. 5Star Review

""I highly recommend this hotel for foreign travelers! The amenities and services are topnotch.

Highlights

 Convenient location, short walk from the train station take Exit 4
 Nearby osen hot spring and shopping mall
 Excellent welcome area with freeflow hot and cold drinks
 Kids love the complimentary ice cream!

The hotel is exceptionally wellrun, with no complaints from me. The staff's attention to detail is impressive.

Keep up the fantastic work! Big hotel with nice rooms and beautiful views.

But the location wasnt as convenient as I expected. Its not that close to ShinOsaka Station. If youve got luggage, it can be a hassle. The station is super busy, and you have to walk quite a bit to get to the trains. And the walk from the station to the hotel is long and pretty confusing.

If youre not planning on taking trains to other cities, I wouldnt recommend staying near this station. My family of five came to Japan for a week for vacation. We started our stay in Osaka, and we were lucky to have this beautiful accommodation. This hotel is very well located next to the ShinOsaka station.  The hotel itself is beautiful and modern. We were able to adjoining rooms with a door in between so that there was plenty of room for the five of us. The beds were very comfortable. The shower was without question the best shower experience we have ever had. Excellent water pressure! The staff was very friendly, and was helpful with regards to a few questions we had about recommendations in the area. Lots of food options nearby. Highly recommended!","Monday: Open 24 hours

I wouldn't trust the bathroom or washrooms. Other places with a slightly higher price point have way cleaner facilities. The no smoking room still smells like smoke. Love the place. More of a students lodging place though it welcomes everyone. It has shared baths rooms, spa, kitchen etc. everything is shared except your room. Still loved it for the price. Nothing fancy here. We were mostly out and just came to sleep and head out the next day. You can cook in the shared kitchen as well. Will definitely come back when in Osaka. Good location, close to the JR and metro.
Friendly and helpful staff, nice to have a kitchen and a common area.
The room we had was a 2 bed western style.
Spa looked cleaned. The shower room on the 2nd floor was very pleasant and clean! Schampoo body Lotion, etc. Even used laundry service 100 for 40min.
Helpful staff, recommend to stay for 12 nights. Very quiet when we stayed here.
Walking distance to the main attractions if you like walking 30min room looks ok but no washroom, but it's located outside at same floor. Showers are available at ground floor near to checkin counter. Hot  cold drinking water available at lobby area, beside has a mini restaurant. You can see translators available in lift and walls too. worth to stay with a reasonable budget hotel The staff were lovely and very helpful but thats about the only thing from giving this place 1 star. The hotel is VERY worn down. Definitely getting what you paid for. Bathrooms have pee on the floor and smell, showers are mouldy and our room had SO much dust and dirt. The actual beds werent too bad but the room smelt horrible and the pillows were bean bags. As well the walls are paper thin so you hear everything in the hallway and adjacent rooms.

Service is really bad though, they cannot help you with anything luggage, printing, any questions actually. Dont think Ive been to an hotel in Japan where they were so unhelpful, had to go to the hostel next door to have something printed. We stayed at Hotel WBF Namba for 4 nights. The room was small but wellequipped. The location is a little far from Shinsaibashisuji. It's fine. The hotel is in the residence area, so it's quiet during the night time.

The front desk provides 2 kinds of beverages, green tea and sports drinks from the afternoon until the evening.

Breakfast is moderate. Guests need to give the voucher when going to the meal place. The breakfast staff are friendly.

Receptionists are okay. They speak simple English and are also helpful. I would like to cut the tags. They not only lent me scissors but also provided a small bin at the lobby. Really considerate.  Do not recommend unless you want to have a terrible holiday experience.

Booked my trip last minute and chose this place due to good value price. Im totally ok with the room condition, while not ideal its a place that can meet basic needs, Im not complaining as its whats paid for.

But the male staff in the picture, which I screenshotted from another review funny to see someone had the exact same experience as me with him, was insanely rude. I called to ask for another quilt and explained that we had 2 people staying but only had 1 quilt. He picked up and directly replied that theres no blanket today what does that even mean? Did you eat all the blankets for dinner tonight? I put my request in Google translator and played it in Japanese so he could understand better, he then said in a demanding tone Please go down to the front desk. and hung up.

I went down and the 2 girls helped me instantly. Problem solved. The man came out from the back room murmuring something to them with the word quilt in Japanese.

Im not sure if hes the boss of the two girls, but please be serious about your job  listen to what the customers want, and try to be helpful instead of a jerk. Thank you. Rooms are just big enough to get 2 beds in. Breakfast was free but nothing special. Service and location was good. Room is very stuffy, and the service attitude is poor. I asked for rearranging the room since its that last one in the hallway and face to the window.

Regarding areas of improvement
 Internet is terrible I was on the 12f
 Cleaning was a bit inconsistent. I.e when I check in there were long hairs in my room. Also kept finding new ones on days after it was cleaned maybe the cleaners?. Also random as to what time of day they clean the room.
 The mirror at the door should be wall mounted to conserve space.

Positives
 Staff were helpful when queried calling a cab, changing money, etc
 Has a reasonably priced coin laundry

I am somewhat neutral on the location. Ie to get to the subway, a small trek, made worse by summer heat. But on the flipside I would say the exact location is quite good. From here you can access all directions of the city that are happening by walking which I do a lot. Average room and location. A negative point is that do not allow customer to leave luggage after checkout.
Noting Most accomodation do allow customer to leave luggage for a few hrs The receptionist is not Japanese, not friendly, refuses to accept orders for customers, every breakfast is the same, there is no ready drinking water in the room A friend and I came to Osaka for a few days to meet each other after years and have some fun together.

I happened to book the hotel room from a 3rd party app and the app offered us getting a single room with a small double bed but with the option of changing that bed for 2 twin singles. When we got to the hotel, we only had a single double bed but we talked to the reception and they saw that we asked for twin singles so she quickly offered to change the room for not only one woth 2 beds but they were 2 small doubles which was clearly an upgrade from the other one.

Thank you very much for the help and the amazing experiences there This hotel is not good for everyone, in this  hotel so expensive compared than other. Hotel room are so dirty , not proper cleaning and so much smell .
And what kind of housekeeping  vv lol  what the f..k
There is no stay room housekeeping.
Rude staff, didnt help us or provide information about the payment and other thing .

It is worth noting that it is located close to a junction. So, there is potential for traffic noise at certain times, though minimal. The WiFi coverage can be patchy in certain parts of some rooms but it is excellent in the shared space. A very nice and decent hostel, 30 min walk to Dotonbori which is nice for me who likes to walk.

The staff is nice and friendly, but it is a greedy hostel where you have to pay for them to keep your luggage and even towels.

The beds are a bit noisy and madras are okay, but thin.

Overall a decent hostel with free foot baths I recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel, and I couldnt be happier with my experience. From the moment I walked in, the staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive. The lobby was beautifully decorated, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. We stayed here for two nights.  Everything is great here. It's convenient, clean, with very helpful staff.  The foot soak is a nice surprise. My first reaction was that it was much more beautiful than the ones in the photo. It has a very warm atmosphere and friendly staff. The dining area and kitchen are quite large. Their combination of both modern and traditional design is also very impressive. The price is quite good in terms of performance. 5 min walk to Tennoji station. We stayed as a family in a 4person room. The rooms are really big and comfortable. Thank you for everything.

Osaka Tomato Guesthouse,"2-chōme-7-4 Nishinakajima, Yodogawa Ward, Osaka, 532-0011, Japan",3.9,34.7229745,135.4959418,"Customers are given bedsheets and are told to make their own beds. Maybe this is common in some places but I've never had to make my own bed when i'm paying good money for a nights sleep, even at much cheaper places. And after a long day it was a rather annoying surprise. Other people staying there who i asked said they felt the same way. On the bright side, at least you know you're getting clean sheets.

Overall this was a decent place to stay that did all the basics fine. But it was my least favourite of the 4 different hostels I've stayed at in Osaka. The location is north of the Yodo river making it quite far out from the main stuff in central Osaka. The guy running the place was very formal and didn't offer a particularly warm welcome. At 18 for a night it was not expensive, but other places i stayed were cheaper, more enjoyable and in better locations.

The Tomato theme was definitely interesting and is something i wont forget so that could be a positive depending on if you like tomatoes. 15 bucks was pretty good and met some pretty cool foreigners like me.  It also has a more traditional Japanese washroom, which I happen to love.  I felt as though I was treated a little bit coldly. I had a lovely stay here, thanks to the amazing staff and the super cute tomato theme! I wasn't expecting everything to be tomatothemed! I even got a picture in the tomato room. D Highly recommend this spot, it's great when you're on a budget! The only thing I would note is there's only TWO bathrooms to be shared among a ton of people so I felt like I needed to rush because I was taking up the shower room while just washing my face. I wish there were more sinks! Tomato guesthouse is a great place to stay, it is well located, next to the river, it is very calm located next to the river to chill a bit and the stations are just 5 minutes away with konbinis too! The staff was incredibly nice, taking care of knowing if you are comfortable and having a nice stay, that place is kept very clean and the tomatoes everywhere shows how passionate the owner is, its really nice to see! I would definitely recommend staying there! Thank you! Cozy and affordable stay close to Osaka. The guesthouse has everything you need and the host is super friendly and helpful.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM

You get what you pay for. The room was more spacious than some other hostels which is great. Everything is made really cheaply including the bed which is made of plywood so not very comfortable. The room was clean, so where the showers but the toilets could use cleaning more than once a day because of the amount of people. Not every floor has a toilet for each gender.

The location is convenient. However it is located in one of the roughest neighbourhoods in the city and probably all of Japan. Being Japan this means it is not actually dangerous or comparable to bad neighbourhoods in other countries. I would advise anyone however to read about the surprisingly dark history of this area. While a lot has changed here in the last 1015 years, it is still a very poor neighbourhood that has recently been overrun by tourists. Keep that in mind and be respectful to the people living around here. Also do not be surprised to experience a Japan that you might not have believed even existed. There a many great cheap restaurants with lovely people in the area, if you treat them with respect you can have a great time. There is a cockroach in the room. This the the third month I stayed in Japan, and the only place that have cockroach in it.

The air conditioning unit is dripping. Luckily my electric appliances were not near it when I realised.

Others are written in descriptions, shared bathrooms and showering rooms. Your room only has beds, kettle1 is shared in common area. They provided ear buds because the sound proving is horrible.

Worst place I stayed. If you dont mind the above issues it was nice for a cheap price.
It was my fault that I picked this place, dont be me.

no refunds too. Silly me. If you get it for a good price, id say this place is alright. I liked everything except I thought that they could provide more quality slippers. When I first checked in, I was met with a burly man, who was friendly I suppose, but I thought the customer service was lacking because he left five minutes earlier than posted and that's when I came down to ask for an extra pillow lol. However the next day when I came in the morning because I lost something, a male female duo greeted me with reverence. They had some of the best CS I've seen in my whole life. So I suppose It matters who you get. The location is perfect, not too close to town centre but close enough to walk. Train stations were very close less than 5 minutes walk. Rooms were clean but tiny, toilets were hard to find and also tiny. There were very few toilet stalls. Bathrooms were great, I'm tall but didn't feel constricted. Stayed here before our flight out of Japan. The location is really good because there are nearby train stations and a donki too!

The room we had was clean and okay. The toilet however, was an inconvenience as theres only one female or male toilet in a floor. I believe even floor are male only toilets and odd floors are female only.

Ive been to various hostelshotels in Asia and Europe and this is the first place Ive been to who doesnt let their guests keep their luggage.

Very close to Nippombashi station and is walkable to all the attractions in Osaka if you don't mind it being a hostelmotel.

Please do not expect much, and like the other reviews, the whole place has a dark wet moldy vibe to it.

You check in using the machines, so basically not much interaction with the staff is needed.

For the price, I will choose to stay at a 'proper' hotel instead as it is not cheap as well.

Rooms are dusty, has a smell, and has stains here and there.

A lot of Koreans stay here and the staff can also speak Korean well, if that is what you need. The hotels location is excellent, right next to Dotonbori. There are convenience stores and restaurants everywhere, and transportation is convenient with Namba Station offering direct access to the airport. Overall, the experience was very good. We arrived at the hotel before the checkin time, but they stored our luggage for free so we could explore before checking in later in the evening. If you want to check in early, it costs 1,000 yen. The room was clean and comfortable, but I must say its a bit basic. If location is your top priority, this hotel will satisfy you, but if you have high expectations for the room itself, it might not be the best choice. Also, you can hear cars at night, so I recommend bringing earplugs if youre a light sleeper. For the amount of slack this place gets, its understandable but also a great area to stay especially if you want to be near Dotonbori and a literal 5 minute walk from the train stations. The rooms are small but thats to be expected. It does a laundry room so expect to either stay up late or wake up early. I opted out for the breakfast but overall great place to stay. It was a quick check in and check out process. The location is amazing, central to everything!!
The rooms were not bad we managed, except we had to be moved from one room to another room due to the fact that the washroom had a really bad smell to it, almost like a poo  or smoke  smell, and we ended up moving to another room, and that room also smelled awful, but we didnt want to keep complaining  we tried everything to get rid of the smell, but nothing worked, it either needs to be cleaned with stronger smelling fragrances or maybe light a candle. The bathroom shower liner was also not clean and I noticed black mold on the walls of the shower, and white film on the shower walls. We booked months ago so the price was lower than advertised. We have stayed a Fresa Sotetsu hotels that are primarily business hotels. This is tourist hotel with almost 700 rooms serving bus loads of tourists and this influences the overall character.  The morning breakfast for 1400 yen is a bargain.

no amenities in room, but you can get it  from the lobby, I personally love the GREEN concept including not changing your bedding in the first three nights. they do provide housekeeping if you need it but otherwise, they will give you fresh towels in a bag hanging on your door.

the highlight is the free breakfast. amazing selections change every day. very tasty and fresh. thanks to all the hardworking ladies in the kichen. I eat more breakfast more than ever during my stay and feel full till way pass lunch time.

the chekin was smooth as the staff do speak enough English to complete the process. get a membership card if you like, I do this with every chain business  hotels in Japan  as I come here very often. the fee is really minimum compare what you can save booking directly on their website.

overall. very satisfying stay. I don't know why ppl complain about the tiniest inperfections. this is post covid and many thingsstandards have changed, roll with it and move on! Visiting from the United Kingdom. Fantastic hotel located in the heart of Den Den Town.

The location was superb, if you are an active traveller and like to be out and about most times, I would highly recommend this place. It is 10 minutes walk from the main city Center and 8 minutes walk from the train that goes straight to and from Kansai International airport. There is a Lawson just across the street and a 711 and an anytime fitness just around the corner. They also have a rooftop bar seating area where you can overlook Osaka and see the tower which is also just a 10 minute walk away

The rooms were small but this is to be expected in Osaka, given the service, location and comfort of the beds and pillows, this is actually a really good room and good value for your money, as most rooms elsewhere will be similar in size but not as good quality. There is good water pressure and hot water. The check in was very easy and they have a smoking room and weighing scale for bags downstairs.

We opted for the free breakfast and it was great. Good selection of healthy food and it filled us up til late lunchearly dinner. The place is very clean.

Would recommend for those looking for a comfortable place to come back to after a long days worth of walking and exploring. We stayed here for 5 nights and we really like our stay. The rooms are nice and the bathroom is big enough. The service is great, they let you store your luggage before your check in so you can explore the city meanwhile. Theres a rooftop bar as you can see in my photos which gives amazing views of the city however teach time we went up the restaurant was closed during our stay. Theres location is not great since there are two major highways and railways on each side so youll hear trains passing by until midnight so thats something to keep in mind. Any other than that, I would stay here again because of the price and service we got. Rooms look new but hygiene is bad which is very unusual for Japan. Room service for cleaning of the room is terrible. They only give you a new set of towels n empty the dustbin, no making of the beds, cleaning of the floors or anything. So if you stay here for a few days, the floor n beds starts to accumulate hair n dirt n feels pretty icky.

Also, its 5mins from the train station but the station is pretty remote, only the local train stops here n is bypassed by all other train types Easy access to both Nankai Electric Railway and Osaka Subway. There is a convenience store right in front of the hotel. Parking for cars is available at the coinoperated parking lot shown in the photo, which is just around the corner. The hotel was larger, newer, and cleaner than I had imagined. Drip coffee and various types of black and green tea bags are available near the checkin counter. Rooms are compact, but I think the cost performance is quite good. Great hotel! Simple check in, simple check out. There is a roof top with an ok view! Golden hour is very beautiful! But nobody was ever there and pretty much empty. There are only 3 sets of washing machines and dryers but a Laundromat is really close but much more expensive 1600 yen for washing and drying for 60 min. A lawson is right next door so perfect to grab a snack before coming back for the night. The room was big enough for 2 adults backpacking but still small if you are used to american standards. Tv with no castingmirroring options but we had a chromecast so we could watch our tv series. One thing to watch out for is that there is a highway and a train track next to the hotel so you might have some noise. We were next to the train tracks and until the last train, we could hear the trains! But once the service stops, it is very quiet! The beds were good and the staff were really nice.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hotel LiveMax Osaka Honmachi,"3-chōme-1-13 Kyūtarōmachi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 541-0056, Japan",3.2,34.680904,135.5029904,"Our room was mold on shower curtains  but Omakura and her staff were so kind to clean it for us as they didn't have new ones. The front desk staff were not very helpful and enthusiastic to help the guest, but the cleaning team was always so kind and helpful. Terrible Hygiene and Poor Service at Hotel LiveMax Osaka Honmachi

I had a very disappointing stay at Hotel LiveMax Osaka Honmachi due to the terrible hygiene and unprofessional service. The room was filled with an unbearable odor, which seemed to come from the air conditioner that was covered in mold. The moment the air conditioner was turned on, the already unpleasant smell in the room became overwhelmingly foul and awful. Even setting the air purifier to the highest level did nothing to improve the situation, indicating that the air conditioner hadn't been cleaned for a long time.

Additionally, the shower curtain in the bathroom was also covered in mold, which made showering extremely uncomfortable as it was impossible to avoid contact with it. Staying in such an environment made me constantly worry about the impact on my health.

To make matters worse, the service at the front desk was equally unsatisfactory. When I approached a female staff member with a question, her only response was No, you cant, without using any polite language or showing any courtesy. Such rude behavior only added to the unpleasant experience.

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The room is very small and there was a weird substance on the curtains also it was very dusty in some places.
It is close by shopping street so you dont have to walk far for food or other stuff.
The check in was at 1500 which is inconvenient. The staff here require foreign residents to submit ID to be copied. As others have pointed out, this is against the law. Seems like a new hotel but rooms are already a bit shabby and dirty, and very small even for Osaka. Should have read other reviews before booking. No luggage storage at all. Plus check in at 1500. Good luck if you are coming from another hotel as most places have you check out at 1100.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Umeda Little Chapel Christmas,"11-5 Dōyamachō, Kita Ward, Osaka, 530-0027, Japan",3.3,34.7034896,135.5042583,"This is my first time using this hotel.

We had a very comfortable stay and would like to use our hotel when coming from far away.
Every corner of the room was clean and wellmaintained, and I was able to spend a relaxing time, so it was very nice.

It has excellent access from the Higashidori shopping street, and is in a good location.There is also a coin parking nearby, making it easy to get there by car.

I would like to use them again. Thank you. What's going on with the training of the blonde pigfaced front desk employee who came to work today?
He had a very rude attitude toward customer service, showing no morals or concern for the guests, loudly saying that he didn't want to add to the troublesome work he was doing, bossily lecturing them, and warning them about unnecessary things.

I think the Chapel series was strict about customer service and appearance, but what is going on?

I have told them not to close their rain gear inside because it is a moral issue, but how about telling visitors that they should not close their rain gear inside since it is a hassle and requires a lot of cleaning?
If so, shouldn't we put a sticker on the door?
Do you work at the front desk because you want to have fun, and when you get tired, you have a bad attitude and get angry at customers when you try to reduce your workload?

Also, there is only one elevator, so you have to face each other because there is no consideration, and since there are so many people these days, if you don't keep your distance, it will get in the way.What do you think about them saying unnecessary things every time without morals? ?
The other staff members try to serve customers quietly and politely without looking at their faces, but who is the one who has no morals? I think they should be reeducated or cleaned more properly. The best part is that it's located right next to the Higashidori shopping street.
It is wellmaintained and has a clean feel.
Shampoo and other products are displayed in the lobby, and you can use your favorite brands.
The free drinks and food were delicious as well.
There is a morning service in the morning, and the cost performance is good.
A hotel I would like to visit again. There's nothing particularly dirty about the hotel, and the exterior and interior of the hotel fit the Christmas concept, making it feel good. The ashtray is also cute.
However, although it can't be helped, due to the location, it was quite noisy outside on Saturday night. If the room is quiet, you can't tell if it's a club or a bar, but you can hear the loud music from nearby nightlife establishments. I used it the night before a business trip. It's a little hard to find, but there's a shopping street with an arcade nearby, so you can go out freely and it's very convenient. It looks old, but it was well maintained and comfortable to spend time in. The staff was polite and helpful, allowing me to check in even if I arrived a little early. In addition, the price was modest, so it was a hotel with good value for money. thank you very much.","Monday: Open 24 hours

We were greeted off our taxi, escorted to the check in area where we were seated for check in and offered a welcome beverage. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful along with speaking very good English.

The room was very nice, large like all st Regis properties. Very good attention to detail, bathrooms was very well stocked. Bedding was on point. Our butler arrived offering welcome drinks and some snacks. He was wonderful, accommodated every request we made including arranging transportation to the airport on check out day as we needed a larger van.

Great location, right beside subway stop, short distance to go anywhere around Osaka. For the price paid 90k yen per night I expected much more.

Service is consistently good but staff generally do not have a good sense of urgency.

Breakfast was mediocre for a 5 star hotel, but allowed me to pack and go so that's a plus.

Lacking in facilities with only a simple gym and no pool, lounge or shower facilities.

Best part of the hotel might be the in room shower. Multiple shower heads and strong water pressure. Laundry service was relatively reasonably priced.

Location is right on top of a metro station. Convenient. During my stay, I encountered multiple service issues that highlighted a significant need for improvement in understanding and delivering true Japanese hospitality, especially compared to neighboring hotels. The rooms are noticeably in need of renovation, and the hotel overall requires several upgrades to enhance its condition.

Despite these shortcomings, the bar stood out with its beautiful ambiance and an excellent selection of drinks. The breakfast was adequate but could use some improvement. Given these factors, I would rate the overall experience as 3 out of 5. However, due to the perks provided through my status, I have decided to rate it a 4 out of 5. Staying at the St. Regis Osaka was an exceptional experience! The picturesque views from the rooms are breathtaking, offering a stunning panorama of the city thats especially beautiful at night. The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive to every detail, making sure our stay was perfect from start to finish.

Breakfast was a real highlight, with a wide selection of delicious options that catered to all tastes. The room service was equally impressive, with meals arriving promptly and beautifully presented. The level of cleanliness throughout the hotel was impeccable, and it really added to the overall sense of luxury.

The hotel is very much central. Walking distance to the shopping areas, market and Dotonbori river.

I highly recommend the St. Regis Osaka to anyone looking for an unforgettable stay in the heart of the city. I can't wait to return! We had a great stay at St Regis Osaka. We are big champagne fans and we made sure to attend the sabor ceremony everyday that we were there. Butler service was amazing, got a couple shirts pressed, which made a big difference for photos. The hotel was crowded on our first day, but they had adequate overflow capacity in the other restaurant for breakfast, and the food was great as well!

A few areas of improvement the room we stayed in is overdue for renovations. Our room wasnt ready when we arrived and we were told to come back in 20 mins. However, the check in staff that helped us initially wasnt there when we returned, so there was a bit of a mix up.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

If you come to Osaka and budget is concerned, I suggest this hotel is suited. a nice small hotel specially designed for corporate training use..A lot of training or seminary rooms.  Service is good, very clean with decent rate. Quiet difficult to follow the direction. I'm not a 'map girl' and so many times I failed in reading maps.

The entrance is off to the side of the main road so you may miss it. The staff were very good and friendly , gave us good directions and recommendations for eating. The room for us was comfortable enough, and at reception they have free coffee, hot chocolate cold water and hot water available which I used . On level 2 is 2 washing machines and 2 dryers that you can use. We had a good stay thank you  Lovely hotel with spacious rooms for this price point. Room was clean and smelled nice all the time. They also have a massage cushion which was great after a long day of sightseeing. Great location as well.

They provide sleepwear, and they have a bathroom amenities buffet in the lobby. They also have a coffee machine and tea bags in the lobby for free. Overall excellent value for money and comfortable stay. Overall a pretty good spot to stay. It took awhile for the hotel room to cool down but once it did the hotel room stayed cold. Location was pretty decent since there was a brown line station 23 minutes walk and a red line about 8 minutes walk from the hotel. Not a whole lot of food choices nearby but if you don't mind traveling a little bit you can find a lot more choices. Room size was ok but hotel didn't provide water for the room. They offer free coffee and water in lobby though. There are no closet space or under the bed space to place your luggages so you have to make due with what's available. The room was very spacious, clean and tidy. There was a massage cushion in the room and its good for relaxing at night. Staffs are friendly. The breakfast buffet was good. The location of the hotel was a bit far from the railway station, 510 minutes walk but still acceptable. Good place, quite a nice breakfast. Strange thing is that they don't wash the cups when you ask for room cleaning.

Shrines, temples, and popular districts are only a few minutes walk.
I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Osaka! Hightly recommend!! The room is the largest we have had during our stay in Japan.
The many little extra amenities are fun and they have thought of everything.
The position is perfect.
The cleanliness could be improved. Greatly positioned hotel to access central areas of Osaka. Unlimited access to drinks and snacks, and a whole range of amenities and toiletries. A unique experience. We were so impressed with this hotel. The service was great and all the free amenities, drinks and food was a real treat. Great location also! Would definitely stay here again.

The bathroom is not large enough for anyone larger than average size. There is little bench space or storage. Breakfast is average and the wait time for the lift is ridiculous. Staff at the front desk are hospitable and helpful. Could do with better laundry facilities also. Mouldy Air Conditioning  We stayed here for 4 nights. On the final night we noticed mould inside the air con unit. When reported to the manager and staff at reception, they did not seem at all bothered. One member of staff also laughed when I showed the attached video. They then offered to refund 1 breakfast in compensation, which makes a mockery of the situation.
Hopefully this does not impact our health and they remedy this issue before anyone else stays in the room. However given the attitude of the staff, this may not happen. Hotel is in a good location but noisy. Heard lots of banging from other guests in the hotel which disrupted sleep. The Aircon was extremely loud and found out on the last night that it was full of mould, the room is extremely stuffy and musty without the Aircon on but we couldn't use it as we were worried about getting sick The room is a bit small, so I couldn't open my suitcase in a convenient spot, and the TV is awkwardly placed on the wall to the left of the bed. But other than that, everything was great! The housekeeping staff were friendly and polite, and even though the front desk staff seemed a bit inexperienced, they stayed calm and handled everything well. We recommend it
Great location, close to everything. About a 7min walk from Dontonburi with lots to look at in the way. Room was good, had everything we needed. Not a lot of walking space but enough  you arent living there. Managed to get our washing done, you do need to get in with everyone else so dont leave till the last minute. Breakfast was awesome. Sorting out bags to be sent to our next place was easy to do at reception. Thank you!

As a foreign visitor, I was not able to register on their website as member, thus missing out member discount of 3500 Yen. I hope they can improve on this as there are many Via Inn around Japan. With this I most probably won't stay with Via Inn again. The Single Room A was rather compact. I had to move around the chair to make more space to walk around. The window does not open so it was another disadvantage. The laundry room was located in the smoking floor. This was another inconsiderate design especially to those visitors who doesn't smoke. The good things with this place were that there is a 711 downstairs and you can order food delivery from local restaurants. There is a walking distance of 1015 minutes to JR Shin Osaka station. It will not be a good choice if heavy rains are expected. The hotel is around 10 minutes walking from the station but there are escalators or elevators in the way so it not that bad even if you have a big luggage. 711 right by downstairs is quite convenient.
For the room, it is decently clean if you dont look at the walls closely or dont check the corners for dust.
The biggest issue would be the ventilation system, if somebody is smoking in a room nearby, the smell going to get to you too. Also, you can hear other habitants because of how the rooms ventilation is connected.
Amenities were not bad, but for women I would recommend bring their own skincare. The good part about amenities is coffee. Pretty good. I made a reservation coming up in 3 weeks October 5 2024 and sent 2 messages via their website but no reply
can I check in after midnight?
can I store luggage after check out until my train later in the afternoon?
Please check your messages! Good Location, less than 5 minutes walking from shinosaka station. Very convenient.

I think the last the room was cleaned is, after just the hotel building was created. The Livemax in East Shinsaibashi is in a great location and the staff were excellent.
The room was fine, it had space and all the needed features.
The price was also competative for the location, time and facilities of the hotel.
The only thing I felt was missing is that there was no ice machine on any floor which was unfortunate given the heat of the Japanese summer.

However this is all general information for staying in the hotel, our stay was unfortunately coloured by an unpleasant incident. Due to the aforementioned Japanese summer and lack of ice the first thing I did on arrival was to fill the bath with cold water to cool off. Once I removed the plug the water drained from the bath but then came up from beneath the toilet from the drain there accompanied with a foul smell.
I don't know if there was a blocked drain or if this was a one off but it severely restricted our use of the bathroom as the foul smelling water across the floor was not something we wanted to stand on or clean.
I could not report this at the time as it happened quite late at night and we had to leave in a rush, the staff on duty at those times had limited English and my Japanese was not adequate to communicate.

As long as this issue was a one off I would recommend this hotel. Although situated near Dotomburi, but relatively cheap. My single room with twin bed was very small, but equipped with everything necessary.  Near by the hotel, the nightlife is very robust and vibrant and has many things to do,  eat or buy. The worst hotel Ive ever stayed.

Room was dirty and disgusting, smelled bad.
Floor looked like someone puked on it, I dont even want to think what happened to the walls. I found garbage under my bed, microwave was dirty, shower curtain is covered in mold and sink was clogging up just by water.

This is horrible horrible place that must be avoided by all costs.

Twin room layout made sense and we never lacked for anything during our 5 day stay. The only minus point is the breakfast which underdelivers for the cost. If you're staying 12 days it's fine, but for longer stays you'd want more variety andor daily change. See other people's complaints for photos. The laundry on the 4th floor was very convenient. 400 yen for 30min wash, 100yen for 30 min dryer. If they decide to fix the breakfast situation, I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Osaka, considering the affordable price, good staff and perfect rooms. Its a nice new hotel thats in a quiet residential area. The room was very spacious and clean.

The train stations nearby are about 57 minute walk. If you want to check out dotonborishinsaibashi, you can walk for about 20 minutes.

You can also take the train too. Theres a Family Mart nearby which was convenient for late dinners and snacks.

Overall, its a decent hotel at an affordable price! We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The room was impeccably clean, and the reception staff were exceptionally polite and helpful. We appreciated the complimentary amenities available for use, including a hairbrush, tea, and coffee. However, it's worth noting that the room does not include a microwave. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay. This hotel was great. A very convenient location only 15 walking from Dotonburi. Rooms were quite big  spacious. The big bed was very comfortable the smaller one was very hard, but we finally slept both in the bigger one so it was not a problem. The service was amazing. They even called a restaurant for us since we dont speak Japanese and changed a reservation. Great quality price! Doesnt get better than this! Make sure to book this hotel! Thank you! Location is good. Lots of eateries and convenience stores along the street. It's also a short walk to either Nagahoribashi Station or SakaisujiHommachi Station, which connects to major tourist attractions.

We booked the triple room for 3 persons. The room size is bigger than what is shown on the website. We could open our 3 huge luggages and still have space for more. Rooms are also clean and new. There is a cafe and water station on 2F.

Service is good and staff speaks English, however they are only available from 7am11pm. The place is unmanned after those hours.

Our room had a blackout one night while I was using the hairdryer, not sure what was the cause. Thankfully it was just 3 minutes before 11pm and we were able to get hold of reception before they clocked out for the day. They fixed it with 10 minutes. Thank you to the young man for being so professional.

There are free amenities available on the 1F.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The room is so clean and well maintained, with a range of facilities such as iron, slippers and two types of pillows  soft and hard. Also comes with air purifier and a mini fridge. Most impressed by the staff's helpfulness, I requested a quiet room on the high floor not facing the main road and was delighted to find that they have allocated the exact type of room I was looking for, never had such fuss free experience elsewhere. There's also an inroom flat panel for guest to select cleaning options and find out recommended restaurants nearby. I'm so pleased with my stay, will definitely come back if visiting Osaka again! Service is exceptional. We couldn't book a nonsmoking room, but on the day of checkin they let us change to a nonsmoking room upon asking, free of charge and no questions asked. Felt a bit sorry that they now have to clean 2 rooms for one guest.

Other than that, they've got immaculate rooms and facilities, good commodities, good everything. Give this hotel a chance if you stop by Osaka. Bigger than expected 
I was reading reviews prior to booking and they all said small but the room is like perfectly fine especially for Japan. The staff was friendly and welcoming ready to help with all questions. On the second floor is vending machines that sell cool drink and alcohol and there are washing machines onsite with a microwave in the same room. They change the towels everyday and make the bed etc but deep clean every 3 days for longer staying guests. The subway is called NAGATA you exit through exit 1 its literally 100 ft away you can see it as you exit. So convenient. There is also a car park on site . Will Definitely return. Thanks so much Richmond! It's wonderful no matter location, accommodation, service and price but, except the room a bit tiny especially for the bed size. We were reserved for two adults and two children children free. However, the bed just enough for two adults only. If they could improve such issue, I should give them 5 stars for sure. Hidden gem. Room size is more than average. Breakfast is ok. Reception is helpful. Bit dated but renovated properly.

和空 下寺町 WAQOO Shitaderamachi,"2-chōme-5-12 Shitaderamachi, Tennoji Ward, Osaka, 543-0076, Japan",4.6,34.6557215,135.5103441,"We loved everything about this hotel and experience. It was clean and tranquiljust what we needed. The Zazen sessionlesson in the evening was an amazing experience. The monk leading the session was both funny and helpful for our whole family.

Breakfast is not to be missed as well! It was the perfect quiet way to start our day before Universal Studios. We only stayed a single night in Osaka, so we were in and out of this hotel pretty quickly. It is a lovely hotel, clean, with very good service and a very nice design aesthetic. Our room seemed to be a decent size. We had booked a room for 3 people, so the 3rd bed took up a fair amount of the floor space. That said, it was still quite a bit more spacious than the hotel we stayed at in Kyoto. The 2 primary beds in the room were the biggest weve had in Japan so far, they were probably both Full mattresses. However, the 3rd bed was an extremely hard mattress, and my son complained that it was uncomfortable.

The hotel is located in a somewhat quiet area, you wont see a whole lot of tourists walking around, the street isnt busy, and not many people walking about. The area seems to have quite a few automotive businesses, which, as an auto enthusiast, I found interesting, but others in my group were less interested.

This was towards the end of our japan trip and we were getting pretty tired so we used a taxi to get to and from the Dotonbori area. Its a quick and inexpensive taxi ride, only about 5 minutes away by car. The hotel isnt super close to any metro or rail stations, but seems to be equidistant to about 4 different stations.

There hotel was very accommodating in holding our luggage for us when we arrived in the morning, long before checkin, as well as holding it for us after we checked out. The only real inconvenience was that checkout is a little early, at 1000am. My budget for my trip to Japan allowed roughly 100AUD a night for accommodation. For just under that price Waqoo absolutely over delivered. The staff are polite, the building and rooms are gorgeous, and if youre after somewhere thats peaceful and Zen, well, its a Buddhist hotel and it certainly delivered on that. I would be back here for every Osaka trip Rooms are simple and cozy. According to their website this is a shukubo 

""Shukubo"" means temple lodging, an accommodation for worshipers visiting temples and shrines.
Originally, it was a facility where only priests were allowed to stay, or a cathartic facility for pilgrims.
However, in recent years, more and more shukubo have been accepting tourists.

But read little prints because everything is about money. It seems like everything you do here cost a lot of money. Dont loose your card or be careful of the amount of people you select in check in because the price of the rooms vary a lot according to the amount of people are in the room. Also you pay a lot for the hotel to hold your luggage.. see picture below..Everything seems money driven for a temple lodging.
The staff were very helpful, but I am not sure I was aligned with the hotel philosophy. Out of the roughly 10 hotels on my trip to Japan this time, this hotel I was very excited about in particular. And it did not disappoint!
I love the minimalist, light style of the exterior, interior and the food. I was also looking forward very much to the meditation but due to my time here being limited, I cant make it.
If you like to go to Osaka to have fun, Shinsaibashi is super close. The traffic situation sucks a bit, which means that going to namba takes about as long by foot as by train roughly 30minutes, so I personally just walk every time. Super walkable in general. If youre in the area and have no tattoos I also really recommend Spa world close to shinsekai.

I love the aesthetic and the vibe, staff are very friendly and polite, but in a laidback, kansai kind of way. The front desk staff were also really nice and chatted to me for a bit and they make you feel like they really care about you which I appreciated a lot as a solo female Traveller.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

I really like how they ve made the most of the space in the rooms which actually felt fairly spacious.

We also had a descent view.

The only think we didn't like was the restaurant on the second floor, a bit to exotic for my wife and I.

But all in all amazing hotel, would go back. Not worthy as its frame n price.
definitely not a 4star hotel n overpriced in the given standard.
Luckily I Hv only stayed 1 night
Totally understood the hotel was 10yrs old but i believe hygiene standards could be met somehow .The rooms are extremely outdated, dust allover lampshade Pilling bedhead    black marks on the wall lack of cleanliness and overall age of the hotel were apparent.No visibility through the window because was frosted.
However, staff was helpful with great service.
Hope this comments will help to improve the standard but not an excuse on the age of the hotel. We had an event nearby to attend and this made it the best option for us. However there isn't much near this hotel as it is in the business district. It's only a ten minute walk to areas with a lot of food and bars and so on. Rooms were cleAn, had all the facilities. The top floors had laundry and pretty nice hot pool facilities. Stayed at the club room with lounge access. Rooms are clean and spacious, has a view of the river and feels serene. Service is great and staff speaks English. It's a bit of a walk to train stations but there's a shuttle bus that brings you to Osaka station. Hotel is also just located beside art and science museums. There's also a sky bar called 40 sky bar nearby. Lounge has a good night view and there's free flow of beer and wine in the evening. Tidbits Coffee and tea is free all day at the lounge. Coin Laundry machine also available at the lounge floor. Breakfast is nice and has variety of cuisines. Smoking room is beside the restaurant. We enjoyed the 3night stay. The room size is good for two people. If you dont want to use the hot bath with other people on 16th floor which is clean and well furnished, there is a Japanese style bath tub in the room. Our room has lounge access so we got to enjoy the free drink and snack as you can see from other reviews. The only problem I have is that I could never get the coffee from the coffee machine in the morning in the lounge. Not sure if I didnt know how to operate the machine or it was not working. We also got to use the laundry room no need to add the detergent. Just remember only add the time of drying that is necessary. The machine does not allow to cancel the operation until the time of your choice is done. If you are traveling from KIX airport, I suggest that you take limousine bus to OSAKA station 2nd stop. Then walk one minute to JR Sakurabashiguchi Exit to take hotel shuttle bus. Its free and only a 1015 minutes ride. The shuttle bus schedule and pickup location can be found on the hotel website. Overall, we recommend this hotel. We will stay here again if we come back to OSAKA!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Hotel Raizan North,"1-chōme-3-3 Taishi, Nishinari Ward, Osaka, 557-0002, Japan",3.9,34.648424,135.5041264,"For the price, you cannot complain. The room was clean, big enough for our needs. The public baths were nice, with a hot bath that was super relaxing after a long day of walking.

The atmosphere in the common room is great, with people minding their own business and often doing different activities.

Was actually one of my favorites in the big cities in Japan! This place is okay if u really want cheap and have your own room. The women's toilet on 5th floor had newish sink and toilet bowl. The women's shower on 1st floor was functional but looked like one you wud expect in an akiya. But the men's shower was under reno, so maybe they will get round to reno the ladies shower too. However, I wont stay here again cos the comforter blanky has bed bugs, i cud feel creepy crawlies when I slept with it last nite, and in the morning i had 2 bites on my right arm. The place is like a cross between an old business hotel and a hostel. Good location n cheap. There's no English channel that works on TV despite the description saying so. Honestly you get what you pay for room wise. But the amenities and cost more than make up for it.

Pros.

English speaking staff friendly
Sauna
Bath
Self help food
AC
WiFi
Free bicycle rental
Free room cleaning if staying more than three days

Cons

Odd smell
Old furniture

It's cost effective, I'd visit again. Very convenient location, very cheap. Own bathhouse open late, showers and toilets business hotel typical not in the room, but clean and modern facilities. Very helpful 247 front desk, free bycicle rent!!
Room was very small, but enough for a solo traveler. Nice Tatami, window could be open, and it was pretty quite. The fact that they call this a hotel is laughable. Its a hostel and a dirty old one at that. The comforters were stained, the measly 4 private showers were filthy, the elevators  hallways smelled like an ashtray, and the kitchen had dried ramen noodles on the counter. They get an two stars as the front desk staff was very nice and the location was very close to the subway. But Id never stay here again.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Staff is friendly but English is limited and frontdesk procedures,like changing rooms, are slow, checkout is fast though automated.
Limited breakfast choice in restaurant next door  6 set menues I say limited because I only like 2 of them.
Rooms are small, ok for 1 person but you'll have a hard time fitting 2 big suitcases in there. The rooms with 2 single beds, though bigger, have even less usable floorspace.
Good shower and amenities you can pick more up on ground floor at the elevator.
Everything looks very clean but when I moved the sofa I found they had not vacuumed underneath. Not a big deal but could have been better. We had a nonsmoking room but it someone had obviously worked hard to to give themselves longcancer. Hence we requested and were givenanother room. I was staying there between 3 to 4 Apr, due to my old mother I had to book another day before our late night flight the next day. Due to miscommunication with my local counterpart, I extend my current room at a high price the night before. But after discussing with the hotel front desk, a very nice and efficient Vietnamese lady Ms. Thuy who could speak fluent Japanese helped me to switch to a lower cost room that I needed and helping to translate my English communication readily. She was calm and friendly and most importantly patience with me. She understands for just booking a few hours I don't need a high category room. I really wanted to thank her for her kind and wonderful assistance! Besides this, the quality of the hotel is wonderful! The bathroom amenities has a good selection using high end and comprehensive facial oilwash and lotion. They even have a hair iron thong! Location is central to good and all purpose shops like the equivalent of 7 eleven. The lobby is beautiful decorated with Sakuras and the architecture of the lobby is natural wood carvings, with nice furnishings. Definitely a nice boutique hotel to stay! Don't miss it! I enjoyed the service of several of the ladies at the front desk and the staff all use translators which makes it a bit stressful when trying to communicate. Would be good if their english was better.

I like that they will greet when visitors enter and the ones I met provided good and sincere service. They also have different front desk staff daily.

Convenient location near sakaisuji hommachi station, the nearest exit is 15 with the lift if I remember correctly.
The station is quite big and there is more than 1 line there but I love that it is not a busy station.

There are a few cafes nearby and several very small local restaurants so there are not a lot of choices in my opinion but you can always take the subway elsewhere to eat since its convenient.

There is a 711, lawson and family mart within walking distance nearby and also a drugstore mini mart down the street

There is a different wifi for each room which is a little troublesome but they have good security for the rooms.

For eg When I forgot my keycard in the room and asked for another one, I had to write my keycode that I set when I checked in to verify its my room.

Double standard room type's washroom is different from the smaller room as the sink is seperate and outside of the toilet room and shower room.
So when someone is using the sink, you can hear the sink sound wherever you are in the room.

And good to bring a smaller power outlet not the bulky multi usage kind as mine was too bulky to be plugged in to the outlet next to my bed. They also provide a charger for type C and lightning!

The toilet bowl heats up and the facilities in the room are not old and gorgeous, gives a luxury feel. They also have a hair iron

My humifidier's water level was low and the cleaner didn't top it up so I called the front desk and she came up. She helped me to remove the water tank and showed me how much water to put in but didnt change it for me.

The aesthetics in the lobby was so beautiful with fake sakuras during sakura season and comfortable, but too quiet as there is no background music haha.

I think overall they provide better service and better amenities than other 3 star hotels I have stayed in Osaka and Tokyo.
This felt more like a 4 star hotel!

It was a pleasant stay and I'll consider staying there again! Was 1.5 hours early before check in time 3pm and they wanted to charge 2000 yen for early check in. Room had a funky smell. Location is not really close to anything. The subway requires a bit of a walk Great price and value combination. Very modern and clean. The only issue is the bathroom design with the only sink inside of the main room. It's okay if you are alone in the room, but weird if not. Yet the hotel is overall recommended still.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Checking out was easy and quick using the smartphone so that I liked. The hotel room was spacious and clean and had all necessities that I needed. Room was OK for what it was. Looked kinda oddly put together and patched. Beds weren't really comfortable ans had a stain. However I forgot a towel there and the hotel was kind enough to keep it. Even Offered to ship it. Honestly for the night I stayed there it was perfect. Spacious rooms, but beds are very uncomfortable. You can feel the springs in the bed, and they could not provide additional blankets and  or pillows, even when we offered to pay. The location is relatively close to juso station but in the middle of the red light district. Women and men stand on the corner most nights. Rooms did have damage, such a holes in the wall covered by tape. Actually one of the best hotels in osaka and great location. Only issue is the specific street it's on does have a few uhh night.. 18 places.. but it's outta the way so it's fine to go with family. Pretty good and clean place. Nice bathroom pretty good kitchen though don't plan on doing heavy cooking in it. 2 convenience stores less then 5min walk away with a Japanese style super market also close by. It is next to the night life section but it's not to bad. Room I had had no washer for clothes. Not sure if it's some or all units, but if like mine you would need to go off site. Room also had a smartphone you could borrow for info, GPS, calling for free, even internationally witch I thought was very useful.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The staff is very helpful and they have free activities everyday. The rooms are very clean and were a good size. The hotel is very well located in Shinsaibashi, an 8 minute walk to Dotunbori. There are several good food options nearby. I'll definitely stay here if I come back to Osaka. This was my favorite stay during my Japan trip and I will definitely book this hotel again the next time I am in Osaka.

The staff was super friendly and helpful, they answered every question I had patiently. They also helped me fill out the luggage transfer forms a day before I actually needed to ship my luggage. Little things like that went a long way for me during my first trip to Japan. While this isnt mandatory, every staff member spoke English impeccably.

The room is a good size and the bed was very comfortable. The massage chairs, happy hour drinks, and generous rentals they offer are also all awesome as well!

Like I said, this is one hotel that I will definitely book again the next time I visit Japan! Room is clean and well kept! Was also pleasantly surprised that the doublebedded room was rather spacious, perfect for small families! Would definitely come back whenever I visit Osaka again.

Wonderful service staff as well!

ja ne, The Bridge OSAKA! First the location is great, however the rooms are tiny. With really hard beds.  And there are a LOT of children running around the hotel constantly. The have free ice cream daily, free beer every evening, and free ramen.  These things actually pulled the roomshotel from a 2 to a 3.  However, the room was so small with such an uncomfortable bed I can not recommend staying here. We had a lovely stay at The Bridge Hotel. The area is largely made up of vintage stores and restaurants. It comes alive at night, though you can't hear anything from the hotel. Only a short walk to Dotonbori and multiple stations.
Breakfast was good, offering a new dish each morning. There was sausage, bacon and egg, fish, pastries, bread, cereal, soup, rice, and a few other items. The tea, coffee, and soft drinks were available 24 hours. There was an event on each day, free alcohol, ramen and ice cream between 15002130. It can get a little busy at meal times. There is a laundry and smoking room on the 12th floor alongside a small roof seating area.
The room was spacious and clean. We decided not to have our room cleaned daily, but we were given fresh towels and bottled water.
The staff were lovely. They greeted us as we entered. Checkin was quick, and we were talked through the events, breakfast, WIFI, etc. We would definitely stay again",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Our only complain was the check in and check out time. The check in is 4 pm and check out time is 10 am. We were forced to sign agreement that if we check out after 10 am, they will charge 1.500 yen per hour. Talk about inhospitality. It's close enough to Dotonbori shopping street , you can walk your way to it . It sits right next to Dotonbori river , though further downstream . The rooms are extremely small even for small stature couple with 2 big and 2 small luggage . Extremely welcoming front desk staff especially the lady with the glasses. A generous buffet breakfast and affordable room rate makes this a great stop in our journey. WARNING READ THIS FIRST BEFORE GOING TO THIS HOTEL

THEY ARE THIEVES

Everything was good and dandy with this hotel but they will steal your belongings. Heed my words, Ive been to lots of Japanese hotels and they usually are very friendly and accommodating with items that you forgot inside your room after checkout. They will usually even call you and ship it to you if they find something that you forgot. But this hotel stole some of our items. We were 100 sure we left the items there and kept calling them, but they keep denying that they saw something which means the staff or someone that works there stole it.

Some of the guests there when asking for room service also reported similar things so I dont recommend this hotel at all.

If you really need to stay here and have no other choice, be sure to take everything with you when you leave unless you want something of value stolen.

Its sad because The hotel is at a very nice spot and location where you can access lots of nearby attractions.

The rooms are not the best but they will suffice.

Just find another one I warned you. Pros  very convenient location, powerful shower and a decent breakfast.
Cons  check in time is 4pm, this is very late considering check out is 10am in the morning. Good location in Osaka near metro station and walkable distance to most things in the area. Good AC rooms were clean too","Monday: Open 24 hours

We booked a room for two adults and one child, but the queensized bed was only suitable for the adults, leaving no arrangements for our child.

My wife is in her third trimester of pregnancy, and the lack of a suitable sleeping arrangement was especially concerning.

We requested a bed or mattress for our child, but were told this was not possible, and there was no willingness to help from the staff.

They offered a babybed for the next day, but we needed immediate assistance.

We reluctantly agreed to wait until the next day for a solution for our child, only to receive a call half an hour later informing us that we would need to pay for the item. While it's understandable to charge for extra services, given the context of our situation, it reflects extremely poor judgment and indicates that this hotel does not operate at a high standard. Such a lack of consideration for families in need of basic accommodations is disappointing and further underscores our dissatisfaction with this experience.

This lack of support does not reflect the standard expected from such a hotel.

One had to sleep on the floor!

I would not recommend booking for three people under these conditions. Ideal spot if you intend to visit the super highend stores around the hotel. Hotel lobby is on the 16th floor. Room was standard in size but of course very clean, as expected. The amenities are nice that I didnt need to take mine out and use the hotels instead. They also provide pyjamas that are nice to sleep in. Receptionist H.Dan is the most wonderful person we have ever met. She guided us very enthusiastically, specifically in both English and Japanese extremely fluently, with a very good accent. If you come to Osaka, you should try this hotel, beautiful view, good service, acceptable price. A truly interesting trip. Great location, beautiful hotel  view, this hotel could easily become 5 stars hotel, good room size, and clean room, grate room service and cleaning with all you might need. Close to most attraction area, near grate restaurant and shopping 2 min walk to nearest underground station Hommachi station, the only less nice thing I can say is limited buttle of water per day 1 per person and as well the available instant coffee.
Otherwise the front dest service were good and well spoken in English no need of a translation app. Grate hotel for the value. This is our fifth hotel on this trip to Japan, and I would say it was our least favorite among the 4 and 5star hotels.  I will compare this only with other 4star hotels.to be fair

Pros
1. Close to Hommachi Train Station It's only a 3minute walk, making it convenient for traveling through trains.
2. Alcohol Vending Machine Available on the floor.
3. Close to Semba Shinsaibashisuji Shopping Street Easy access to shopping.
4. Inexpensive budget friendly hotel

Cons
Breakfast
I recently stayed for three nights, and unfortunately, the breakfast experience was a disaster. Out of the three mornings, two were particularly bad. On the last dayJune182024, the situation was chaotic. There were not enough seats for guests, and we had to wait for an empty table. We arrived at 830 AM and finally got seated at 900 AM, with the last order being at 930 AM. By then, 18 people were waiting behind us.

What frustrated me the most was the behavior of the staff. Two male employees were consistently rude and dismissive. When we asked them questions, they brushed us off and preferred to chat with other employees instead.
a blackhaired male staff member was incredibly rude when we handed him our breakfast coupons at the beginningbefore waiting line disaster thing start When I asked him nicely about the situation, he continued to chase us away. And dont tell us anything! Just order us to stay outside! Omg 

Additionally, A male guest who had stepped out to use the restroom faced unnecessary rudeness from an older whitehaired staff member upon his return, despite his wife and kids still being at the table. The situation escalated, and the guest was told to stay outside. Then, this staff member turned to us and yelled for our coupons, which was unnecessary behavior. He stormed to the table, put the sign on, and walked away. Other hotel staff usually tell you nicely that when you finish, just flip the sign so they can clean the table or just tell that this is your table! Im not sure what his problem was. I saw him on the first day breakfast too and hes actually aggressively the same good thing havent encountered him otherwise would ruin the whole staying

The only saving grace was one whitehaired female staff member who was always polite and explained the situation to waiting guests. She always greet all the customers with smiles even in rush situations those two shouldve learned from her

However, it didn't make up for the overall poor experience. When we left at 925 AM, there were still families waiting outside despite the last order being at 930 AM and closing at 1000 AM. It would make more sense to extend the breakfast hours to accommodate all guests properly or expand your dining area!

Dusty Room
The room was dusty see the picture, which aggravated my allergies.
Location
The hotel is too far from all the famous Osaka attractions. Be mindful that you will have to walk a lot, and there isn't much to do or see around the hotel.
Elevator System
The hotel has two separate elevators. One goes from the ground to the lobby on the 16th floor, and then you have to walk to the other end to take another elevator to your room rooms are on floors 5 to 15. This setup is inconvenient. Why is the lobby on the highest floor? If you just want a quick trip to the convenience store, you have to take the guest elevator UP to the 16th floor, walk to the other elevator, and then go DOWN from 16th to the ground floor.
Staffs
Among all the 4star hotels we've stayed in, this hotel's staff had the least proficiency in English. Not to be mean, but communication is important for a 4star up hotel, even though I understand English isn't the first language for many and I came from the country that English isnt my first language too but to work in the 4star hotel this should be a requirement
5. AC system  The temperature range of the AC in the room is 2035C, and its central air conditioning like other hotels. However, the 20C setting was really hot during the summer day.

We stayed about 1hr, it had nice calming music and a serene atmosphere. The food was alright, there were some cold options including mackerel, salmon and some  chicken flavoured dish that had the texture of shellfish. There were also some pastries, these were fine but nothing to write home about  slightly chewy and not the best quality.

For the hot food, there were some small fingersized hotdog style sausages as well as meatballs and some lukewarm yakisoba. This was okay, but I liked the Miso soup and mushroom soup best, and there is rice from a rice cooker as well.

As much filter coffee, tea and green tea as you like, but from irritatingly small cups. Good location, clean room ocndition. Nice staffs. Location is perfect, the staffs are friends and nice. However, the room is old and the bathroom has a sour smell bearable though. The unbearable thing is the sound proof. Since the wall are thin, we kept on hearing people talking or coughing outsidenextdoor. Won't be there again Stayed 2 nights. Location was convenient. Walls and carpets suggested the hotel was pretty old. Amenities were in the restrooms. Room was small. Overall average, but I think I will try somewhere else next time. The air con is automatic so, the fan doesn't always work. It will release air only from time to time after the temperature drop or go to centain point. So we couldn't really breath and thought the air con was broken. We found out later that all air con are the same for this hotel and we dont like it.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Capsule Inn Osaka,"9-5 Dōyamachō, Kita Ward, Osaka, 530-0027, Japan",3.8,34.7030229,135.5036535,"A relaxing stay. A real Japanese culture experience public bath, hot bath, sauna. An adult, male only stay where you can be comfortable with or without clothes on. Surrounded by busy nightlife establishments but very silent, relaxing, refreshing and peaceful place. If you like a traditional Japanese onsen and arent afraid of being naked with other guys, is the greatest capsule hotel of all time!

There are 8 hot tubs, pools, etc, plus multiple saunas and steam room, and even pools on the rooftop. Its incredible how affordable this place is for everything they give you. It cost me less then 30 USD for a place to sleep plus unlimited use of the onsen. Back in my home city this would cost at least 3x.

The sleeping capsule is also pretty good, although maybe the sound insulation could be better.

This place is also funny because you can tell a ton of young Japanese business men go here after a long day of work and sleep in the dry area for a few hours before returning to the office the next morning. Even though thats strange, I think it added to the charm of it all.

A experience all around. I would return no questions asked if I was back in Osaka and traveling alone again. It has a bath house frequented by the locals. The elevator is next to it so don't be shocked to see naked men passing you. With this, I think women are not allowed or should avoid this place you have been warned. Men are ok to book this. This review on foreigner view...

When you checkin its kinda takes time cus the staff is slow or quite detail to explain other customer cus this hotel is mix with public bath.

The staff barely speak English but the use translator device.

To put our big luggage put it beside the reseption and they will label our bag.

The room is on 3rd5th floor.

The one make me kind confused is to take a bath...
The 1st floor is bath area but on the 2nd floor also bath  shower area.

For those havent try naked together in bath.... Enjoy D
And please wash ur self before do bath.

Also this hotel provide everything like limitless kimonos,towels, soap etc.

The weird part for me is... Everyday i need to recheckin 
Sign the same paper

Location is perfect near station and food area Great experience. The staff speaks some English, so maybe should have some conversational Japanese skills. The baths were great, the services were plenty including massages, and meals. The actual capsule was a bit must but overall very clean. The capsule room has no lock on it so definitely use your locker. Is better to have less luggage to fit everything in the locker, but they can store away your luggage behind the counter if need be. Its a great place to just lounge and relax. The location sits in the heart of many amazing bars, affordable izakayas, and there are many tours spots near by. Its also very close to the station, maybe a 5 minute walk.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Decent albeit small room with good AC and at times slow wifi. The atmosphere felt somewhat unwelcoming despite beauty corner in the lobby given the fact that coffee machine could be accessed in the dining room just after 11.30 am unless one purchased breakfast ticket as part of allyoucandrink feature. Maybe one could swap one of the beauty mirror location that is in main lobby with the coffee machine? Also not sure iif the hotel cares about proper recycling of plastic bottles and so on  any trash separation did not seem to be taking place during daily cleaning routine at the corridor whereas ecofriendly statements at the toilet paper stand lead one to chase for toilet paper when running short of it... Very impressed with Vine Osaka. Very reasonable pricing less than 7000 yen for twin bed, has even free drink, great quality air purifier must have for me, no bad smell and corridor smells nice. Just a few minutes away from Kitahama Station. Modern and very nice staff as well. Definitely recommend. Stayed here for 2 nights and I liked this hotel. Great value for the price. Its 5 mins walk to the kitahama train station. Staffs are friendly and welcoming. The interior of the room looks new and modern. Has a humidifier. This hotel offers tea and coffee in the lounge which is great. The only downside is that the single room is tiny and its hard to open my suitcase fully. For a business trip to Kitahama. The location and price are just right because it is close to the famous Kitahama restaurant, convenience store at a reasonable price. The total rating is good. But the room size is a bit small if you are 2 people in a room.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
APA Hotel Osaka Tanimachi,"1-chōme-3-12 Uchihonmachi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 540-0026, Japan",3.5,34.68323,135.515503,"For a budget hotel, it has all the amenities you could want. I will, however warn anyone that books breakfast at the attached ""restaurant"" that it is not what you would expect a hotel breakfast buffet to be. The images portrayed on the inroom TV falsely advertise bacon, eggs, and other ""traditional"" breakfast items. The items on the buffet when I dined were a salad, beef balls, sausage links, Chinese soup, and curry. Not worth the 1500yen per person if you ask me.
You do not get to select the menu item that is also offered with breakfast. It comes to your table conveyor belt style and you can choose to either accept it or send it back. On our stay, it was a fried fish. Tasty but, left something to be desired. Advise to find breakfast elsewhere. Good value for the price. Comfortable rooms and more spacious than most business hotels in Japan. The staff was friendly, especially Asano, who gave us nightly food recommendations after hearing that we were looking for local spots, Very near Osaka castle. Perfect if you want a place to stroll, run, or relax while taking a break from touring the city. Place is clean but rooms can be a bit small so manage your expectations. Good hotel for the money. Rooms are very small and bathroom cramped so much so I had to reverse myself out. Still it was functional and water and accessories were great. I liked the simple Japanese breakfast. Room was clean but a bit dated with air con directly above in front of the bed. This is for my American friends. This is a great hotel. The staff are so nice. I love them. Kindly note that rooms are small. Thats normal for Japan, but if you are more voluminous and big and beautiful, do beware the bathrooms are dangerously small. Im small in stature and size and I found it hard to walk around the toilet to get to the tub. Wow. Just trust me. You will need to get a bigger room if you are big and beautiful. Theres just no way you can sit down on the toilet. None. And if you are really germaphobe like me, I hate touching the  surface of anything in the bathroom and because of the size of it, I have to be careful not to slip and watch where I am going, even turning my body angle wise. Other than these problems, its a nice hotel. Close to Osaka castle. Great staff. Its a budget hotel that worked for 2 nights, and I was not super sad to leave this hotel.","Monday: Open 24 hours

3 minutes walk from ShinOsaka Station! Convenient hotel for business trips and travel

Via Inn ShinOsaka is a hotel in a convenient location, just a 3minute walk from the east exit of ShinOsaka Station. Even if you come to Osaka from the region by Shinkansen, it is very convenient to access as you can just get off the station.


This time I stayed in a standard single room. You can take the necessary amenities with you at the front desk on the 1st floor, so you can take as many as you need.
The room is equipped with a pot, tea cup, refrigerator, 3 hangers, deodorant spray, etc. to make your stay comfortable.


Breakfast can be eaten on the 1st floor for an additional 880 yen. We have a menu centered on Japanese and Western food, so you can be sure to replenish your nutrition from the morning.


There are convenience stores such as Family Mart near the hotel, and there are many restaurants within ShinOsaka Station. However, many restaurants close around 10pm, so be careful when eating late at night.


Although there are no particularly noteworthy facilities, it has the minimum necessary items and is fully equipped with the functions necessary for a business trip or vacation.


Via Inn ShinOsaka is a very convenient hotel if you want to get around from ShinOsaka Station. It's close to the station, has everything you need, and allows you to spend a comfortable time.


3 minutes walk from ShinOsaka Station
Equipped with the minimum necessary equipment
Breakfast is fulfilling
Convenience stores and restaurants nearby Good service, near jr shin osaka, clean and walkable from station We stayed at the VIA Inn for 4 days as we had a lot to do in Osaka. The staff was very kind, the location couldn't be better as it is a simple 2 minute walk around the corner to ShinOsaka station, and the breakfast service was good with a change in the menu every morning. We originally were supposed to stay for 2, but had a change of plans and the staff was more than willing to accommodate us in adding 2 additional days at the very last minute. Though the building offers ""small rooms"" compared to western standards, we had no issues with them. The only complaint I could give was that the AC system is an older style which they leave turned off in cooler months and turn on in the warmer ones. This left us sleeping with the window open at night, but at this time of year it was plenty cool enough to be comfortable. Also I'd recommend bringing a second pillow as the ones provided are very, very, stiff. Those two things are the only reasons I decided to give 4 stars instead of 5. Beyond that, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a place to sleep at night and get cleaned up before packing up and traveling around for the day. This a nice small hotel within a walking distance to Shin Osaka station. Price is reasonable. However the size of the room is really small. The breakfast is served between 630 to 930 and is included in the room price. I appraciated the quality and variety of the breads. One bad point is that check out is at 10 am. rooms were very clean and modern, the bed was comfortable. The service was 1010 and very welcoming...location was 1010 just 5 mins from the station","Monday: Open 24 hours

First of all, this hotel is a 4star one. They claim to be, but expectations are not met. the WIFI is bad
The rooms are not cleaned properly, and I ended up with bug bites on my body. You can see stains from bed bugs on the blanket. We informed the staff, but they did nothing except change the blanket. We also asked for the room to be checked, which they did, but I still woke up the next morning with more bug bites. Can see pictures, i had several but only post those
The air conditioning in the room was not working properly either. Every day we had to wait outside for the room to cool down because it was TOO hot, impossible to stay inside. Im not sure about the ventilation, but I think its bad.
Not as good as we expected for a 4stars hotel experience there. The location is good, but I dont think I would recommend this hotel Rooms were big enough. Cleanliness was not good. There was a lot of dirt under the beds and the mattress protectors were not really clean. Daily cleaning was inadequate. Staff were not particularly friendly. Of the various hotels on our trip to Japan, this was by far the worst. About a 9 minute walk to the nearest subway station. This place is no good for stay .  Walk out buy some also abit far and no place can walk walk . Customer Service bad ! Staff no Smile ! Breakfast no nice daily morning must is same .....asking 1 Water Staff counter Mr Bishwas say need to pay !!! 1 day only 2 bottle  ! Omg ! I just need 1 only need me go far away buy ! Room need anything also need go out side the level 1 take ......this hotel for me is only can give 2 stars below bad bad  Loved my room. Staff was amazing and Loved the location. The room was big and clean...the cleaning staff was so quiet...they never made noise while working ! In fact I never heard any noise in the hotel. The area is in Korea town and very very charming !!!!! I am absolutely glad that I picked this Hotel. The Hotel has a Luxury feel to it and looks better in reality than in the Pictures online.   Very happy with my choice!!! Was very happy with how clean and pleasant the room was for the price. Usually I have awful experiences with Osaka hotels. This time I was quite happy! No noise issues, no mess, plenty of space. The location wasnt the best for what I needed, but it was worth it to travel a bit out of the way to be more comfy.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Bathroom was also very nice. Hotel staff was very polite and helpful. Hotel is directly next to metro station and grocery stores. Laundry is possible at the hotel.

One star deducted because charging phone or power bank is not possible while not in the room  i stayed 1 month and have almost no  complaint. perfect location, great access to public transportations, pretty much quiet but the staff is not always very flexible when you need help. Yokohama offers a way higher level of service  but will still come back as it is 95 perfect  They ignored cleaning my room twice when I had left the clean room sign on the door. 2 days in a row. I even took a photo next morning before I left to show a time stamp of what time I left it there.
They were cleaning rooms on either side of me when I left it there...
I added 1 extra day the first day and paid at the counter. The gentleman told me breakfast was included only to find out from different staff on that morning that it was apparently not included.
Rooms are overly small.

I ask to speak to the manager in the morning before I left and she told me the manager wasn't there what kind of business doesn't have a manager in case of an issue Very busy, extremely overpriced hotel.
Worst service in a hotel in Japan during my 2 week stay.
Rooms are tiny and not very well cleaned. My robe had a stain on it and a towel had some hair in it too.
No staircase and bad smell of the chlorine in the whole hotel.
Lobby always full of people and the service is not as polite as in other hotels i stayed in.
Plus for the good location but i was happy j managed to cancel my booking and just stay for one night. I stayed there for a night and it was a nice cozy and luxurious experience. It is high tech, they made us do selfchecking digitally which was surprising and also the lift access was through room key cards and each room was given with 2 key cards for convenience which was best.

Super convenient as Aeon Food Style and McD just below the hotel. We arrived at 215pm but was only told that we could check in at 3pm. However at 245pm, one of the receptionists told us that we could check in already. Hence, the check in process was a little misguided. However, it was a clean stay! Amenities were provided just like other hotels in Osaka and Japan. The location is quite convenient to arrive. Its near to the exit 2 of Yotsubashi metro station. Besides that, Aeon Food and McDonald are located underneath this hotel, so you can easily find something to consume nearby. Id recommend my friends to stay while visiting Osaka again. Standard of JR inn group that not to small room and clean with window and controllable ACheater.
Amenities just enough but located in front of lift. Waiting for lift is quick and quiet.
Aeon Fresh food supermarket 24 hours located under the hotel.
Walkable from shinsaibashi about 5 minutes A lot of charging ports, bright room with several warm spotlights

Storage lockers are very convenient but can be used by the public too as they do not check.
It is used frequently so do store it when you arrive.

Location is central and convenient, nearest station exit is exit 2 yotsubashi station but do note there is no lift at that exit
Its 1 stop from Namba near dotonbori!

Aeon supermarket and mcdonalds are along the same street.  There are a few nice cafes nearby.

I stayed for 1 night and paid 200 yen for tax accomodation fee lower than another 3 star hotel I stayed in Tokyo which some Osaka hotels require upon check in.

Their buffet breakfast last order is 9.30am which is a little early for me, went for breakfast at around 9.15am on a saturday and they stopped topping up food by then.
Some dishes had very little left like the steamed fish and udon bowls so do take note. 

The lobby has few seats which can be easily taken up before check in time at 3pm, so you can also sit at Aeon supermarket next door or you can try mcdonalds along the same street.

The 1st floor of the building is quite spacious for meeting and has a heater which is nice.

Aeon supermarket next door has thermo flasks that you can use to fill your bottle if you need hot water as well !

Service at front desk can be better and more welcoming such as when guests enter as we will walk past the front desk to the lift.

Overall it was decent! Here is perfect place to stay for traveler. Cozy bed and awesome bathroom. Highly recommend and prepare translation app for fast communication at reception. ","Monday: Open 24 hours

Unfortunately it was not up to par. The rooms were fine, big bathroom and roomy. The issue was the cleanliness. I had booked 2 rooms. In my room, I attached a picture of the pillow, it had weird stains and looked like mold? The other room, my friend had a weird yellow stain on her bed sheet and duvet. We did ask for a new sheet and duvet, that was delivered to us. The staff at reception were nice and so was the location. But the hallways seemed to be pretty dirty. This is a place I would not stay again. The rooms are outdated and need to be updated with the times but what we didn't like was the musky smell of the room. It's disgusting. Maybe it's the carpet because of the humidity becausewe noticed that everytime you leave you have to pull the key from the wall and then the AC isn't working much while you are gone. Besides that, the front staff were efficient and friendly.  The location is unbeatable beside everything you want to see and convenience stores, etc.  The location is the selling point of this hotel. There is no way that this is a 3 star hotel. Its old, dirty, and super moldy. The curtains smelled like cigarette smoke probably baked in from decades of use. Front desk staff are pretty rude as well and dont seem well informed at all.

I am a Platinum Elite IHG member but my experience here was so bad that Im put off of IHG properties for life. I will not be working on keeping my status for the upcoming year  We are close to everything. Its so easy to travel in Osaka when you stay in this hotel.

The staff was so helpful. We lost one passeport and the reception called the train station for us and the previous hotel where we stayed. The staff helped us to go to the police station and helped us to translate to the officers. I cant imagine how it would have ended without their help. We finally found it thanks to them .
Thank you so much again.

We enjoyed every day in this hotel. The hotel had professional and friendly staff. I asked for a recommended restaurant, and it turned out to be one of our favorites of the trip. The rooms were always clean, and the location is very close to shopping and lots of restaurants. A small downside is that it's a good 9minute walk to the train station, so we had to take a cab sometimes.

Great location, abt 15 mins walk to tennoji Station, slightly uphill. On the opposite direction, you can walk to ShinSeKai, Namba or Dotonbori straight up the main road. Surrounded by lots of shopping  eateries.

Check in is 4pm which is quite late in our experience. You can check in before 4pm but you can't access the room. They provide free lockers for you to store your luggages so you can roam until 4pm or later to get to the rooms. The room is more spacious than many of the hotels in big city in Japan. We had a king bed room. The bed  pillows were harder than we like but the room was clean  quiet with blackout curtains.

Free hot breakfast ends at 9am. Rice, soup, eggs. vege, small pastries are available. Many amenities are on the ground floor such as green tea saches, toothbrushes  skin cares!

Staff has some English, polite  attentive. Not gonna lie. I was shocked at how big my room is for the price i paid.

The front desk service was tip top. They really dont mind helping me doing the self check in.

They have the coin laundry service.

The location is very near to the shin imamiya station.

I will surely book this hotel again if i come to Osaka again. The facilities are very good but the service is terrible with the people at the reception who are not friendly at all. Very excellent value. Rooms are a bit small, probably it's normal for Japan, but neat and tidy. Room cleaning is every 3 days but new towels are delivered daily. Complimentary hot breakfast here is so good that I look forward to it starting my day and consists of several types of soup, rice, salad, and a rotating variety of Asian hot items that could include egg, tofu, fish, meatballs, chicken, radish, bamboo shoots, etc plus coffee, tea, pastries.

Centrally located about 7 min walk between Tennoji station and DobutsuenMae station. A train runs directly behind the hotel but I barely notice it because it's just a quick low rumble. Has coin laundry washing machines and dryer. WiFi service only works in your room. Would definitely stay here again.

Service, dont expect anything.

Room, small size for 2 persons. Stains on carpet, dark walkway, dirty toilet. Design of the toilet needed 1 big step to go up and it easily trap ur step when getting down from the toilet.

By the way, the room come with 1 thin pillow for one person, if u are fine with it. Lucky to have the room with window with sunlight.

One good thing, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel is big bottle size available in the toilet, other items are refillable self service at level 2.

Coin laundry machine available at level 7, clean and dry service are separated in different machine.

Very budget hotel I would recommend for anyone, watch out the price as u could have a lot better option with that same price if u are booking early in Osaka.

Thank god Ive left, will not consider this hotel next time.

Highly recommend the hotel owner to consider upgrade the place. I and my sibling stayed for 2 nights. Walked in, confronted by a rude front desk lady who kept interrupting us, had no sense of personal space. When we asked if it was possible to do a late checkout she rolled her eyes and cut our sentences short yet AGAIN. Extremely rude. Room is clean but has many problems. Firstly, bathroom is tiny even considering it in Japanese dimension and does not drain water properly just using the shower will make the mat and floor soaking wet, even though we always kept the curtain shut tight. Secondly, sound isolation is horrible. On the 2nd day, after a long day of walking and sightseeing, we couldn't ask for more than a relaxing night. However, we had to endure our night with the next door making a scene... It was traumatizing. Sure, it's not the hotel's fault but we would've appreciated a better soundproof environment or a headsup on the quality. Lastly, the elevator was a pain in the neck especially during the ""rush hour"" for checking out. You can end up waiting forever or be late for checking out. Fortunately the checkout process was simple so we didn't have to fall for the penalty. In conclusion, never choose a hotel just for its location! One Five Osaka Sakaisuji is a fantastic place to stay, offering a great location that's both convenient and accessible. The hotel looks just like the photos, which is always a pleasant surprise. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, going out of their way to make sure guests have a comfortable stay. On top of that, the pricing is reasonable, making it an excellent value for what you get. Overall, it's a great choice for anyone visiting Osaka. Please do not even consider this hotel. The person in the front desk has no customer service  at all. As soon as I open the my rooms door, there is a very strong urine smell. The window cant open, so it means that I have to intolerance the smell for 4 days the bath is small and dirty. Old and stuffy hotel. The rooms are small and dusty, the bathroom have a dangerous step to access them. There is very visible mold in the bathroom and stains in the bathtub. It is a medium walk to the closest public transport stop.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Shuttle was difficult to find,  ended up getting a taxi about 2500 yen there,  then shuttle on the way back.  They stopped at all 3 terminals.  I would recommend calling ahead to get specific details on shuttle location,  they run every 30 minutes or so during the day. They have a fun lounge area with ping pong table, and a great walking path just outside.  Try the shortcake! Breakfast is not included but it was a great selection for 2400 yen. Toiletries  available.  Nice views of the airport. Room was perfectly clean and adequate for two people.  Plenty of toiletries provided.  Friendly and polite staff.  Coinop laundry is a plus.  Buffet downstairs is excellent. I don't know what the other users are talking about with cigarette smellwe didn't smell anything like that. The internet is very slow!

Location wise it's ok. Near convenience store and at the back is a very long road fill with bars and places to eat. There is a coin laundry in my room's floor though only 1 but not sure for other floors. The reception rejected my request for early check in, even though only 10 minutes earlier. She said nedd to wait till 3 PM to check in. You can't complain about this hotel, especially at such an affordable price. Yes, the rooms are a bit small, but honestly you're in Japan. You shouldn't be spending much time in the room anyway. We didn't have much luggage with us so space wasn't an issue. I also really enjoyed the size of the bathroom. It was nice to have a bath after a long day. Very close to several convenience stores and a short walk to the major train station. Very easy for them to hold our bags when we arrived prior to checkin as well as after we checked out before our train back to Tokyo. If you love smoking or dont mind the smell, then this place is for you. For my last week in Japan this wasnt how I wanted to spend it. There was no ventilation, we were told to just open the window. I asked the lady at the front desk a question but when I asked her to repeat herself for clarification I was made to feel like she had said a snarky comment to her other workers. She may not have.. but it was the timing and it made me feel uncomfortable which, as a guest I shouldnt feel that way.
The room we were in had a stain vertically on the wall and overall was a very unpleasant visit. We didnt end up staying and left. Found a different hotel. I wouldnt recommend staying.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Recommended! In the beginning the online chat was helpful in my queries around being tattooed and using the onsen. However when we got there the service was average if that in explaining anything to do with the rooms, cleaning and even the use of the onsen. You do need to pay a fee of roughly 150 per night for onsen use.The rooms were not bad ,clean tidy However small even for a double bed,and a tare in the wallpaper above the bed. No room to put suitcases for traveller's.
No English explanation anywhere in the hotel info folder .
We had to use Google lens to translate about the onsen. Only information about cleaning was that you needed to put a tag out if you wanted cleaning. Which there was no tag around.
We enquired at reception and we're told we needed to pay for cleaning services if we wanted it, which I thought was ridiculous seeing as we were booked for 4 days and 3 nights.

You had to exchange towels and washers down at reception each day if you wanted clean ones and the hallway was always FREEZING. They had heating capabilities, they were just not on.
The heating in the room was difficult aswell, always seemed to be ether to stuffy or a draft on the floor.

The website we booked through and their information did not say anything about cleaning fee, it did say there was breakfast option onsite However the Cafe that is attached to it was never open to allow that.

The good things was the onsen avaliablity and being allowed to use even with tattoos . This was the highlight of the stay here.  Location was really good, close to temma station and short 12 minute walk to Osaka station and all its surroundings. There was a lovely lady from Napoli on the staff that was one enough to help into my room when I was unable to get in my partner was still in the onsen with our room card.
There was small fridge ,kettle and microwave which was helpful and we were close floor to the onsen. It wasn't to cheap or expensive for the time there for 2 adults However the other places have been roughly same cost and didn't have extra fees for cleaning or onsen use.

Overall if you want a place that has an onsen and you have tattooes I would recommend However there are other places if you look that does and you'd probably get better service..

Such a shame  the cleaning is what got me.  Mediocre hotel. Theyll ask you to pay for a tax when you arrive even if youre not going to use the hot spring which is very unreasonable. They are not flexible at all with late check out not even 30 minutes. The location is a 14 minute walk to the closest major train station and good food. Very clean hotel with private hot springs onsen on top of the building! Rooms are a little small for western travelers but normal for Japan, and only a few minutes away from gay bars and karaoke Room was small and dirty. Dirty microwave, bathroom floor, dust in the room. Semidouble bed for 2 people not comfortable.

There are many major department stores close by. The facilities in the hotel are very new and clean. The free hot water bath in the hotel is a bonus after a whole day of walking and sightseeing. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and the service has been excellent. The breakfast was mainly Japanese style cuisine, and it was fresh and delicious. We really enjoyed our stay and we will definitely recommend the hotel to our friends and family. Fabulous hotel, with very kind, polite and professional staff. The location is absolutely fantastic, just outside the doors of the hotel are many restaurants and shopsstores. All in a covered area, so rain would never be an issue, there is a ""7 Eleven"" directly across from the hotel as well. Air conditioning in room was excellent. Highly recommend this hotel. This hotel is located close to Osaka Station Central and Metro Station. It is in a active charming neighbourhood. Rooms are very spacious and good. Well Maintained and Clean. Staff is friendly. Restaurant provides nice unique breakfast spread with japanese cuisine options. They provide free hot stone spa. This is a very nice hotel with clean guest rooms and super friendly staffs. I am grateful to Ms. Takayama for her kindness and enthusiasm to assist the guests who lost the mobile phone in JR station during the stay in the hotel. This hotel will definitely be my only choice for next visit to Osaka. Great location with nearby subway routes in the centre of Osaka. Local shops and bars make it good for that.

We booked for 4 people but we received 3 small single beds. Despite multiple discussions, the hotel refused to accommodate our request for a fourth bed or an upgrade, even when we offered to pay the difference. This is not the standard of accommodation one expects in Osaka, and I plan to lodge a formal complaint with the relevant authorities upon my return home. This experience felt disappointing and unjust, and I hope the hotel addresses these issues promptly. Excellent Service and Location!
Highly Recommend!

We had a fantastic stay at the Namba Oriental Hotel. The service was exceptional! When we requested firmer pillows since we weren't used to the soft ones provided, they were delivered to our room promptly.

We were delighted to discover a complimentary lounge on level 4. It was the perfect place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel's location is also unbeatable  just a short walk less than 10 minutes to train stations.

One Minor Point  The only thing to note is that you need to change elevators at level 3 to reach the hotel lobby. The toilet paper seems to be rather thin too hope it can be improved.

Overall, we had a wonderful experience at the Namba Oriental Hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Osaka. This is the hotel I always stay at when I visit Osaka. Its location in the heart of Namba is very convenient. The hotel has a great atmosphere, clean and spacious rooms, and the prices are very reasonable, so I always get a great deal. I stayed at this hotel in March of this year, and the service was very satisfactory. The hotel is located in a good accessible location as OCAT is located within walking distance, and there are several markets around it, but there is no big problem with the sound insulation inside. However, due to the presence of this hotels in crowded markets, taxi access is not possible, and there are several Pachinko stores nearby, and there are not many streetlights, which can cause your safety issues. DO NOT STAY HERE!
Upon arrival, the room that they had given my partner and I was filthy, marks on the walls, moldgrime all through the showerbathroom, the carpets looked like they had NEVER been vacuumed or cleaned and to top it off dust was EVERYWHERE. The valance on the bed was disgusting and stained, it looked like it had never been changed. The ac vent had a layer of dust 10mm thick over it. I went and complained and said that this was not okay and they did manage to change our room but the second one was not much better. In the lobby there was a unique musty smell that smelt like they were trying to cover up the smell of old cigarette smoke. The hotel is in a dire need of a full overhaul, not to mention the ac that is advertised doesn't even work properly. The communal areas by the elevators was so dusty when my shoe touched the skirting board the dust came off and there was visible change in colour
Now for the good...the location is awesome but that's it.

Hotel staff were very friendly, helpful, and spoke good English. Location is a short 5 minute walk away from Juso station, and there are bus stations nearby that take you to Osaka station in 10 minutes. Nice and spacious room, bathroom with shower and bath. All very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful, felt welcoming even when you don't speak Japanese well. My dress got ripped and they loaned me a sewing kit. FamilyMarket and Don Quijote around the corner are open 247 and the area felt safe. Juso station is a short walk away but if you want to see South Osaka you need to switch train providers and buy different tickets at multiple stations. Staff will go above and beyond to help you with your journey. very nice biz and tourist hotel a bit out of the way north of Yodogawa river park in a love hotel area  but this isnt a love hotel. spacious rooms, all clean and quiet with nice bedding, toilet and shower separate and a small TV, kettle, hair dryer fast wifi individual router for each room service is good!
nice
recommended! Have you ever seen a hotel that charges late check out fee for checking out five minutes late?
Well, this hotel demanded that I pay for a late check out for five minutes late and threathed to call police if I don't cooperate with their most absurd hotel rules that they failed to notify prior.

I never got any notification before that they will charge late check out fee by the hour and not a minute can be spared. The staff calls after the time deadline has passed to steal that extra money from you intentionally so you can be surprised by this new outrageous notice.

What's even funnier is the staff checks with the maintenance to see whether the information card about the fee is inside the room and voila! it isn't! Still they didn't even apologize for their mistake or their rude manners and even threathened to call police if I do not cooperate.
I wasnt even making any scene and was in the process of conversation and this extremity was their way of dealing with customers. I have never seen this level of hostility at a hotel.

After all, this is not a hotel you would expect at a regular hotel with hospitality and professionalism. The staffs were rude, laughing about this situation and talking back on customers. It is located where love hotels are and seems that this is a love hotel level, not a hotel. Also, the staffs speak no English and are imcompetent. They will take forever to do their tasks like simple changing of rooms due to foul smell in the room. Avoid at all costs! I stayed there 1 week double room.

For the price, its fine.

I wouldn't recommend it for families it is a sort of hybrid of a normal and a love hotel, located in a love hotel area. Not at all sketchy like Kabukicho though.

The good part is definitely the size of the room, with a real Japanese bath and separated toilets  shower room, and for once a real table with chairs!

Cleanliness wasn't the best stains here and there. The staff was very helpful, but although most of the time they aren't there.

The part that really annoyed me was that cleaning was provided only twice a week, on Friday and Monday ! And you have to ask for it with the door tag or they won't do it....!

The coin laundry was perfect. Lobby has a weight scale, drinks vending machine and microwaves.

It's a very strategic location since the Hankyuu Juso station will directly bring you to Umeda, Kobe and Kyoto !","Monday: Open 24 hours

I have read reviews from others before going and were a little comprehensive about their rooms.
However, this were all dispelled upon checking in.
But I have to agree that the room was crampy, especially if you have more than one luggage.
Nonetheless, the room and the bedsheets were clean surprise
I like the pillow. The firmness was just nice.
The bathroom was great, though a little low for my height.
Every equipment aircon control, light switches etc was in working condition.
They even have a multiports charger on the table for you to charge your phone.
Shopping centres, FB outlets and a huge modern transport station are all within walking distance from the hotel.
The buffet breakfast comes with two choices  Japanese or Western. You can try both if you want.
Staff were great and responsive.
My only negative feedback is the lack of English and Sports channels on TV.
In summary, one of the much better hotels that I have come across in my years of travelling.
But do note that they are closing down in January 2025 reasons not given
Cheers Old hotel that still gives physical keys. Small room with a musty smell. The bed was not clean and seemed like they forgot to change the sheets.
There is no control for the AC but only a small fan. The room was on the warm side.
Breakfast was okay and had numerous choices.
The bathroom was okay.
Great location near a major train station and shopping.
Friendly staff that allowed us to store our luggage when we arrived early. The rooms were quite compact and so small. It was difficult to manage with big luggage. However, the hotel was quite luxurious with all the amenities. It is very close to Osaka Station which makes it quite accessible. This hotel has a great history in the past but needs an urgent renovation nowadays. Location is the most attractive point some more just next to airport limousine bus stop. Easy to access from to Kansai Airport. Also next to Umeda station and shopping malls. Room is extremely small in size, its a problem to open or place your luggage. Other than facilities, they will make you the Japan Hospitality. Our bathroom smelled like pee everyday even after spraying scent stuff. Also bad view from the windows and the lighting is depressing looked better in the photos. Also the toilets are really loud for some reason but the ac works very well and the staff is averagely nice. Also the bathroom mirror is heated in the middle so it doesnt fog up after you shower and the toilet seats are heated. They still do physical room keys and not cards and they only provide one for each room even if you have multiple people so if you plan on splitting up they say you can leave the key with the front desk and whoever gets back first can go to the front desk and ask for it. Also there was a condom outside our window lol",no operation time,"lodging, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment"

There are many restaurants nearby, seven eleven next door. The room is clean, staffs are nice and helpful.  Me and kids love the portable massage. Thank you that makes our trip in Osaka memorable. The room is clean and tidy, especially love the mattress. The location is a bit far especially when you are commuting under the hot sun or with luggages. Overall the price is good enough for value. Good locationgood value. but I am not recommending the in room massage serviceI ordered body care coursebut the masseuse I got had no skill nor strength It was the first time I wish the massage could end sooner. It seems like you have to pick a crummy hotel in a great neighborhood or a great hotel in a crummy neighborhood. I am happy to say this is an excellent hotel in a very good location.

The room we're in the Annex is large for Japan  very welldesigned. The details are perfect there's a real shower, they drop off bottled water occasionally, there are extra toiletries  coffeetea packs in the lobby, the air conditioning is strong. You can check the status of the laundry room on your TV. Our room was absolutely quiet. The staff is terrific, especially our cleaning lady.

It's a tenminute walk from JR Osaka train station, which is a sevenminute subway ride to Namba the main tourist stop. For day trips, though, it's brilliant, with easy access to trains going to Kyoto, Himeji, Kobe, etc. Location not meant for senior citizens, walking to train station in rain , was very messy. Far away from the happening places like namba n dotonbori. Landed up using taxi most of the time .
Had an early flight , the hotel staff though polite couldnt manage to get me a taxi , however I managed to get one myself and landed up paying double the amount ..!
Will never stay in this hotel again .",no operation time,"lodging, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment"

Had an amazing shared kitchen that was very useful. Laundry room and kids play area.

Gym was free, which is great!

Staff were amazing, rooms clean and fresh, beds were comfortable. 100 stay again When booking I wasnt sure what to expect from this hotel but overall I was super happy. The service from the front desk from start to finish was great, they helped me to book my taxi transfer to the next stop. The location of the hotel is pretty much perfect. Its about a 10 minute walk to the main attractions and you have many things on your doorstep. There are about three convenient stores with them a one minute radius, as well as a very decent food hall next door. They have laundry facilities as well as a fun play area for small children. Helpful if they have jetlag.

Id recommend this hotel and definitely stay again if I was to visit the city. Rooms arent the most spacious, but theyre still decent. Skinny, as are most things in Japan. There is filtered water access on each floor, so if you dont fancy drinking mystery tap water you dont have to go to the convenience store though there is one right across the road.

The hotel is around 500 metres from nippombashi station and 300 metres from namba station, making railways easily accessible. There are also plenty of eating options nearby. Laundry facilities are provided, as are dining tables if you dont want to eat inside your room. Great location! Easy to find.. near train stations and walking distance to dotonburi.. room was great! Very clean and spacious.. staff members are polite and are able to understand English well.. toiletries, towels and pajama dresses are provided.. highly recommended! Loved this hotel. Rooms are big, clean and quiet. Beds are super comfy. They have a kids playroom. It's in a fantastic location  can easily walk to different stations and food areas. Reception is very helpful.

The location is convenient, it is close to 7Eleven and the train station. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Although the room is small, it is wellorganized for use. The hotel has friendly staff, a clean room, and is within walking distance of the Osaka Tower.
Limited space for more than one suitcase. Lovely hotel , short walk to subway and nice staff I stayed for 6 nights and 7 days and it was very clean and nice! The standard double room was large enough for two people, and although it was difficult to unfold the suitcase, it was reasonably spacious when folded. The front desk staff could speak English and were very friendly! We arrived early and asked if it was possible to leave our luggage in advance, and they informed us that it was possible. They also kindly explained the luggage storage and precheckin instructions. There is a laundromat on the first floor, but there are more people using it than expected, so if it is limited, there is a nearby 3minute walk away. The laundromat in is also good, so I recommend using it too! There is a 7Eleven about 5 minutes away and Tsutenkaku is about 10 minutes away, so it was very convenient to get to! I really recommend it

 Additionally, there is no separate water in the room, so I think you can use your personal tumbler or the cup in the room and use the water purifier on the first floor. This time during our stay, we just encountered that the water dispenser was out of water, and the only supplies we had were toothbrushes and tea bags.
No Qtips, shower caps or razors etc.

Very reasonable price to stay, recommend The rooms a bit old and small but clean and acceptable.

The hotels very near the station the elevator of the station to the hotel just about 100m. Super convenient and reasonable price. It's really close to the Shin Osaka train station.  Like, it's literally across the station, and you can see the sign from the train station.  The WiFi works great... In the lobby, but if you have a corner room like me, it's almost impossible to connect to, let alone keep a connection to.  The rooms are meant for business people that either couldn't catch the last train home, or people that really just want to be close to a train station for transit.  Also, the room consistently had a musty smell to it, so we had to open the window and leave it open for a while every day. Perfect if you plan to spend very little time there. As a 'base of operations' it served its purpose well, is very close to the Shin Osaka station providing access to Shinkansen, Osaka metro, and JR lines and was generally clean. Only fallback would be that the bathroom is a bit rickety and not designed for tall people such as myself.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Service  just the basics, but those were done ok, however, 

INCIDENT
I had a pair of expensive spare batteries for my camera placed on the table, recharged and ready to use, just went out to a coin laundry shop, then one hour later I returned. AFTER SERVICE WAS DONE ONE OF THOSE BATTERIES WENT MISSING what is strange. ALSO THE TOWEL THEY USED TO WIPE THE DUST WAS FORGOTTEN ON THE TABLE. However, after a long search under bed, behind fridgedesk, etc. I gave up and brought back the towel and asked the front desk how to handle this case, but yeah, you guess it nothing! So, a bit disappointed! Maybe there is still an offer for it?

All in all, 35 stars or 5 out of 10.
I could have recommended this hotel but only if this BATTERY CASE would have been investigated more seriously with an offer.

Thank you for having me 7 nights. scam alert  foreigners beware This hotel has listed itself on Agoda as a 4 hotel when its not. They claim Agoda sets the rating but that is completely untrue.

This is a 2 hotel and a bad one at that.Youll have to deal with the following
 Unclean  dusty and when I walked in the floor obviously hadnt been cleaned. The corridors and walls are filthy.
 Dispose your own garbage
 No housekeeping for under 4 night stays. I dont mind this policy if youre told about it in advance but it should be advertised at the time of booking.
 The worst is the paper thin walls combined with no carpet so sound travels insanely well. Youll get no sleep.

It has the distinction of being the only hotel I ever checked out of early to stay somewhere else, despite being out of pocket, in my life. That says it all. We are three people, and this is one of the best hotels I have booked in Osaka. The room is large, clean, and has four twin beds. Toiletries are available in the hallway. This hotel is very affordable, very comfortable, and easily accessible for everyone. I give negative comments so that Hotel can review and improve. The essential room 15 double bed is not suited for 2 person as the bed position is lean to wall make another person difficult to sleep well. Lack of wall hanger outside shower room to hang towels and lack of clothes hanger which 3 is only provided to the room and lack of storage cabinet, cabinet hanger and wall plug which is due to the layout position of room.

Bespoke Hotel Shinsaibashi,"Japan, 〒542-0081 Osaka, Chuo Ward, Minamisenba, 2-chōme−6−２５ ビスポークホテル心斎橋 1階",4.1,34.6765914,135.5047894,"The place looks nice walking in, it's kind of dark at the front desk. The staff were friendly and held our bags since we arrived early. I was concerned about the room as I read other posts after my girlfriend already booked the place. The room looks snazzy, for the price I could care less about how big it is. It looks clean however, the bathroom does smell like urine. I can see that the grout under the base of the toilet is not clean. Around the tub isn't caulked which is crazy and you can see mold or grime.

If the hotel reads this review, please caulk these areas! I'm American so I don't know how much a tube of caulk costs around here, but I would assume 800 yen and this issue is fixed. Then you would get a 5 star review from me.

Update
I see behind the bidet attachment it is not clean and smells like piss.

Update after checking out
The staff at the counter were awesome, the room was nice, I personally cleaned the toilet and around the bidet attachment and the piss smell went away. I enjoyed the stay, but must say they need to clean the toilet better and do something around the tub. I had a great experience at this hotel. It could not be in a better position for shopping! The staff are responsive and their English is fantastic. They supported me to book tickets on the bullet train and even recommended local restaurants.

The staff also provided us with clean towels each day and extra pyjamas when asked. The only note I would have that was on 3 separate towels I discovered hair from the previous person. This was not much of an issue as they had given so many towels I just went to the next, but in the future I checked the towels more carefully.

All in all, it was a great experience and I would stay here in a heartbeat again. Unfortunately despite the good service and good location the room made it an unpleasant stay. The room was dusty and the bathroom smelled so badly of urine. It has a strange step up into the bathroom and the whole room is a wet room with clearly areas that cannot be cleaned which must be where the urine is collecting around the toilet and cant be cleaned. Also had a smell of mustmould. Needed to keep the bathroom door closed at all times and only have very quick showers due to the smell. Felt like a dirty aeroplane bathroom. The rooms are also very small so would not recommend for anyone on a longer holiday to Japan from overseas as the bags cant really fit anywhere in the room. I would only use this hotel for a quick stay only, with small bags and if you can handle the urine smell in the bathroom. The breakfast situation was really disappointing, and there was no attempt to rectify or resolve it. I don't eat pork, and there were only one or two non pork protein options available. I raised this with the front desk and they just took the feedback and made no attempt to resolve or settle my complaint. This was a prepurchased breakfast when I booked the hotel room. It shows me that this hotel is not interested in providing reasonable and good quality customer service. It is owned by an investment group, so I'm not surprised about the focus of the hotel. Beds are comfy, and bathrooms are roomier than most business hotels. I recommend finding a cheaper price closer to checkin, if you have free cancellation. We had a wonderful experience at Bespoke Hotel! We had a very late last minute checkin, and the staff was very kind and helpful the whole time. Many of them spoke excellent English not an expectation, but certainly a bonus. We even forgot a laptop in our room and were unable to call them for several days, but they kept it for us and we were able to get it back in perfect condition as soon as we returned.

Besides the service, the property was lovely! A clean and relaxing lobby and comfortable rooms. We would happily stay here again!","Monday: Open 24 hours

The location is great  near JR main station and metro. Lots of shops nearby to buy breakfastdinner. Also more typical breakfast can be ordered in the hotel starting at 630. When I was in the room, I could hear people talking in the hallway  but not to the point of being disturbed when sleeping. The staff was pleasant and helpful.
If I ever go to JapanOsaka again, I would pick this hotel again. Nice and simple business hotel very close to ShinOsaka station. Great for exploring nearby areas from the station and for heading into Osaka. Lawson and 7Eleven nearby for snacks and supplies. Friendly, attentive and professional staff. Clean building and clean rooms. Basic amenities provided. Water heats up very quickly. Firm comfortable mattress.
Convenience stores located nearby Daily  711
Can hear people walking upstairs  talking in the hallway Lovely clean hotel, with friendly staff, great location for getting around city and plenty of restaurants on your doorstep.  Would recommend staying here. I really enjoyed my stay! The location is great which is near a subway station and JR ShinOsaka.

The room is very clean  the Staff is very friendly and helpful! Arigatogozaimasu!

The only recommendation I have is to have more than one WasherDryer as guests have to compete or wait to use them, especially during the evening time.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Tattoos are a big NO, as in most cases in japan. Better if you get one in a RYOKAN that has private baths. We had a lovely stay at Dormy. The kids really enjoyed the free ice cream in the evenings on 13F. We only ate the free ramen one time but it was pretty tasty. We were never up early enough for the yogurt and skipped the 1800 yen hotel breakfast for that reason.

The beds were comfy. The room booked for 4 including one child was actually two twins and a futon mat. My other kids slept under the closet in the nook which she thought was great!

The location was generally ok but quite a walk from the centre 35 min. Not insurmountable. The closet train station was a maze so taking the train only shaved about 10min so we opted for the walk usually.

Some pretty good nearby food though in a pinch! The property was nice and clean. It had many amenities, such as free yoghurt drinks during the day and free soba noodles and ice cream in the evening. A very popular extra gauging from the number of people waiting for this in the evening. A free onsen on the property was a nice touch but can get very crowded. Room was clean and comfortable. Fairly walkable to the closest subway. A few nice dining options around the area. They will hold on to your luggage before check in and after check out for a few hours. Would stay again when in Osaka. Nice experience. Very helpful staff. Special thanks to Ibuki Torigoe San, who is so devoted.

Facilities are exceeding expectations, essentially the spa, free snacks and the washing  drying machines. Free coffee at lobby area is not drinkable, common area where you could enjoy outside fb is an added value.

Overall speaking, a much better place then the nearby APA Hotel. Would certainly stay with them again. stayed for 3 nights end of April.  The housekeeping had never serviced our room.  They only provided new towels but never entered our room to clear up the litter box.  Public bath is located at the top floor 13 and it was ok average.  The cleanliness of the room and the beds were okay but could be better.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Clean rooms. a little narrow for our built. We're larger sized Asians.

Room cleaning done every 4th day of your stay. If you do not want anyone to enter your room at all throughout the stay, just inform the front desk before 10am or at check in.

Breakfast uses simple ingredients made in various ways. don't expect to find very extensive meal selection but you can expect every dish to be very well done. there's an Englishspeaking gentlemen who tends to the soups and other arrangements around the breakfast selection. if you need help and you can't speak a word a Japanese he's your goto man. what we didn't like was it didn't seem to offer lunch or dinner options I did not fully verify this. there was also no shelter to the subway. the 2min walk could be detrimental during bad weather. always wait out for the rainstorm before leaving. One of the best hotel in Osaka. Had a pleasant stay here.
1 Very close to station and Dotonbori
2 A delicious and variety breakfast is provided every day and it is complementary.
3 Room service was very nice.
4 Free locker facility is provided at the basement
5 They store the luggages shipped from different location. Great stay for our first night in Japan. Short walk to the Dotonbori area. We had the family room, very spacious, with two bathrooms which turned out to be quite convenient. Luggage storage provided. Greatcomfortable options for breakfast which was included as part of the stay. Umbrellas available for guest use which was a plus for our day trip during a rainy day. Friendly staff especially the breakfast crew. The hotel had self checkin that is impersonal and spits out your room card. Room is clean but very small. At 1030 am, I received a call from the front desk staff demanding that I come down and pay immediately 1000 yen for overstaying. I told him it was a mistake as I thought checkout was at 11. He yelled and said it was their policy and demanded I pay the yen before leaving. Absolute worst experience Ive had while in Japan! Very clean, convenient, and well kept hotel at a very affordable price. All rooms come with a free breakfast buffet which had a great tasty selection.

You wont get a crazy nice view or fancy room here but for the price, its very worth it. Rooms were very clean and the staff was really nice. Big lobby for you to wait for friends or hang around and also has a coin laundry room.

This hotel is located in an area where a lot of adult services happen so you will notice certain types of people around the hotel as well as in the lobby. But honestly, this happens everywhere in Japan and very much so in Osaka so if you dont pay too much attention its not a problem. Outside of that, great location with a Lawsons and train 12 minutes away. Major tourist spots like dotonbori is also within walking distance.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The rooms were clean, the bathrooms were as if no one ever was in there. I dont know japanese well but they showed me some words! One of the staff members gave me a site to go called ""ma paseit"" to practice idk if I spelled it right but it made me feel like they cared about me! I recommend this place if you want something cheap Spotless convenient hotel near Shin station. Provides breakfast if wanted. Staff super nice and location gives access to going to Osaka Downtown Kyoto or even Kobe. Yes the rooms are smaller and the bathrooms too but not unlike anything else in Japan. If you don't have too much luggage it's definitely worth staying here. I'd book again. Locations was great, only 5 minutes walk from ShinOsaka station, just make sure you take the right exit otherwise you'll spend 15 minutes figuring things out like us, shinosaka is a very big station, take the exit from ShinOsaka Metro station, not JR. Room was smaller than expected, but for the price and location, it's great value. They have public onsen at the hotel too, so it was great. Good Location, 5 min walk from metro  10 min walk from Shin oSaka.

Good clean  proper 3 star hotel. In breakfast they hav meal box, which was good variety  portion. They have lounge area  free coffee.

The rooms are smaller  hardly space to keep big luggages. They have washing machines  dryer. They also have free public bath.

There is good restaurants  lawson stores just infront of it. Had a great stay here. Rooms are small but felt cosy and sound proof. Shower was great and bath was a bonus. We could use pyjamas and had fresh towels waiting outside our door every morning. Close to the station and kind staff greeting us. Onsen also very nice.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Positives first, the location is good and the staff super friendly. But that's already it, the beds in the dorms are terrible. The mattress is super thin, it's basically like camping outdoors. The pillow is okay at least and gives some support. There are barely any shelves or space in the dorm bunk beds... And be aware that you might not fit in comfortably if you're over 185cm tall. The overall cleanliness isn't great either in the toilets and bathroom area. Also two toilets and showers are very optimistic for up to 22 people. There are also zero amenities, not even cotton buds. Overall not well planned and done, there's definitely better value for money somewhere else. Absolutely loved this hostel one of the best ones i stayed in during my Japan trip.
almost silent rooms with adjustable Aircon.
everyone who stays here is so kind and the staff are awesome my only downside is that there's no free amenities and you have to make he bed yourself but for the price i feel that's totally fair.
lots of love!! The location is awesome really but the service provided is strange since I usually dont go to hostel I wont make a critic but rather an observation
you have to make your own bed.
towel and stuff like Qtip are not provided.
The beds in the dormitory are not long enough, I mesure 180 cm and my feet are touching the borders.
There are no usable stairs??
You have to buy a drink to stay in the cafe space which is sad I think but why not.

So I dont really know what to think about this but, again, I loved the locations. Great hostel in a good location near the centre and Dotonburi. All the rooms are clean and modern with helpful staff too.

You can pay for the breakfast in the morning and leave your bags a bit of extra time if you want to as well. Nice enough hostel that has to utilise its space well, however, this was my first hostel where everything was made up bar the mattress sheet  you have to do that yourself  which I thought was both strange ?to save moneytime with housekeepers  and I used to be one!! and extremely inconvenientdifficult for the higher bunks, which I was in. Rooms are narrow and tricky when theres lots of luggage and I could hear noise from other rooms. Laundry facilities were fine but took 4 rounds in the dryer for clothes to finally be dry 400 yen. There was also only one lift and no stairs only emergency stairs so at peak times it could be busy. The air vents in the room were noisy and the air con in the bathroom was blowing cold air at full speed too so was a bit of a breezy place stayed early April.

Beds were comfortable enough otherwise. Showers were good. You had to buy a drink to sit in the communal area downstairs too.

It was a fine stay for two nights but I wouldnt personally choose here if I was in the city again group travelling so an assigned location.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

As a solo traveler, this hostel was great to meet other travelers especially the staff. Yoshi and James were amazing hosts and gave great recommendations around the town and even went clubbing with them for a night. They also rent bicycles at a very reasonable price and Osaka is an amazing city to explore with a bike. I would definitely come back to Mad Cat for the amazing people and the two mascots. This is a remarkable hostel that does everything right. Its clean, friendly, cute, and more. Youll have a blast here. I didnt meet the owner, but shoutout to Pedro and Yoshi some of the coolest hostel workers youll encounter.
Some people complained about the location, but it didnt bother me. Great little hostel, perfect place to meet other travellers! The hosts really make you feel at home. The two cat brothers give a zen vibe and are great to pet. The hostel's bar is a cool place to dcompress after a long day of sightseeing, and you can even meet some of the locals there. The living room area is really nice too, great way to start the day over a cup of coffee

Best wishes from Poland ! The best hostel in my trip in Japan! The staff is very kind and friendly cats included!. They'll offer you one drink per night by their bar. Great place to meet other travelers.  Finally, the hostel is located in a quiet part of the city where you won't have any problems finding cafes and resturants. Loved this hostel! Very clean, friendly owner and manager. The cats are great! The only thing is that the location is not ideal. It's a tram ride to the train station or a 1520 minute walk.","Monday: 3:00 PM – 12:00 AM

The environment created makes it really easy for solo travelers to make friends.  Best hostel experience I've ever had. Thanks Tomo! a neighbourhood away from too much of the busy central Osaka, this was perfect for our first stop in Japan. The hostel was so comfy with friendly staff, and helpful recommendations for local food too! Would come back! Ive never felt safer or more at home staying somewhere than I have at Air Osaka, the vibes are immaculate! Friendliest staff and the overall atmosphere seems to attract the kindest souls from all over! 10010 recommend staying here. Very much an authentic hostel experience. The rooms were nowhere near as nice as the photos made them seem. The wall looked like they were starting to fall apart, which isn't a deal breaker by any means, but when we found a cockroach, we couldn't stay here.

The owner was super helpful, and reimbursed us for the night and ensured the problem would be taken care of. One of the best social hostels in the world. If you want to enjoy Osaka this is the place to stay. Access to Yotsubashi line 2 minute walk. The bar and kotatsu area of the hostel is a good place to make friends, relax, enjoy the arts and music.

Mii was incredibly helpful and kind. Rooms were good and bed was pretty comfy with heavy duty duvet. Location was perfect with amazing restaurants and so close to Dontonbori. Mii was the best host I could ask for. She personally came early to drive us to the luggage delivery service to help us schedule delivery. She also drove us to the train stop. She exceeded all expectations! Will be recommending this place to anyone visiting! What a great guest house. Mii is awesome and speaks great English. Lovely conversations with her.

Its got some cons, but my experience here outweighs them.

Super thin walls and only two showers with one sink were my only complaint. But the private room was great and affordable. Ill stay here next time in Osaka! Mii was very kind when communicating with us for the check in and she said she could wait for us if needed until 23h, luckily we arrived earlier. Location is really convenient, you have close Namba and Dotombori. We stayed in a double room that was spacious. It had a weird smell when we arrived, we had to leave the window open during the whole evening and night. The bedsheets were clean, and the toilet and common areas were very clean also. It is a noisy street with cars  people, so you cant expect to hear nothing during the night. All in all, good value for the money we paid for the one night we spent in Osaka. My partner and I had a wonderful stay at Miis hostel. It was clean, safe, and perfectly located near the Osaka subway line and Doutonbori. Id happily stay here again. The staff were friendly, we're met with smiles.

There was a water dispenser, hot or cold.
With coffee and tea complementary.

Showers were equipped with shampoo, hair conditioner and shower gel.
The shower cubicle was sufficiently big, and has a  section for dressing.
Showers and toilets were clean.

The bed was comfortable with a heavy duvet slept well. We were given an extra upon request. That was nice.

Enough power points on the wall for multiple charging.

Location great  it's really near to the shopping street, Sennichimae Doguyasuji Shopping Street,  with many restaurants and figurines stores.

It's a short walk from the metro station, however, the stairs from the platform to exit 2 was a killer if you have large luggage or backpacks!

There's a laundromat around the corner 5 mins walk  300 for a 30 min wash without detergent provided, and 300 for 30min  industrial size dryer. There's a choice of using the bigger washer , slightly more expensive but it comes with detergent with the wash.

There's a supermarket right next to the laundromat. We bought a small pack of detergent from them.","Monday: 4:00 – 10:00 PM

I still remember the owners being very nice to me and my friend. We ordered two slices of cakes and Chai Latte. The cozy vibe and the sunny light filtering through the windows that day, together with the homemade cakes, really turned this adventure of mine in a good memory. Its my first home in Japan, and everything feels cozy the moment I step in.The place is exceptional since its located in the Shinsekai district. This is my first time staying at a hostel, but I didnt worry about the cleanliness because they always have staff cleaning the entire room. Shoutout to them for their meticulous care! 

The staff are all so welcoming, even though Im quite introverted. Thank you to them for trying to communicate in English to cater to our needs, day or night.   I also had no trouble conversing with my roommates from overseas theyre all friendly. Thank you, everyone, for making my first experience in Japan so welcoming. 

P.S. I regret not buying from their caf and tasting their coffee.  So impressed. The welcome. The staff. The location. The room. The BUNK!!! Okay Im writing this review because of how amazing the bunks are. The thoughtful touches Somebody clearly thought about this. They really put themselves in the guests shoes here. So much organization. Private curtains. Window. Little shelving unit with 3 shelves. Room for bottles. Lamp. Power outlet. Mirror. Laundry hanger. Lockbox. Hook at entrance. 3 hooks along wall. 2 coat hangers. Side area for extra storage. All within the bunk. It feels so luxurious. Communal bathroom sink area in adjoining door. Separate 1. Urinal 2. Toilet 3. Shower rooms within adjoining room. I love it!

Only thing is that it was very uncomfortably warm at night. There was no breeze the night I stayed there so was difficult to sleep. If traveling during warmer months I recommend buying a cheap fan at one of the many nearby electronics stores to plug in by your bed. Did not stay here, but went here on a whim for a coffee and a sandwich after a long day. It was one of my favorite places we went to in Osaka. The staff were so, so nice. They have a nice selection of records on sale and after browsing them I chatted with one of their patrons, who recommended I check out Yumi Arais earlier records. I did not end up buying the record the nice man recommended me, and I regret it deeply, because I checked it out once back at my hotel and its since become one of my favorite albums of all time. The album was MISSLIM by Yumi Arai. Ill always think of The Pax and my amazing trip to Japan  when I play it. Thank you for a magical time, the staff are wonderful, location wonderful and vibes are great. The rooftop and nice details throughout the hostel were a joy.

HIPPO Hostel & Cafe Bar,"2-chōme-11-13 Tsuruhashi, Ikuno Ward, Osaka, 544-0031, Japan",4.4,34.6642728,135.5320642,"This is a review for the cafe. The person behind the counter seemed surprised when I walked in, seemed surprised when I ordered a latte to go even though the door says ""take out ok"". Then gave it to me in a plastic cup more suited for an iced beverage, so it was hot to carry. The coffee itself, not great. Oh well, had to give it a try. Pros

The hostel was clean and wellmaintained.
Staff were amicable when interacting outside their circle.

Cons

The staff seemed more inclined to interact with each other than with the guests. It was challenging to feel integrated into their conversations or activities.

The professionalism of the staff left something to be desired. Given that they are young and unpaid, this may be a factor in their behavior.

There were instances where staff displayed inappropriate behavior in front of guests, which can be uncomfortable for many.

Unlike my past experiences with Japanese hostels where the staff work quietly in the background, the staff here were very present and noticeable. Surprisingly, a significant number of people around were staff members.

Conclusion

While the hostel was clean and the exterior interactions with staff were pleasant, the overall atmosphere felt exclusive and not always welcoming to guests. Improvements in staff professionalism and behavior would enhance the guest experience. I loved this Hostel! Its very cozy, has a beautiful interior with a clean botanical vibe. The beds are comfy, the staff are very friendly and inviting, and we felt right at home instantly! I also loved how big the rooms were, which made it nice for repacking my bag on the last day. The lockers provided are really bigI was able to fit my giant backpack and all valuables. The balconypatio area is great, awesome to hang out in any time of day and would be perfect for doing yoga! I also loved the kitchen nice big fridge, easy to make coffeetea, and burners for cooking. Its also right by the subway station which is super convenient. I would definitely recommend it!  I've never walked out of a hostel or hotel before, but this place was so bad that I couldn't bear it. Do yourself a favor and ignore all the promo pictures that were taken by a professional photographer. Look at the photos taken by guests. See the dirt? See the cockroach in the sink? That's what it's really like.

After a long day of traveling, I wanted to take a nap. The curtains on the bunks are held up with shower poles and offer zero privacy. The ones on the upper bunks don't even reach the ceiling to block out light. The room was about 30 C with the air conditioner on full blast, and the upper bunks were like saunas. There's no ventilation in the bunks at all.

Even though it was outside of quiet hours, I didn't expect that employees and guests would stand around in the bedroom having the loudest possible conversations video attached. Only after they woke up three different people did they decide that they should take it downstairs. The employee who showed us around seemed bored and uninterested. The whole place had a very unclean vibe with people's laundry strung about wherever. There are lockers for your items but no locks on them. Oh, and there appeared to be twice as many employees as guests all daydrinking in the cafe area. I have no idea what that's about, but the atmosphere was trashy.

If you're a student or backpacker on a tight budget, maybe you won't mind all of this. But I've stayed at quite a few budget hostels in Japan and this is the first time I've been so irritated that I just left and let them keep my money. I then booked a room at Dormy Inn and slept like a baby.

Finally, beware of the good reviews. I've read more than one review claiming that HIPPO staff bribed guests with alcohol in exchange for a good review. They posted photos of the sign promising it, so I'm inclined to believe it. This place deserves 2 stars at the absolute best.

Update 20230911 I contacted the owner and explained my complaints. At first I was told that there were no refunds for a ""no show,"" but I was not a noshow I checked in. When I described the heat, noise, and messiness, I was told that it's all just part of the ""hostel atmosphere."" Nonsense.

I've stayed in plenty of hostels that were clean and comfortable. I asked for a full refund since I did not stay and had to find a different hotel. I was offered a 50 refund and then completely ignored. It has been over a week and the owner refuses to respond. 4bed female dorm is decent. Clean and comfortable.

The top floor mixed dorm had like 10 beds? I got a top bunk and it was not very clean. The curtain kept falling every time I got close to it. There was also smell of summer body odor in the room. Would not want to stay in this room again.

There are 23 flights of stairs depending on the room. Staff is really friendly, and helped carry my luggage. Location is good enough for general Osaka exploration.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The facility is decent for the price. However, there are quite a few middleaged men in their around 40s actually living here and often occupying the common area, so if you are looking for a fun backpacking hostel vibe, it is not the place for you.

It is more like a flophouse than a hostel. Cosy hostel in a quiet part of Osaka. Conveniently located on the Osaka Loop Line, which makes it accessible from Osaka Station. Interior is a little bit tired, but overall I had a very comfortable stay the pillow was so soft!! i visited Osaka in November 2023 and was very pleased with this accommodation. I'am a humble traveler who likes to be on her feet all day long but for the nights this place was perfect. the bunk beds were cozy and i liked the extra space 2meter beds. the staff was friendly and helpful. the place was also clean and altough there is a Karaoke bar nearby, it was quiet during the nighttime. its only a short walk to the metrostation, convenience stores and a large supermarket. very fair for this price. Great experience overall. Met some nice people. The common area is quite lively at some hours, usually in the evenings. The beds are comfortable and cozy. There are sockets for each bed, a light and a little shelf. They have towels you can rent for 100 yen but it might be better to simply bring your own. The kitchen and fridge is also available for all guest to use.
There are showers for each dorm and toilets are in the common area.
Very well situated 10 min walk from Osaka Castle Park, a few minutes from Tamatsukuri station, has multiple convenience store and a supermarket only minutes away by foot. If I could give more than five stars I would.. in six months of travel, absolutely the most kind and nice staff I have ever met in addition to the low price they charge and the excellent conditions they provide. Comfortable and new beds, there is privacy and quiet but still the atmosphere is warm. Because of my misunderstanding I got stuck without a night in Osaka, the staff turned the place around to arrange a blanket and pillow for me and let me sleep on the couch, for free! Highly recommend!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Signs up saying they charge for everything. Weird interactions with staff with one almost opening the door while I was in the bathroom. 4 hours of shower cleaning time and overall just dirty. Location is bad and out of every hostel I stayed at this was the worst by far. Peeling walls in the rooms and so insanely loud. 20 minutes from the good areas of Osaka, not fun. Clean rooms, friendly staff and password secured front door. the curtains in the male shared bathroom are not private enough, and reception is only open from 69pm, but given the cheap price, its a good value. regular events like cooking are held there are shared toilets on every floor so no worries Very weird vibes throughout, didnt feel very nice staying there at all. And rules up everywhere saying theyll fine you. Meh location in the city, youll want something closer to the big spots and get frustrated by the trains. Ive stayed in 30 hostels on four different continents and this is the worst one Ive ever stayed at. The facilities were old, filthy, rundown, uncomfortable, and you could hear every noise. The other guests mostly foreign, like me, were also loud, rude, and inconsiderate and turned on the light in the middle of the night.  The pictures online do not match the facility. The beds in the dorm are uncomfortable and old, the sheets are dirty and old, and the room was set to an uncomfortably high temperature making it impossible to sleep. Although the price was very low, it was 100 not worth it and I would recommend avoiding this place. If you like dive bars, then this is a good spot for you.
I didn't really like it because it was cramped, crowded, and dirty.
The beds were clean though, no bed bugs. Super small common area, showers were all on the 2nd floor. No AC in common area, only in rooms, which someone shut off so it was super hot.
Vending machine on 2nd floor had alcohol but no water.

The vast majority of guests stay just for a place to sleep, and with almost 40 beds in a room it's easy for one bad person to ruin your experience.

The cafe and coffee machine were decent, but there's no social atmosphere at all. The bathroom was cleaned and had some of the best showers I've seen in any hostel, but half were out of service. Not really social and the beds get a bit uncomfortable but great location and cute chill areas with free miso soup, coffee and tea Really clean . And proper . The location is the best especially if you stay short time in town . I recommend this one . Check out out in Japan is early . Like 10 am . But its ok The rooms are good, but the only thing is there is no elevator. This is probably the nicest hostel I've ever stayed at. The morning breakfast was delicious and there's lots of space in the common areas to hang out. The decor was really nice and unique and the washroom was kept very clean. My only issue is that it's a nonsmoking facility, yet the hallways always smelled like smoke and I saw a guest smoking. This rule needs to be enforced better.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM

The rooms are small typical Japan style but really clean and cozy. The shared bathrooms are the cleanest Ive ever seen at a hostel.

For the price, its about as good as you can get in Japan and Id definitely stay again! I really enjoyed my stay the most out of any hostel in Japan. The atmosphere is amazing with lots of social people easy to talk to. Especially, the breakfast I loved eating it. Highly recommend to book with breakfast included  Best stay I've done so far traveling.
The experience was great, met some awesome and cheerful souls all week long, each with their own particularly and uniqueness.
Special thanks to each and everyone of you guys, wish you all the best in life and to accomplish your goals.
Will definitely be back here when I come back to Osaka. I had high hopes for this hostel considering all the other great reviews, but honestly, my stay was not good.

I paid on arrival with my card you cannot pay with cash, the payment went through and I could see it had been approved on the card machine, and the transaction showed on my banking app too. I was then approached on 4 separate occasions throughout my stay, being told my payment hadn't gone through. I showed them the transaction on my banking app which never bounced back at all!, and the staff member would then leave me alone, before approaching me again at a later date asking again for payment! I'm not sure if they were trying to scam me or if it was just poor staff training but it made me really uncomfortable for the duration of my stay, as I was always feeling like I was going to be confronted again, when I had already paid! I really felt harassed and was made to feel like I had done something wrong, when it was not my mistake.

The room itself was OK, it felt very humid and the sheets felt damp, I think this might be due to the airconditioning unit, which has signs saying you cannot have the temperature set lower than  25 degrees or it will leak.

I found lots of black hairs that weren't mine in the bed, which made me question the cleanliness of the sheets.

The shower was good and size of the room better than some other Japanese hostelshotels. The bed was hard but this also seems to be standard here.

Late check in of 4pm is also a lot later than usual. The hotel was very cozy. Every morning I went to the FamilyMart around the corner and the 711 on the other corner to get breakfast and sit at the communal table to chat with other travelers! The kitchen is very nice and you get many opportunities to talk to other travelers.

Negatives  The room itself was very small and cramped. It was difficult to fit 4 suitcases in the room. The hotel is also a bit further away from the metro station and you have to walk and cross some streets.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 11:00 PM

The service is also very nice and helpful. I liked it very much, I stayed there for 2 days and it was great Great Location. Hard to findextremely small! Not all staff spoke English. Located less than one minute walk from the JR Noda Station off the Osaka Loop Line, Rota Hostel is conveniently placed. The staff were all quite pleasant and they offer selfcheckin if you arrive after hours. I booked a very small private room just room for a bed and a small fridge so the noise was minimal but there were children running around the halls and they could be clearly heard until I used some earplugs. There are lockers available for those not in a private room. A patio, lounge, and kitchen area are all available to guests.
Access to this hostel required walking up to the third floor, this is not accessible unless you are able to make the climb! The entrance is a bit easy to miss unless you keep a sharp eye out. Hotel is good
Staff is beyond excellent
30 sec walk from the jr station It was very close to the station, about 10 steps on foot. The interior is very beautiful, but you have to go up the stairs to the third floor as soon as you open the door, so it's difficult for people with suitcases. It says that if you need assistance, please contact the staff, but do you have to go to the third floor, call them, and then come back down and get your suitcase?

Very inviting laidback common area with a kitchen, washerdryer, and even a few games and take oneleave one books.

The rooms are on the floors above. We stayed in a room full of bunk beds each with its own private curtain and accommodated 20, and we had no noise issues. It was extremely quiet. Everyone seemed to respect those around them.

Definitely a place for travellers for check out while theyre in Osaka! We really enjoyed it. Great value hostel, in a good location of Osaka. I had a great experience thanks to the wonderful staff, especially Hideka, Satomi, and Ryota. They went out of their way to welcome me and helped me extensively when I lost my phone in the city. Extremely grateful for their hospitality. This place is great. I stayed here my last visit to Osaka and enjoyed it so much I made it a point to stay here again. The location is one of a kind and central to many sites and nightlife. Its above a convenient train station so its very easy to navigate to and from. I didnt have a great stay and checked out 2 nights early. I was staying on the top bunk and the bottom bunk person had food and trash everywhere and it remained like that for 2 days. The staff does not seem to put much effort in cleaning. The beds are thin but okay and the room gets pretty warm, but the location is good. Overall very dissapointed and no refund was given. It was my first time at a hostel. Even though it was my first time, I booked a full month!

I felt welcomed and was always integrated in social activities by the manager Ryota!
It was defenetly one of my best experiences since I started travelling through Asia!

I don't have anything bad to say about this place!
It was a fantastic time and I appreciate you, Ryota, and of course the whole staff working there at that time!

The dorms are exceptionally clean and provide plenty of privacy, even when fully occupied. The mattress was super comfortable, and the air conditioning was a lifesaver during the hot Osaka summer. Anytime I needed something, the friendly staff at the reception and bar were always available to help. The bar is a great spot to connect with other travelers, and locals often stop by in the evenings, adding to the lively atmosphere. Daniel, the bartender, can whip up any drink you ask for, and they were always topnotch! For those moments when I wanted a bit more privacy, I appreciated the option to use the back entrance to skip the bar area altogether. The location is also perfectjust a 2minute walk to the subway, with a supermarket and places to eat right around the corner. Highly recommend staying here! There is no common room, the bar opens at 1500, until then you dont see the staff. There is one bathroom and one shower for the communal floor. In the communal room there was no AC or it turned off on at night. The staff were very nice and knowledgeable about the city. The beer at the bar was cheap and the location is very walkable. It honestly baffles me that this place is so highly rated.

The positives the bed is comfy. Its within walking distance to some restaurants and bars and transportation.

The negatives
The AC doesnt work for a dorm room of 12 people. Everyone in my room is talking about how hot it is. Theres one shower, one toilet, one sink for 12 people. The water in the sink only runs VERY hot which is gross considering how hot it is all day and night.
There is no space to put your bags in the room at all. Everyone just scatters their things all over the floor.

Theres no proper common area at all, so theres no where for anyone to socialize or chill except in the hot dormitory room. There is a bar downstairs which technically serves as the socializingcommon area, but its absolutely tiny and only opens at 3pm. Its literally a bar with one table and 4 chairs.

There is

Think twice before staying here. I paid for 4 nights and Im going to leave before my stay is up because its that bad. I hope they will refund part of my stay because everything about this hostel is misleading. No AC and no common room is an absolute disaster. Super fun bar with great people and great drinks. I really enjoyed staying there for 3 days. Has a washer and dryer with very comfortable beds and clean sheets. I will definitely be back on my next vacation. Best Party Hostel in Osaka. I stayed in 3 places in Osaka and this was my favourite. Great location, the staff are really fun, and the beds were great. The bar is also well stocked and full of great people to hang out with.

Very modern very clean, the staff always smiling and helpful. The common areas are also very spacious with a kitchen if needed.
I put 4 for location because you need to take the metro to go in the city center but it is still closeby. Lovely new stay and good price for a hostel in Osaka. Especially the common area was super nice to use with friends. Very clean and suitable hostel, I felt I was a bit far away from everything was the only thing for me which is a deal breaker for me. The staff were kind and gave explanations that were easy to understand, making it easy to ask questions.
I had a question I wanted to ask, and when I emailed them in advance, I received a polite reply.
It's still a new hostel, but the building itself used to be a different inn and was renovated. It didn't look old and had a hygienic atmosphere.
It was a hot day, but the air conditioner was working well.
The mattress is soft.
There was a shared kitchen and floor where you could eat, and there was also a microwave, kettle, IH stove, etc. The showers are also on the same floor and are unisex.
There was also a toilet, washroom, and small refrigerator on each floor.
WiFi is convenient both in bed and on the common floor.
The only bed space is a mattress and a small shelf. There is no space for large luggage. However, considering the price, I think the narrowness is acceptable. I only had a backpack, so I placed it at the foot of the bed.
This time I was on the top bunk of the bed. Since the inside can be seen through the curtain frame, it may be safer for women to reserve a bed for women.
There is a charge for towels, but I believe you can rent them for around 100 yen.

The front desk will be unmanned after 11pm, but if you call, they will open it right away, so you can go out at night.

It was close to the station, generally sanitary, and cheaper than other dormitories and capsules in Osaka city. Above all, the staff had a great atmosphere, so I would like to use them again if I go to Osaka again. I decided to stay here because it was by far the cheapest in the area.I was a little worried about the price, but it was much better than staying at a famous business hotel.
The shared shower room and toilet were generally clean, and although I was worried about sharing them, they were designed so that I could use them with peace of mind, so I didn't have any problems.
I was a little concerned because the refrigerator was shared, but it wasn't a problem.
The room is simple but has a Japanese feel, and the futon is much fluffier and more comfortable than a business hotel bed.

The hostel was very dirty. The only toilet was broken and made a loud noise when used. The floor was sooo sticky, and there was only one toilet and two showers for all the girls, which made it really uncomfortable.

On top of that, there was construction happening on the floor until 1230 AM, YES! 1230 AM! How crazy is that. It sounded like a drill but Im not pretty sure.

The windows didnt block the sounds from the busy road outside, making it hard to sleep and the WiFi didnt work for most of the time I stayed there.

The beds were very basic, and the lights were poorly placed. The curtains didnt provide enough privacy, and you could hear everything, showers, people in the toilets, so it was far from quiet.
The bed doesnt go until the top so theres a big bag, which allows all the light to come in.

The blinds let in too much morning light, the room doesnt get dark.

I even found a spider in the toilet this morning.

There was a conversation happening with some other guests, and the girls Ive spoken to, were unhappy about how dirty and uncomfortable the place was.
I can just tell what Ive heard from them.

I didnt see any locals staying there, which doesnt surprised me given Japans high cleanliness standards. I was reading the bad reviews earlier and the owner actually confirmed that less than 0.1 of the guests are Japanese.

Its not standard for them and it shouldnt be to anyone.

There were signs everywhere warning people about the rules, like dont touch it keep it away dont open it only staff can touch it you will be fined, which made it feel more like a prison. There was no real social area or kitchen just two couches by the reception where the staff were always around, making it not really private.

Im glad I only stayed for one night. The owner was somewhat friendly and let me leave my luggage before checkin, but the overall vibe was off. The location is 5 min walking distance from a subway.

If youre thinking about booking here, please consider another place or wait until they fix these problems.

Its hard to believe a hostel like this exists in Japan, where Ive found much cleaner places in poorer countries.

After traveling for six months full time and visitingI I over 40 countries in my life, this was one of the worst places I've stayed.

I hope thats helpful for people out there looking for a place to stay. This hostel was fine, clean, the beds were comfortable, the shower was working well, there is a nice social area and the location is great near Dotombori. But, except for the music and the decoration, there was absolutely nothing chill about this hostel. I understand that some rules are necessary when you welcome people from all over the world, but that many?? I dont think so. There were just so many meaningless random rules in this place. For example in the bathroom there were some towels, and on the towel box it was written that those should only be used to dry your hand and not your face. Or on the water fountain it was written that you should not use it to fill up your water bottle, etc. Those are no big deals obviously, but in my opinion it just created a weird, controlling and stressful vibe to the place I think I just really didnt understand the purpose of those. Also I was extremely tired so I overslept 100 my fault and had to pay a late check out fee totally makes sense, but this fee was 3000!! Thats 18. This is what a night cost so I just think this is a bit abusive. Hostel Chillax Osaka offers a great stay with a prime location near Dotonbori. Most staff are lovely, making the experience enjoyable, though one was a bit rude. The hostel is clean and comfortable, providing a welcoming atmosphere. Overall, a solid 4star stay for convenience in exploring Dotonbori. When arriving at hostel Chillax, we were very friendly welcomed by the host. The hostel is a cosy, yet convenient accommodation with all basic needs provided.

The group room was spacious, quiet, clean, and had a nice atmosphere either little retro props here and there.

The locations is not the closest to all the energetic areas of Osaka, but definitely still walkable. During the day you can always take the subway which is very close by.

In general the hostel feels very welcoming. The staff is helpful and friendly, and it is definitely one of the more social places I had stayed in Japan. And if you are into reggae, or sometimes other live music, you will not be disappointed. But if you just want to relax after a long day of eating delicious food in Osaka, but not feel completely lonely after you come home, this is a very nice place to reside. Dear Chillax staff, Thanks for giving me an amazing experience in Japan! I very enjoyed staying, with chill and cozy vibes, clean and tidy rooms, and I was especially happy to meet lovely staff!

Did all the basics fine, decent bed, decent shower etc. Also had good kitchen and communal area.

Issues included that none of the toilet bidets worked, the aircon unit was very badly positioned and was actually inside one of the bunk beds meaning that one person would get all the cold air and everyone else would get very little. The front door was also never locked which was actually kind of convenient but would certainly bother some people. We had an okay stay.

The location of the hostel is very good and close to the metro station and it is easy to find. As we arrived very early, we had the opportunity to leave our luggage at the hostel before checkin. The kitchen is very large and has everything you need to cook for yourself. There are also lockers and there is an okonomiyaki night at the hostel, which is very cool. In general, the atmosphere was also very good among the people and it was easy to make contact.

The negative sides We felt like our bedding wasn't changed or washed before our stay. It was definitely not clean. Overall everything was a bit dirty and used. One night there were very very drunk people right outside our door at 2am we had the first floor room talking loudly about who was the most drunk. The bathroom also looked very run down the next day. In general, there was a lot going on every night and as the hostel is very quiet, we could always hear everything. The absolute best place for price and cheeriness ! Cheap and cheery at its best. Right in the center, and with so many kind and helpful people, each time I come I leave with new friends and new stories ! Very cozy guest house, i felt in home. It provides kitchen with necessary stuff to cook, lockers, a leaving room to share  good time and meet friends for all over the world and among other things. The building has a traditional Japanese style and the neighborhood it was very quiet and relaxing. Very recommended. I was one night there and looks unbelievable bad. I was in a really small bed in floor and one bunk bed lock side of there and locked all my way out. The wall was paper peeling and the smell is disgusting.  Bed bugs bit my legs and the kitchen looks super old and not clean.

When i arrived the staff dont care about me. I figure out by other guest there only have work exchange staff, so I undestand cause that they don't care about the guests.

The place is really difficult to found. Really weird area

You will need to be prepared for the noise in the room because your door is a curtain, and the inconvenience of getting yourself up and down the bed. But that's for every hostel. Loved this place.Will definitely come back and stay if I'm visiting USJ! Probably one of the better hostels we've stayed at. If you're planning on visiting Universal Studios in Osaka then the location is about as good as you can get while also remaining highly affordable per night was only around 35AUD per person.

It is only a short walk from the hostel to the station, and from the station it only takes around 2 stops to get to the USJ station which is great particularly if you want to get there early.

The facilities and bathrooms etc. were all clean as expected. The sleeping areas were much larger than other hostels usually you only get a bunk bed but in this location you get a bit of extra space alongside the bed as well.

The only downside is the other guests really. While we were staying in a shared room one of the guests kept putting the air conditioning unit on 26c for some ungodly reason, so it made it uncomfortable trying to sleep while the room was unbearably hot. I won't rate the hostel down a star just because the other guests were selfish, but keep it in mind that it may be an issue for you too. Very detailed and thorough with the informations. Everything is exactly as per pictures stated and communicated

A very good choice to stay for us as a family who plan to go for 1 day USJ visit. Very accessible and the extra services provided luggage storage  coin laundry are super plus point.

Its a hostel style stay, so other guests do play a part for the overall experience. Thankfully the other guests during our stay were mostly considerate. So we did have a pleasant stay

Will definitely recommend! The bed space was great. A little nook. Lost one star because the general areas were a little messy. Stayed here for one night  the next day we went to USJ.
Pros
very convenient
close to the train stationUSJ
affordable
the staff were very kind and easy to talk to
Options for private rooms no private bathroom

Cons
Odor!! As soon as we entered the hostel it smelled like a college dormitory stuffy and body odor... The smell was quite strong throughout the entire hostel. This was the biggest con.
Cleanliness. The rooms looked a bit beaten up and there were stains on the tatami. The stairs didn't look like they had been cleaned too recently.
Tight shower space. I'm quite petite but even for me it was a bit difficult to move around. Some Japanese hostels are like this, others aren't. I guess it really depends on the establishment.
Noise! Even though the hostel rules say no loud noisesconversations past 1000, there were guests who were speaking very loudly and we couldn't get much sleep... 

If you're looking for a quick place to stay and on a budget on your way to USJ, this may suit you. Ifwhen we go back to USJ though, I'll most likely be shelling out a little more to stay at a hotel...",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The first night there were many people, so it did get a little noisy, but not to the point I couldnt sleep. The second night the last night of Golden week there was very few people and at one point I had the shared space to myself. The shared space was really nice with a decent selection of books to read as well as comfy seating. After a long day of sightseeing it was nice to just unwind and read. The cafe was really nice and their drinks were delicious. I definitely recommend to anyone staying for a few days in Osaka, or even just visiting to relax for a few hours. If you have larger luggage there isnt a space to store it seems, but most people left outside of their capsule space. Im definitely planning on stopping by again. We got a double bed that was in the upper bunk. The bed was large enough for us but it was a bit hard to get into. There was also few spaces to put luggages, especially if you have a big one.

There is a cafe and their drinks and food are pretty ok. Interesting experience and cool vibe to sit in the common space to read books. The capsules were ok however the bathroom and floors a bit dirty Great concept but poor execution. We loved the idea of booking a book themed capsule hotel and decided to spend one night there. I'm very glad we only stayed one night. The decor is very nice but they played music all day and as late as 11pm which ruined the vibe for me. We booked a ""double"" capsule, which was tiny. It was also a top bunk, which is usually no problem, but the ladder for entry was offset from the opening and difficult to use. It was also incredibly hot overnight. The capsules have no ventilation at all. I haven't had this issue in other capsule hotels. Overall, I would not stay there again. The interior of the cafe has a very aesthetic design, but the food and drinks are not particularly good",no operation time,"cafe, lodging, point_of_interest, food, establishment"
Osaka Namba Hostel MIYABI,"2-chōme-7-26 Motomachi, Naniwa Ward, Osaka, 556-0016, Japan",4.3,34.6620588,135.4967377,"I stayed here as a solo female traveler, and unfortunately, my experience was quite unpleasant. The hostel seemed dirty from the moment I arrivedthe beanbags in the common area had a rotten smell, and the cooking space was filthy. The shower, sinks, living space, and kitchen are all crammed into one area, which felt really unsanitary and made privacy a concern.
While the beds were comfortable, the lack of safety and security overshadowed this. The lockers were so small they could only fit a phone or passport, and the rooms werent lockable, which made me feel uneasy about leaving my belongings. To make things worse, the toilets didnt have sinks nearby, so I had to go downstairs just to wash my hands.
The lobby area smelled of cold smoke, and no one was at the reception desk when I checked out, which added to the poor management of the place. Overall, I wouldnt recommend this hostel to anyone, especially solo female travelers looking for a safe, clean, and secure environment. I love the shared space the most since there are so many handsome and cute people staying here !!

If youre a traveler who goes hiking, camping, or looking for a place that allows you to do your own stuff quickly. This is the best option and the location is near Nankai station, the most convenient spot in Namba.

Its common to see people in and out with underwear around shower rooms and dorms, if you go to public bath thats the same thing, you can just do whatever makes you comfort and still respect other guests.

And the manager is nice, if any question you can just directly ask, he really cares if guests are happy and safe here.

Btw, theyre going to have local Japanese singer doing live events soon, please come and have fun!

This is my second time coming back, its really my second home other than my home country, Ive stayed here before on March 2024. The host was very hospitable, teaching me how to make waffles and even cooking dinner. I highly recommend this hostel. Thank you! I m Vst From Korea Second Time to  Osaka Japan .Best location near Center of Namba 10 minute to Dotonbur . This is my second time at  Myab Hostel very quiet and very clean Hostel  house keeping Japanese lady clean the all floor and restroom , I definitely recommend . Owner amazing super nice  .

Hostel Q,"2-chōme-6-9 Nishishinsaibashi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0086, Japan",4.0,34.6692657,135.4986176,"Stayed here in mid December in 2023 with 2 of my mates, and we couldn't have been happier! basement area had one of my fave things, a guitar, while also having enough space for a solid 23 dozen people. Kitchen area in basement was amazing and seating was incredible. Rooms weren't crazy good, but were definitely good enough to sleep in, overall the three of us had a great time and would come here again if offered the chance to come back to Osaka! Hostel Q is a classic backpackers stay. It's affordable, social and super close to the busy district of Dontonbouri. You're right in the middle of the action here! If you're looking for luxury, Hostel Q is not the place for you. If you're looking for a few quick nights to feel safe, sleep and party, this is definitely the right place. The lower floor is a socializingcommunal area with a kitchen and some seating. The main floor is reception with additional seating and as you work up the floors you see the hostel rooms. There are private rooms however they are bunk beds. The beds were moderately comfortable, AC was in the rooms and the bathrooms on every floor were relatively clean, I saw several staff cleaning the bathrooms daily. Some of the toilets still had a funky smell despite cleaning, but otherwise it was clean. We stayed here for 4 nights and loved how close it was to everything, including the train station just being a few minutes walk away. It was very affordable as well. I would recommend younger backpackers stay here! Hostel Q is located right in Dotonbori, which is so convenient for going out at night and  not having a long trip back. Room was fairly spacious, but the mattress was quite thin. Since youre in Dotonbori it will be quite noisy but I didnt have major problems falling asleep.
Good amount of showers, only a few toilets, and friendly staff. Location is amazing!
No bidet however.
The dorm on the second floor had a weird smell to it, but you get over it after a few nights.
The owner took me and a few others to a festival 15mins walk away! Super nice nice staff, I love Lily Very clean and safe space. Great location to explore Osaka from as it is close to two of the iconic neighborhoods. Staff is very helpful. Love the retro vibe around the place.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
GUEST HOUSE MATSU,"1-chōme-2-20 Matsu, Nishinari Ward, Osaka, 557-0034, Japan",4.2,34.6405285,135.4951355,"I got this place for around 2980 yen and honestly I cannot complain. The staff especially Jen and Honoda were some of the friendliest I've ever met in Japan so far. And the staff in a hostel make all the difference if it's good or bad. Don't count on it but when I was there they offered us light snacks and drinks had I so chosen. The facilities, like the shower, bathroom, and resting areas were all clean. And the resting area felt like just the right amount of beds as to not overwhelm you. I will be honest my beds curtain drooped a tad but that's probably for the better to let the sunlight in.  I only had two complaints which resulted in a loss of a star.  1, the sleeping area, although clean, had a feint strange smell, maybe a window needed to be open I'm not sure. My nose felt stuffy when I woke up too. This wasn't really a big deal I slept great the beds are awesome. But what isent awesome and I desperately ask the staff to resolve is the pillow. This pillow is the worst pillow I have ever slept on bar to none. I pretty much just put the big blanket underneath it so I can tolerate the nights sleep then sleep with the small blanket. If youre sleeping here, ask for an extra or two you'll thank me later Dont get me wrong I loved the hostel when I stayed there , the only thing that really bothered me was a worker name Sumera she was really inappropriate towards because I am jewish and from Israel , never encountered such hatred and antisemitism.
If I was the hostel owner I wouldnt hire her in the first place Thick layer of dust, snot and nail clippings on the floor next to the bunk bed. A respectably sized patch of driedup vomit on the underlayer mattress. The staff was nice, even the one who tried to scam me for 3000 yen even though the price on Agoda was around 2400.

All in all, a classic Osaka experience, 1010 will probably never return. It's an ok place to save money on a bed though. My buddy and I have been traveling around the entirety of Japan for a month. This was the only place I felt compelled to write a review for because of how much we loved it. We stayed for 3 nights and actually wished we stayed longer because it was our favorite. Out of all the hostels, it was easiest the cleanest by miles. The staff was so friendly and helpful with finding things to do. The 2 Australian guys that worked there, Kyle and Calem, were fantastic. Great food advice, were honest about if certain things were worth doing or not and were just incredibly hospitable. Will 100 be back on my next trip! I only spent a night at the place and was happy. I'm glad that the landlord kept my reservation, even when I had forgotten to tell my checkin time, and I was late by several hours. The rooms were clean and well ventilated.
The place is 710minutes walk from near subway stations, but it's easy to locate. It is a good stay for solo travelers.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The beds are only a thin mattress but the cover keeps you warm.
Location was great! Close to a train station and shopping centres.

The staff were lovely here, however we had another guest be very disrespectful towards us and swearing while we were up getting ready when it was not quiet time. My friends and I were very disappointed with his behaviour as we feel it has made our experience here tainted. Not sure if he faced any consequences either. Good place ! People are very friendly. Don't expect a Hotel. This is a HOSTEL. Your roommates may be loud... During the day management is here to help and clean.
Beds are mostly futons a bit thin, But covers keep you very warm.
Staff cleans the kitchen, showers and toilets everyday. They will try their best to if you need information or help!
Close to Tennoji and Shinsekai. So location is pretty nice to move around! I think in this case it's safe to say that you get what you pay for. Peace House offers an extremely affordable option for those of us who do not have money to spare.

The guests and staff were nice, quiet, and respectful.

Beds are spacious albeit very firmlightly padded. They have privacy curtains and little book lights.

The smellmusk was the only thing I took issue with. Not sure if it was the combo of grown men or the humidity or the old house or what. All I know is that I struggled with the very strong smell that became more noticeable when the windowsdoors were closed for long periods of time.

1015 mins away from tennoji station
3040 mins away from Dotonburi

All that being said  for how much I paid, I really couldn't have asked for more. Great option for those who aren't sensory sensitive and wanting to see Osaka on the cheap. Well, to me this isn't just a guesthouse, it truly feels like my second home now!
I came here for the entire month of April, and loved it here!
The place is affordable for people on a tight budget. It's an old traditional Japanese house which was converted to a guesthouse, which gives you a special cultural vibe and atmosphere. The location is quiet and close to many of Osaka's popular attractions, only being a 5 minute walk away from Japan's current tallest building Harukas 300 and a short distance from Shinsekai which is a popular entertainment district and also has a wide range of places to eat! Being close to a Don Quijote, and having a few Tamade's a couple minutes away, its a huge bonus too as with the options to choose from within the cooking facilities in the kitchen you can literally cook anything at peace house! There is also sentos  public baths all around the area at a very affordable price! There's tickets at peace house which also get you a free drink at them too!
The staff are amazing. I can't emphasize this enough. They're welcoming, courteous and polite and make you feel right at home! They will offer the guests advice on anything they may be interested in, as well as with their being a sitting area in the lounge room you can play video games, watch TV, and if you're lucky, you may even get a bite of the food that the staff cook up as they know how to create some mighty fine dishes having spent so long in Japan! They're fluent in English and Japanese which also gives the place a welcoming feeling as they can translate what other guests are saying so you can still speak with everyone! I came back this month to spend more time here as our of all the places I've travelled this year, having been to 9 different countries, this was my favourite place to stay. And I shall definitely return in the future!
Thanks for the memories guys! And if anyone doubts or is hesitant staying here because of the less positive reviews, you are missing out!!
 I stayed for one night , but I dont know about what they people mentioned about smell, I stayed in 206 and it was good, the manager Kenji is really nice and clean and the whole place gets the job done,Ill use it again for my next solo Osaka trip","Monday: Open 24 hours

Stick around the common area and just be ready to go anywhere and have fun. Great staff, especially Miyako! With great vibes and a great price! Check the board for organized events or make your own if you want others to go with you if you find something good The location of the r hostel is right next to a train station. The staff are very welcoming with conversations and ideas of places to go. When I arrived, I was immediately greeted by multiple people in the lobby asking what my plans were. The rooms were peaceful and cool. The accommodations were great. The lockers to store items away were small, but I felt safe leaving most of my belongings in my bunk. This is definitely a great stay for anyone traveling to Osaka! Its an amazing place in the heart of osaka. The staff is not from this world theyre amazing people to be around. You can realy enjoy a good and deep talk with almost all the people you meet there staff included especially the girl with the redish hair. I would recommend the place to all open minded people who wanna have a good time. Worst place I've been to in Japan so far, my bedroom ceiling was leaking just in front of my bed, the place wasn't really clean and the furniture was old and sometimes very rusty. Also you have to make your own bed which is the first for me, ive never seen that anywhere else in the world. The area doesn't feel safe neither, you will find drunk people all around the hostel at any time of the day or the night. I can't really say anything about the people working there as I almost never saw them. The only good point is that it's not too far from shinsekai and dotonbori, otherwise just try to avoid this place. I wanted a social hostel, and this is exactly what r hostel is. It was easy to meet people in the common area or even just the dorm. The bathrooms were the best I've had in a hostel, the kitchen was small but definitely enough and the staff were amazing!

I understand you can only check in at 3pm, but not being able to leave your luggage if you arrive early, it should be stated clearly prior to checking in. I understand that they even want to charge for leaving your luggage with the front desk. I will cancel my stay if I had known this, definitely won't recommend this. Very bad experience about this hostel. I booked 3 nights. I was outside of the building around 1010pm. They not allowed me check in. And They says to agoda they were waited me until 1015pm. They don't said any true thing. Bad attitude and service. Second day I come back to check in they not allowed me check in again. And asked me leave. Even i said I will contact agoda. They said not allowed At there hostel to sit and wait the respond. sooooo bad experience. visit it on August 23 , well ... i start with the location Stay Osaka Namba is located at near to everything you want tourist sites and transportation and close to many restaurants, shops, and attractions. Namba Station is just a few minute's walk away, making it easy to get around the city. The facilities offer a variety of facilities, including a shared kitchen, a laundry room, and a rooftop terrace. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and there is free Wi Fi throughout the hostel.

talking about staff the staff so friendly and helpful. They are always happy to answer questions and help guests with their needs I will mention SACHIKO she gave me a fever never forget when I arrived in Osaka I forgot my shoes Brand Nike in Tokyo in some hotel, she contacted the hotel and explained to the whole situation then ask some quistion to be sure after SACHIKO answer they said ok the shoes save until you come to pick it up, she is so kind and treat the others with a big smile a great person...SACHIKO hope you are in good health and save

Value for money Stay Osaka Namba is a great value for money. The prices are reasonable, and the hostel offers many amenities for guests.
Overall, Stay Osaka Namba is a great option for budgetminded travelers who are looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay in Osaka. Very happy with my stay. The star are very accommodating and friendly. Location is perfect! Great for solo travellers wanting some quiet time the social room is not very big Solid if you can get this cheap. Everything is clean. The common area is tiny though. They have a washing machine but no dryer. They do have a clothes line. For faster drying go to nearby laundromat Sentakukan, it'll dry it in 12  20 minutes for like 200  300.

Also if you are a rain gear man, you'll find it hard to locate a washing machine that doesn't include detergent that has bleach in it. If this is so then this is the place for you because, they have a regular washer and a clothing line to dry your water proof stuff!","Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the location is excellent, with Shin Osaka station being a 57 min walk from the hostel. This place is amazing! Very well kept and I appreciated how kind the staff are.

It is also in a really cool place.

I have not yet been in a hostel that is at the top of a building like this! You can see all of Osaka! After 6 trips to Japan I have found Shin Osaka Youth Hostel to be the best place to stay out of all the hotels and hostels in my travels. I have personally stayed at this hostel on three separate occasions. Once as a group member, once as a group leader, and once on a family vacation.

The building is off the beaten path but easy to find if looking at the map, and a short 5 minute walk from Shin Osaka Station, which gives quick access to the bullet trains, JR line local trains, and the subway. The hostel is perfect as a ""home base"" for travelers to make day trips to Kyoto, Osaka, and Hiroshima cities.

The staff are fantastic. They are friendly, accommodating, speak a little English, and always offer helpful advise and directions when I ask for help. They have helped us call a cab, print maps for sightseeing excursions, and given tips on local specialties for food and attractions.

The hostel is air conditioned, offers a laundry in both the men and women's locker rooms, has a western style shower in the locker room, and a noncoed onsen public bath in each bathroom. Locker room times are restricted to certain hours so make sure to take note.

Free WiFi is a definite plus of staying here, but you have to use it in the common areas it won't work in the guest rooms. Japanese style breakfast is available in the cafeteria for purchase and is very authentic and delicious. There is also a small selfcook kitchen guests can use off the cafeteria if you prefer to make your own food or have any dietary restrictionsallergies you need to be careful of.

I have stayed in the bunk style rooms as well as the private family room. The bunk style rooms must occasionally be shared with strangers of the same gender, but there are large lockers inside each room with personal keys for your belongings. The rooms must be vacant for cleaning during certain hours every day, so you can't hang out in the room 247, but you can use coinlockers in the main level hallway for things you'll need through the day and there is a cool manga library in the lobby where guests can sit and read Japanese comics.

The whole place is always spotless and you are given clean linens for your bedfutons when you check in, so there's no doubt that sheets are changed between visits. Security is very tight. There is a curfew when the elevator only way to get in locks and you can't come in past curfew, so make note before you leave.

The hostel also provides umbrellas to borrow and bring back while you're staying there in case you forgot to pack one, and laundry soap for only 100150 yen. They have a drink vending machine the lobby, and two smoking rooms for smokers since all the guest rooms are smokefree.

Overall you will be hard pressed to find a place with all the same amenities for the price! I highly recommend them! The location is alright since it's close to the station, there's not much to do in shinosaka, so you have to take a train to Osaka to actually see something. The rooms are alright, you get to experience sleeping on a futon not that nice though. They have Japanese bath, which is really nice, and the opening hours are alright. The big problem is that the other showers needs to be cleaned for 6 hours, which I think is a bad excuse for saving some money. So annoying if you want to sleep a bit late and you get up 10, and you have to stay at the hostel till 4pm because you smell and can't take a shower before. Also you can't get into the hostel after 12 pm, so you can't really experience Osakas nightlife, like in namba which is full of life at night. They have some weird rules also, so if you have a bit more money and want to be on a more loose leash, I would recommend not staying here. But if you're fine with going home early and waking up early, this place is a good option, since it's so close to the station. I booked just one night in this place, mainly because they lock everything from midnight to 6 am.. Around 10 am you must leave your bedroom because staff will come in and clean everything... so, if you really want to sight seeing Osaka, find another place, like I did. I ended up staying in a Airbnb apartment and it was the best decision I made.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Ken is a one of the most hospitable people Ive met in my travels, and makes sure you have everything you might need during your stay  He even lent me his bicycle as I wanted to venture to a close by gym and didnt feel like walking to and waiting for the bus!

Location is quiet but close enough to the station 7 minute walk, would definitely recommend to others. I came upon this place by complete accident, as I had to readjust plans during my trip. And what luck that I did.
I can only agree with what the other patrons have already noted. Don't be mistrusting of the all 5 review record they are all very much real and well deserved.
There is great attention to detail and I really did feel comfortable from the moment I started my short stay there.
A big thank you to the house's host, Ken! For his patience in talking to me on the occasions of sitting together and for all the care and attention he evidently puts into the guesthouse to make it the best it can be.
I'm unsure when I will be back in Osaka, but it'd be a real shame not to come back here again. Thank you for the stay!  Simply the best hostel I stayed in Japan. You have everything you need  nice kitchen, coffee, water. The common space is really charming, it has definitely nice and authentic vibes. It's very clean and tidy. The neighborhood is very interesting nice restaurants, cafes, sentos... It's really authentic, much more than around Namba or Dontonburi. I received a great welcome and the tenant is very friendly. I recommend this place  Kensan was very flexible and accommodating. I took the night bus from Tokyo and had a 10am appointment the day I arrive in Osaka. I wanted a proper bath before this, and a place to leave my luggage. I couldn't check in yet, but he considered my situation and permitted me to use the common facilities. I could've booked a 3star hotel or an apartment advertised affordably, but I'm glad I chose this place.

The room was also spacious, and the futon comfortable for a good sleep.

I especially love the ""Cow Road"" yakiniku place, nearby, an unassuming shop manned by a couple. The wagyu was soooo good for the price.

There were also two train stations nearby 7 minute and 15 minute walk.

He also had all the extra amenities that even business hotels won't have, like hair straightener, bandaid for walking a lot, Muji face and bath products, etc.

I also liked the small details of the place interiors like the Chinoiserie design sink, the industrial feels coffee cup wall, etc. Hostel Caranashi has been one of the most pleasant hostel experiences I have enjoyed. The rooms are cozy, homey, and clean. There are plenty of amenities and a convenient common room.

The host, Ken, is an absolutely lovely person and a highlight of the stay. I speak very little Japanese, and he speaks some English, but communicating was incredibly easy. He has a warm, approachable personality. His hospitality coupled with the amenities make the space feel like home.

The location is a fiveten minute walk from Imazato train station making for easy access to Osaka. The hostel is a bit far from sites like Umeda or Osaka Castle, but very near Dotonburi. The area surrounding the hostel is quiet and residential, which has been incredibly interesting and relaxing.

We unfortunately only stayed here for two nights as we are just passing through Osaka, but the next time we are here, I will come here again and hope to stay longer.","Monday: 6:00 – 11:00 PM

I am really never a person to leave reviews, especially not bad ones  but I am truly so disappointed in this hostel. I had booked this hostel for my first day of arrival in Japan, and they had written online that their check was from 1500 and on, so I figured they would have a 24hour secretary like most of the hostels Ive been staying in have had. When I arrived after my flight the light was on, but the front door was locked, I had no passcodekey, no information, no one would answer the phone, and I was left with no place to stay for the night. The next morning, after about an hour of conversing with them about the situation, I noticed that suddenly on their booking website the new time frame for checking in was edited in. No care or efforts were even considered for any means of accommodation. Just an unprofessional setting that unfortunately I would never return to. You are not allowed to enter your own room between 1100 and 1500. At 1100 they remove everyone from the rooms and you can go back in after 1500. No exceptions. They only told us about this rule after we already booked and we were not allowed to cancel for this reason.

There are lockers in the room, but the pincode is very easy. Everyone can enter your locker.

Checkin is not flexible. Before 1500, you are not allowed in and if you arrive after 2000, the staff are already gone. Very weird rules in this hostel everybody has to be out by 11am, even if staying multiple days. Cant enter the rooms again until 3pm for ""cleaning"". Place is anything but clean though... Beds uncomfortable, smelly, moldy, all around bad. Location is at Shinsaibashi near Namba. North from the Osaka tower where all the restaurants are.
There is minimum service, but overall the basic facilities are there. There is no towels, bring your own.
Rooms are large enough to sit. Only questionable is the smokealarm or the small shelf, you can bumb yourself on both things.
The capsule room is isolated enough against noises.
Cleaniness is ok, could be better. Many places overlooked. Good location but the space is too small with no elevator, very narrow spiral staircases. They also don't let you go into your room from 11am to 3pm because they are cleaning. That's definitely never happened at any other hostel I've stayed at.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Its very cheap because its self service. Even though the entrance and corridors are small, and there is no social area, the room and capsules are spaciousish and comfortable. The hostel is very clean. They clean it every day between 10 am and 3 pm and you cant access the bathroom at this time that is quite problematic check out is at 10 am and this is too early for me.

I have issues for check in. Total value for money. Would recommend to anyone. Comfortable. Had the basic needs. There was AC in the room. Good place for people on limited budget.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

They speak good English and even German. The tatami room was really big, but is not the newest room. The location is perfect for exploring Osaka. I am staying here for a couple of days and the experience is amazing. The good thing about this place is that it is close to Osaka, Umeda station, making it very convenient to travel to different places. The beds were super comfy and lots of space and warm , which was excellent after a long day of walking around the city. The staff members were very nice to all of us, they ensured that we enjoyed our time in Osaka and I must say that they did an amazing job. The best part of this place was the lounge, in there you could sit down, relax, eat, have some free tea or coffee, watch Tv. The lounge was open 24 hours. No need to check in an out daily if you are staying here consecutive days which is great.  Highly recommend staying here. BUG ALERT!!
I woke up in the middle of the night at least three times because of the itch.
I felt something on my leg, but when I tried to see what it was, nothing was there.
The day after I stayed at this nasty hotel, I had so many bug bites here and there all over me. When the cleaning guy came in to redo the bed, he didn't switch the blanket. He simply folded the used one and remade the bed like that. I was speechless, but the traveling was exhausting, and I had itineraries to catch so I couldn't waste my time and energy fighting with a guy who barely spoke English. The bug bite looks inflamed and infectious. ITS SO GROSS!!! 2 main reasons to come here  proximity to UmedaOsaka station and affordable prices. My bed was on 5th floor and the showers were on the 3rd floor which I did not appreciate at first but at least you avoid the noise when you are sleeping.
Bunks have enough space and all you need basically lamp, plug, drawer... The stay was very good. Kojisan and staff was extremely welcoming and helpful during the stay. He taught me Kanji for day related words like kyou, ashita etc. He also recommended me an Indian restaurant and a sweet shop which were impeccable. I wish them all the best.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
BONFIRE HOSTEL Osaka,"Japan, 〒558-0056 Osaka, Sumiyoshi Ward, Bandaihigashi, 1-chōme−3−１４ 森脇ビル2F",4.4,34.6213098,135.5068927,"Avoid this place!!! The room smells strongly of cigarette smoke and the owner disagreed to refund the full amount of money after this was made apparent. I had to rush to the nearby train station before it closed and book another hotel which was more expensive, this is not how I wanted to spend my stay in Osaka.

The owner seemed very friendly at first but if you book a nonsmoking room and it smells strongly like cigarette smoke which another guest also agreed with, you have to deal with the issue. But instead the owner fights tooth and nail not to issue a full refund and disputed the claims. The kitchen was also quite dirty but that's a minor detail. Avoid this place at all costs. Had the best time here. The host, Cherry, is the most amazing and welcoming person. She took us to have a Hanami under the Sakura trees and made sure we enjoyed ourselves. It's a small place so you get to make connections with the other people there. The beds were also the most comfy I've stayed at in Japan! You can use the kitchen and fridge. Shampoo and soap provided and towels are available. Extremely fast WiFi. Convenient location despite not being central. Very warm, cosy stay with a lovely host. Came to Osaka early and was allowed to leave my belongings in the private room I booked. People are friendly and respectful, we even had a small ice cream and sake party. Bed was comfy and loved the cat themed bedsheets  Arrived late and had informed the staff I would. They were amazing at communicating with me before my stay and even emailed the day I was to arrive to let me know they had my bed ready. Beds are super comfy and clean. The hostel its self is super clean. Bathroom was very clean, smelled nice, and easy to find. The sinks outside the bathroom have free to use shaving cream, hair dryers, contact solution, and Qtips. There are laundry facilities for 200 yen, towel rentals for cheap, and tooth brushes for 50yen. A very great hostel for a very good price. Just love the place, Cherry, the owner is such a beautiful soul, you won't wanna leave. The hostel is not a big one so it's good for socialising and making friends.

The place is small, and as such, some compromises are made. You have to venture outside to reach the showers for instance only when staying on ground floor. The privacy of the bottom ground floor beds aren't great, and I could've used a thicker mattress. Cleanliness is okay.

For the price and the vibe, this place is great! But if you need some more creature comforts, privacy or closer to where things happen, maybe upgrade to something a bit pricier.

Recommended. At first we booked this hostel for 3 nights, but after the first night we decided to stay for whole two weeks! The hostel is super convenient. Though it is not in the center, it is close 8 minutes walk to Shonai station so it is also easy to go to Kobe and Kyoto and meanwhile you get to stay in a quiet neighborhood, with small and cheap shops and bakeries. In the hostel itself there are 3 toiltes, 2 showers and a common area with TV, kitchen to use freely and free coffeetea. Beds are quite wide for singlebed, and you have a night stand and a lamp, and curtains for privacy. Hiro the owner is the nicest person ever!!! I have stayed in this hostel for some time. At first I was a bit apprehensive as it was my first time staying in this type of accomodation. But as soon as I arrived, I felt at home. The manager is a real nice person and the staff are all very welcoming.
The hostel is close to the train station, so you don't have to worry about getting around. The neighborhood is rather calm and you have stores and restaurants nearby.
All in all, the place is excellent. I would definitely stay again. I have loved my time here so much. The hostel is such a haven of adventure and story telling. Kikuchan was an amazing host and held the perfect amount of wisdom to guide wandering travelers. The entire neighborhood is filled with wonderful characters, and I made many friends, despite the language barrier. It's the best location to be in in my opinion, 10 min from the station 10 min from Umeda Station, 20 to Namba and Dotonbori, and 40 from Kyoto, 5 min from the Family Mart, and right across the street from a super cheap grocery store. It's hidden away from the craziness of regular tourist places and there are countless hidden gems to be found. I feel like I got the best of both worlds, tourism and the native lifestyle. I am so lucky to have found this place!! Very nice hostel! Owner very friendly and has great English. New facilities and it was very clean and a short walk from the train line only 2030 min ride from airport, cheap lines. Breakfast included, small towel provided, working kitchen area.

We stayed in both the traditional room and the hostelstyle dorm. Both areas were extremely clean and wellkept. I would wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone staying in Osaka. It felt like an incredibly authentic experience! Best experience in a guest house.
Very clean, the beds are perfect for sleep, and all of the staff are very nice.
Also the area is very chill and is next to a lot of kombinis, restaurants and supermarkets.

You can go to the Osaka Castle walking from here and hot spring baths with sauna sento that I recommend too.

Also the anbutterpan they prepare at the cafe of the house is amazing.

Thanks and I will definetly come back again when I'm in Osaka next year. Hands down the best hostel Ive stayed at in Japan. The staff were very friendly and helpful, dormitory rooms were spacious. Really relaxing spot, very quiet and safe neighborhood. I hope that I get the chance to stay here again sometime Stayed in a private room for a week during the winter. It exceeded my expectations. The room was a traditional Japanese style with tatami mats and futon beds that were super cosy. The shared shower and bathroom are outside the main house and the dorms are up a narrow staircase that can be difficult for large luggage. However, I think that this place is great if you want an authentic experience. Its located in a quiet neighbourhood less than a 5 minute walk from the subway line and multiple convenience stores. The staff were excellent, super friendly and helpful. It felt more like a homestay rather than a hostel. The cafe on the lower level also makes the best coffee I have tried in Japan.
1010, I will be staying here again if I come back to Osaka. I would highly recommend staying at this small guesthouse! I stayed at a lot of great accommodations in my trip but this was definitely my favourite. The guesthouse is very affordable and gives a more traditional Japanese atmosphere from tatami mats, to futon beds, to a small zen garden! The location with a nearby subway station also makes it very easy to go to Osaka hotspots! The staff is super friendly and they have a really great breakfast deal for guests that includes coffee, toast, salad, egg, and sausage for only 500. Highly recommended staying here!!

Enman Guest House Osaka,"7-5 Ōeda Minamimachi, Moriguchi, Osaka 570-0051, Japan",4.9,34.7312671,135.5659425,"Very beautiful and peaceful place. Perfect for backpackers needing a place to stay the night. Everything you could need is available and the staff are lovely with good recommendations for what to do around Osaka and for that time of the year. I was recommended some tranquil places to see the sakura that were less known which was amazing. They both can somewhat speak English, conversations are very easy to get across. There is a convenience store and small supermarket within a 3 minute walk as well as a train station within 5. The area is not super close to central Osaka however a 15 minute train ride over two lines will get you to Osaka station. I had zero troubles and would highly recommend for a comfortable and easy stay over a few days. Thanks to Yumi and Takeshi, I felt like it is my home. I really felt like I am living in Japan. I definitely recommend staying in Enman Guest House to meet lovely owners. You can learn a lot from them about Japanese culture and life in general.
Also the guesthouse is so clean and neighborhood is so peaceful.

One of the most special places I have ever stayed... Absolutely brilliant place to stay in Osaka if youre after a more local feel to your trip. The guest house is located close to the main attractions yet is in a suburban, local neighbourhood. The train station is a 810 min walk away. Yumi and Takeshi are very welcoming and we spent a long time talking about Japanese culture and Scuba diving. The house is super clean. I stayed in a Japanese room which was very comfortable  I love the minimalist design. Next time Im in Osaka, Id definitely stay here again. Extremely clean and quiet guesthouse with great hosts!

I spent 5 nights here in early November and it was one of the cleanest places I've stayed at during my travels around Japan. I love that each guest gets their own hand towel to use at the sink, and both hand and bath towels are swapped out for a fresh one every other day. Personally, I'm not a fan of the fuzzy toilet seat covers, but those were also washed and replaced regularly. Since I was there for some time, I saw multiple guests check out and the hosts would always thoroughly clean afterwards  futons and pillows are aired out, the place is vaccumed, sheets are changed.

There is a kitchen and living room to use, though most guests kept to themselves in the common areas. It should be noted that the room with a garden is downstairs with the common areas and is separated from the living room by a traditional sliding door. The other bedrooms are all upstairs.

Sound insulation isn't the best, but all guests during my stay were very mindful of noise.

The hosts speak English and are very friendly and helpful. I would by happy to stay here again! We stayed one week and have nothing but good things to say about our stay at Enman guest house. It's close to the city, but still very quiet. Everything is clean and tidy and you get great support from Takeshi and Yumi. The area is packed with many good restaurants which we enjoyed. Yes, now I remember one thing that was not that good and that was the shoehorn that was very short. We bought a long one so now that is not a problem anymore ","Monday: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The single room is small but well equipped. Wifi worked well for calls. Bring an eye mask as the light from the corridor enters the room. The owner was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were spacious and very clean! Thank you very much! We stayed in double private room. Location so ideal between two stations. The place it's self is clean, bedrooms are comfortable. We had a lovely evening watching the sunset on the roof top terrace. The hostel room is small. Their one bed for two persons probably is not enough if you are Europeans. Because Europeans or Americans tend to have larger body than us Asians. Either way you should ask about the size!

However the hostel itself is clean, easy to access from major Osaka metro. You can go to Namba from this hostel only in 10 minutes through 4 stops!. Around the hostel there is a supermarket where it sells everything. Some shops, cafes own by ordinary people so you can buy cheaper.

The interior of the room that we rented other than single bed, is small table with mini fridge, a set of toilet and shower. No ofuro bath tub. Although you can walk not far to get public bath house according to the receptionist.

The check in and check out is very easy. Convenient. You only need to inform for check in. For check out you can just leave the key on the receptionist desk. Other facilities are hotcold water in dispenser, microwave to heat your food.

The price is not expensive consider its strategic location to the center of osaka such as dotonbori, namba and osaka station. It is also close enough to the train for Osaka international airport. If you visit Osaka but you want to easy to go to airport. You should stay at this hostel. We had a great and comfortable stay. The interior is stylish and reminds of a boutique hotel.

The place was very clean, and it's smack in a super convenient spot. My room and the whole house had everything to keep me comfortable. The staff? Super friendly and nice. Honestly, I doubt you'll get this kinda service in other shared houses or even hotels I've crashed in. Honestly, I will recommend it for everyone and my friends when they visit Osaka. You get a really decent private room for the price you pay the cheapest I've seen for a single room, clean place with a washing machine available, a kitchen with utensils and a friendly owner.
Only downside is the location Best shared house I liked the environment and cleanliness and near station. Very clean, quiet location, helpful owner, have use of kitchen and lounge, close to convenience store and train station. A small Japanesestyle building with three private rooms on the second floor. The wooden stairs are narrow and the handrails are made of bamboo. Be careful when going up and down the stairs. It is not suitable for the elderly and children. Heavy luggage is inconvenient. If you are flying to Kansai Airport It's okay to arrive a day in advance, but because Minato is a small station, there are very few express trains. It's better to check the train schedule in advance, or transfer to ""Hagoromo"" station and then change to the express train to Kansai Airport to save time.

We chose a double room with its own bathroom. The room is on the top floor and we have the entire floor to ourselves. The price for 3 nights is only more than 6,000!

Super awesome!

The first is that the location is very convenient, whether you are going to Osaka JR Station a 10minute walk to Awarabashi Station, Nara a 10minute walk to JR Namba, or Nakanoshima a 10minute walk to the Sakuragawa Osaka Subway are very convenient. Not only that, there is also a large fresh food supermarket nearby, where you can buy everything you want to eat and drink!

Secondly, although the room is small, it is wellequipped and the bed is very good! The cozy room has a microwave, refrigerator, and TV. Although the room is a bit small, it can still maintain the quality of life very well. There is also a bathtub in the bathroom for taking a bath! The key point is that the bed here is so nice to lie down on, you wont want to get up when you lie down...

Thirdly, the boss is very attentive in serving us. He can speak a little English and is afraid that we will not understand. He has prepared a prerecorded translator in advance to let us know the room rules and how to use the room card. In addition, the boss personally escorted guests to the door when we checked out, which was really super considerate!

The place is kept clean and tidy and is located near a subway line ans only 1.5km from the closest JR line if you have the pass. Will come back for sure! Pretty nice ambience. Location is also about a 1 minute walk to Sakuragawa Station, a post office, multiple convenience stores, a ramen shop, and a laundromatonsen. Just be aware it can get noisy. Will update my review after my stay.
The host Alex is very friendly and helpful.

My room was on the 5th floor there's no lift. The showers and toilets are on the 2nd floor. This place is good. They have a small bar, that locals occasionally come. An they are eagerly chat with you. If you are a foreigner, wanting to make some Japanese friends, this is a right place to go. Excellent for a solo traveller like me. The host are very very warm and helpful. I was having bag difficulty at the airport and He waited for me for a late checkout. I arrived an hour before the checkin time but made a note in AirBnB. The host didn't read my note Nd was surprised I was early. The two stars is because they are disorganized and the place wasn't the cleanest. They do not have rules regarding lights off or guests calls or any kind of noise control during late hours, 11 pm onwards. There is no sound proofing and most things were cheap and no heater. It was cold and the windows were open. And because there was a bar below the music was loud and you could hear it as it was a floor below. The place is not maintained well and I would not recommend. It has been the worst guest house I've been to in all of my stay in Japan so far.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The communal dinners are super tasty and healthy, a nice break from eating out all the time we even had handmade udon one night. Sometimes youll even get live music from the staff or from a neighbor stopping by. Its close to the subway as well as lots of little local restaurants and tiny karaoke bars. I felt like I got a real taste of local life in Osaka by staying here. Unique hostel that doubles as a cafe, shop, meeting area and community center. For 1100 yen one can join in on dinner or breakfast, which is homemade with the help of those around. You might be asked to help out if you decide to join. The shared rooms and facilities were clean. The location is in a somewhat poorer district and rather unique due to the occasional  female barker at night and the location of the red light district nearby. Both are easily avoided however. Crazy colourful community space, with good art works and artists. You can eat a fixed meal with community members. Room comfortable and clean. Great hospitality by the senior poet Kanayosan who is behind this art initiative Great community, Nothing like the rest of the hostels around the Area of osaka in the absolute best Way This guest house is for people who are looking for interacting with people from local community, the other guest and staffs while staying in Osaka.

Great rooms for a great price. Cute cat in the lobby and lots of manga you can read freely. Closeby a convenience store and public transport. Recommended! Love you ! Adorable cat, fun atmosphere, I feel like I spoiled the mood by doing homework instead of enjoying the moment. The cat is very cute and very chill, be kind and he will love you. The beds are comfy and clean. The rooms are air conditioned and plenty of amenities on tap. I don't know if we went during a low capacity time but my 6 person room only had 1 other visitor.

In our room we were greeted by many many strands of hair, that clearly didn't belong to us, and a lot of stains allover the bathroom  including several pieces of hair on the toilet seat and brown stains under it. We immediately contacted the manager, sent photos, and they said they would send someone to clean the next day. it was after 11pm when we checked in

When we got back around 11 pm the next day, it became immediately clear that nothing had be cleaned. Even the same long pieces of hair were in the exact same, very very obvious place on the outside of the bathtub. I contacted the manager again and expressed my confusion  they claimed the place had been cleaned completely ignoring the new photos I sent, which prove the opposite and then stopped replying completely. We cleaned the disgusting toilet and tub so we would finally feel comfortable using it.

We paid almost 12.000 for two nights in a weekend  so not exactly ""dirt cheap"".

I did not receive any kind of compensation. I do not recommend this place to anyone. I'm unsure whether they ever actually clean and the rude and dishonest behavior of the manager is incredibly offputting.

Dirty. Firstly, I was skeptical to book because of some negative reviews on here and google map. However, I decided to just go for it anyway because of the price and location.

When I arrived at the property, I met the host immediately after 30 secs of ringing the bell. He was friendly and welcoming even though his english wasnt fluent.

He took care of us and even let us check in earlier because the room was ready! The room itself was comfortable and perfect for our group of three! We each had our own bed, a nightlight such a thoughtful attribute which I love.

Our bathroom and shower room was shared but they are ALWAYS clean. The shower water pressure is to die for and water temperature is perfect. What a great relaxation after a day out exploring!

Yes, the lobby is a little bit messy but Im sure the host can tidy them up easily. I hope they will tidy up the lobby area and make it more aesthetically pleasing when a guest enter. That will make a great first impression.

AC was cool which is perfect in this summer heat. Bed was comfortable and perfect. An added bonus was the outlet by our bed, perfect for charging our phones! This is by far our favorite inn in Osaka. They even let us place our bags in the lobby after check out. Just make sure to check out on time!

All in all, if you're checking this review, I hope you do not hestitate to book. We feel so comfortable in it so much so that my family ask to rebook it for another night during our second stop in Osaka  Thank you so much for an amazing stay. There's a family room though the inn caters for dormitories male and female separated. The family room has 2 bunk beds which are just OK for me. The amenities are always available outside the room. Food is not to be taken inside the room and there's also a coin laundry for us to do our washing. The location is very strategic. There are Sakaisuji Line for local and Nankai Line for both local and direct to KIX airport. The place gets really quiet by 7.00 pm but it's safe to walk around the neighbourhood or to the nearest konbini. I don't want to give even 1 star.
In a word, it was the worst.
I tried to check in at a selfcheckin hotel, but the room I thought I had booked was not available, and when I called the listed phone number, there was no one there.
Even though I had paid for the hotel in advance, I had no choice but to give up on staying at this hotel and look for another hotel.
There was no contact from the hotel the next day, and even when I contacted them, there was no apology. I can't say anything about refunds because the person in charge is different from start to finish. One point tension. It was unpleasant.
The hotel itself is not wellmaintained and cannot be recommended. It is a 3minute walk near the Tenxia Chaya subway station and Sayuri BB. It is a breakfast shop with a high CP value. It is a small shop where many local elders come to dine consider those who do not accept the smell of cigarettes. The service girl is very friendly. Very patient in explaining the meals! We ordered a total of four different combination meals. The DM pictures are consistent with the actual photos. The price range is 450550 yen. After eating, the comments said they were delicious.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Situated next to a convenience store with global ATM Visa, Master, Maestro... and only 3 min. to nearest subway station. Dotombori can be reached by foot in 20 min and 510 min. by bicycle which can be rented at the hostel.

Stayed for 8 nights, it was a great hostel experience, one of the best I ever had.

Enjoy! Good location, just a few minutes from the nearest metro station. The guest house is super new and modern common areas are well designed and furnished. Everything was absolutely clean. I stayed in the mixed dormitory, the capsule bed is comfortable and there's a lot of space.
The staff was extremely friendly. They speak japanese, chinese, english and italian!
I definitely recommend One World for a stay in Osaka! The hostel is very clean, comfortable and wellequipped. Its located in the city centre, just between the interesting areas of Umeda and Namba. The main touristic attractions are easily reachable by walk or by bike and the nearest metro station Sakaisujihonmachi is about a 3 minute walk.
We stayed in the mixed dormitory, its well organised and ensure your own privacy and the bed are very comfortable.
The kind international staff has been able to give us all the information we needed to enjoy the city.
I can definitely say that One world Osaka hostels is one of the best hostels we have been during our Japan tour. Very clean hostel and helpful staff. Too clean! ","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The negative part was you have to leave the house before 930am and come back after 300pm every single day. I stayed for 7 days and this schedule made me feel kinda like working days rather than vacation. Also the bed was really hard, felt like I was sleeping directly on the bed board.

It is a nice place to crash if you have limited budget but if you wanna chill and enjoy the vacation I personally wouldnt recommend here. The owners really took care of me.  Allowing me to leave my bags there for an extra day at no charge.   They even gave me a present.    Its a nice place to stay for those on a budget. Very nice old lady runs the place. comfortable floor mats and pillows. I had the whole place to myself when I was there. I had missed my flight and was at a loss as all the hotels were fully booked due to the holidays, but the owner asked me about the situation, and with his kindness, I was able to stay there on short notice. During my stay, I heard various stories from the owner, which was very powerful and energizing  I will definitely visit again when I come to Osaka! Thank you very much for your help! The lady was very unfriendly when we arrived, even though it had been clarified beforehand that we wouldn't be there until around 11 p.m. and she replied that it wasn't a problem.
In addition, you were no longer allowed to shower after 11 p.m. and the bedding smelled of urine.
At 5 a.m. the lady started talking loudly on the phone and preparing something in the kitchen.
At 9 a.m. the curtain on our beds was simply pulled up without any prior notice.

We were also told that we had to leave the house at 930 a.m. and not come back before 3 p.m.!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

It was a bit difficult for me to see at first, but just look for the small ""Welcome"" sign and the Auberge du Tanuki Noir sign at the top of the building.

All areas are kept clean and smelling good.  Mathieu is a great host that's available throughout the day if you need anything. I'd recommend having the app you used to book the hotel installed on your phone, to keep in contact if needed.   I met guests from multiple different nationalities and enjoyed talking to them throughout my stay.  I was able to do laundry at a place 4 minutes away make sure to Google translate ""coin laundry"" into Japanese, and then put it into Google maps to easily find a location.

It's close to Bentencho station which is on the JR Osaka Loop Line if you need to go anywhere. Very nice Place. We stayed for a week and had a very pleasant time.
The rooms and common rooms are kept clean at all times and the host is very courteous.
The hostel is only a 5 minute walk from a well connected JR station.
Overall a very pleasant experience. Small guesthouse close to the Loopline. Very affordable. The place is very well maintained, everything looks new and it was very clean.
Breakfast was also very good for the price.
Definitely recommended. Great owner, love the vibe and its very clean and well kept. Perfect place for someone traveling around Japan solo or with a partner. Recommended to anyone Absolutely wonderful! 1010 recommend","Monday: 7:00 AM – 12:00 AM

NICO HOTEL,"2-chōme-16-11 Kawarayamachi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0066, Japan",4.5,34.6700247,135.5114243,"This is not a hotel. Its an Airbnb acting like a hotel. No amenities and you have to take out your own trash. There is nothing to put clothes or items on but a very small coffee table in the room. No shelves or other tables etc One room has AC but the bathroom does not have AC so super hot. The staff was friendly and the bed was comfy but everything else about this place was not impressive. I would not stay here again. Oh, and its a pretty good walk to the subway.

Edit There was no complaint prior, we wanted to stay another night in Osaka and the hotel said the room was already booked, we didnt want to have to store our luggage just to move rooms, another amenity the hotel dont offer baggage service, so we tried to cancel our 2 night stay so we could change to a 3 night stay  very glad it didnt work out. While this hotel is more like an airbnb, it is an amazing place for the price. When the staff are available, they are extremely helpful and have great recommendations. The room was also perfect, even though the bathroom is small, it's functional with nice bidet, but the tub was a joke lol, i'm 6'2. I booked the balcony studio with a kitchen and washing machine, which came in handy. I was pleasantly surprised, and it's in a great location close to the fun but not too close that you hear noise. I will be returning as this place has everything, and the kitchen comes stocked with supplies and a microwave. It felt like I was back home! I booked a sixbed room for my family 2 adults and 3 kids really nice family room with a nice round table and 4 chairs.And at a very good price. Staff was the most friendly Ive met in the 4 weeks in Japan. 510 minute walk from Dontonbori streets. In my opinion one of the best places in Osaka. If I go to Osaka again I would most likely use NICO again. This is a lovely hotel to stay in, although has issues. The rooms were large and nice with a convient washerdryer in the room. The dryer function was essentially spin only so you had to hang dry your clothes. The self check in was the most involved check in I have ever done and absolutely had staff present. The reason I dropped the star rating was because they made you take out your own trash at the end of your stay, which is not correlated with a 5 star hotel We decided on NICO Hotel for its affordability and location. Here are the pros and cons

Pros
 quite affordable
 close to city centre
 comfy bed
 spacious
 small apartment, not just hotel room
 washing machine in the apartment
 balcony
 special setting to heat up the bathroom

Neutral
 no metro station in the area  whether you choose to walk or get the metro, travel time to the city centre is the same at around 2123 min
 nice to wash your clothes, but not many options to dry them no dedicated indoor dryer, your only option is balcony which is questionable when it rains
 kitchen with stove and microwave dishes included  I didn't come to Japan to cook, but this may be a plus for some
 no room service  you have to take out your own trash and vacuum the carpets with included vacuum not a big deal for me, might be bothersome to others

Cons
 noise  balcony door is facing a main 4lane road which is busy even at night you can hear the traffic clearly, might be a problem for people who need complete silence to fall asleep
 temperature isolation  balcony door is not sealed well, the outside air slips through noticeably same goes for the entrance door and bathroomkitchen area  was really cold late March
 little storage  for the available space there is not enough storage for clothes  only 1 little hanger in the room was not enough for us, I'd like to have some shelves in the room no hangers for jackets in the hall

Overall the apartments are quite spacious for the price, but I wouldn't recommend this place during extreme seasons such as winter or summer unless you're OK to sleep with the AC through the night.","Monday: Open 24 hours

No towels, no breakfastdinner unless you reserve well ahead. I had stayed at this Youth Hostel back in Jan 2008.
I'd have written this review sooner, but haven't had the time to until now.

I stayed here for about three or so weeks while in Osaka and have got to say that I adore this hostel, the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and the hostel itself is quaint, comfortable and the area that it's based in is amazing!  ..

I plan to revisit this place when I'm next back in Japan.

Kindest regards, Gordon M  .. Very nice hostel with really nice staff. Clean and cheap, the bathrooms are japanese style and very beautiful. Really friendly people and good facilities.

Jakotel Tsuruhashi,"4-chōme-3-4 Tsuruhashi, Ikuno Ward, Osaka, 544-0031, Japan",3.6,34.6649578,135.5374268,"Self check in is possible, and you dont need to call the staff, even if they are not around follow the instructions on the door and see your reservation for room number. Upon check in, no staff was around, and you've to call the number provided during reservation, which is costly if you're on roaming, since it's not a What'sApp number. During checkout, same thing happens, nobody around. Otherwise, place was clean, although toilets and bathroom are super cold in winter as air conditioner wasn't strong enough to heat up the whole floor. Kitchen facilities are complete, you can cook with the gas cooker and eat with the plates or bowls and utensils provided. However the mattress provided is so thin you're basically sleeping on the hard plastic sheet acting as the base of the bed. The only consolation seems to be the rarely provided item in other guesthouses, an electric blanket, although I find it too warm. You can use the face towel in the living room once a day.

The washing machine is located outside the front door.
There was detergent, but we cannot guarantee that there will always be enough left. m m

The bath has body soap, shampoo and conditioner. The pump bottle is full

The room has air conditioning and a nice fridgefreezer.

The bed, as you can see in the photo, looked like a cot that folded up, and when I woke up in the morning, my spine hurt a little.

The stairs leading to the second floor are quite steep, so there is a risk of falling if you lift your suitcase up.

All cooking utensils are available.

It is far from the station. The only regret is that it is a bit far from Tsuruhashi Station, but the various infrastructure makes up for it, making it a great place.

There is Tsuruhashi Traditional Market nearby, so you can use delicious Korean food they have everything, restaurants, and shops sold at stores run by Zainichi Korean residents in Japan. There is a famous hot spring near the accommodation, and a convenience store Lawson right in front of the hot spring.

The owner and staff are all friendly, and at a reasonable price, the hotel is wellequipped with electric blankets, electric heaters, and instantaneous water heaters to help you prepare for the Japanese winter, which lacks heating facilities. The owner also operates the currency exchange booth on the left of the photo, so the feedback is very quick.

The first floor has two public bathrooms one for men and one for women, a sink and a bathtub, cooking utensils for light cooking microwave, rice cooker, gas range, refrigerator, electric kettle, etc., and a washing machine. Available.

This accommodation is based on a basic Japanese house. There are a total of 3 rooms 1 on the 1st floor and 2 on the 2nd floor 3person male and female rooms. There is also a small veranda for drying laundry on the second floor. Above all, it was interesting because it was a guest house and I could meet a variety of people.

I highly recommend it if you are planning to visit Osaka with a small group family, friends.

For smokers, there was a separate smoking area in front of the door and on the second floor veranda, which was very convenient for smokers.

It was a cozy, costeffective accommodation that I would like to visit again. The photo is a panoramic view of the neighborhood taken right in front of the accommodation. I also remember the drinks I drank from the vending machine in the small park right in front when I left and returned to the accommodation. It's cheap and helpful. It's pretty deserted, but you can easily get in touch with Booking.com, and they'll come right next door. I tend to get locked in the toilet next to the bath. It's a little far from the station, so it's recommended for people who don't mind walking.","Monday: Open 24 hours

You will learn about Osaka. It's definitely here considering the location, price, people. very very good i like here These are two country guys who stayed for 4 days in a row.
1 subway stop to Dotonbori close
Near the market, 10 minutes from Kansai Airport subway station
The location was really good.

If you drank a lot the day before, there is a public bathhouse right next to the accommodation. Outdoor openair bath? spa? If you go in there, your hangover will go away right away. On your way out, try the white milk at the counter. Bath  towel 500 yen? Highly recommended

The owner is really kind. He recommends good restaurants and tells you a lot about various things.
I've been to a lot of guesthouses, but the beds are still good. The inside is also clean. If I go to Osaka again, I think I will visit again. Stay healthy always, boss, you're the best I made a reservation for 4 nights at Maru House, run by a Korean owner, through the Minda site.

Maru House is located in front of Tsutenkaku in Shinsekai, so I was able to wander around Shinsekai and see Tsutenkaku every day.
It's not right in front of the station, but there are a few stations nearby, so it was good for moving to other places.

Although I traveled alone, I was able to hang out with other guests under the leadership of the owner, so I wasn't bored.
I had a lot of fun with the owner of Maru House and had a great time each time.
The owner said he would only run the business for 3 more years due to physical constraints, but I hope he will run it longer than that.

I used a bunk bed in a dormitory room, and the mattress was really soft.
When you lie down in bed, half of your body touches the mattress.
The owner said he laid down two mattresses.

One towel is provided per night, and it is more than twice the size of a regular towel, and although it looks used, it has been washed well and smells good and is soft.

The owner knows good restaurants near the accommodation and even eats out with the guests.
I was able to eat delicious sushi and sushi at the place you mentioned. While looking for accommodation, I thought it would be scary to sleep alone as it was my first time traveling abroad alone, so I looked for a guest house..!! I was worried in the summer that it might be a bit far from Dotonbori, but the subway was good and I could walk without any problems ",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

I guess the host keens to make the room something crazy. It was my first time that a computer moniter and a printer were available in Airbnb house. Since an Internet connection was super fast, I can recommend here for a business trip as well. Some interior goods were also interested. Japanese traditional things, strange shape of lamps, quaint clocks,,, you'll want to put them on your FB or IG. A lot of room have many heaters so I've never felt cold in each room.

Close enough to train lines that travelling around Osaka was easy but far enough away that every night was peaceful.

I couldn't recommend Japaku highly enough and will definitely look to go back for my next visit. The place is huge for four people, really worth the price. There's alot of utility stuff u can use that are free. Eg washing machine, dryer, ironing board. The place is clean and spacious. Location is not in central osaka though so not as good for tourist but I still feel that it is convenient as it is near the train station and doesn't take more than 30minutes to reach dotonburi I would love to stay here again, nice quite area, family friendly, 5min walk from train station, a bunch of good food in walking distance, small shopping center at station.

It's also quite near some restaurants and convenience stores. However, the rooms are a little difficult to get to because of the narrow stairway. The common areas are also not as new or clean as the official photos. Room and sheets weren't very clean

Owners response
We clean the room and sheets after every guest check out, this is simply our daily routine, if you really had unclean sheets or an unclean room you could have easily informed us and we would have remedied this situation imediately but we had received no such contact... so forgive us if we are doubtful about your review

My response
Shouldnt have to ask for clean sheets... Pictures of of the rooms are very misleading possibly from when the Airbnb first opened. Found a nice hotel notfar away for cheaper. Glad I only stayed one night. Clean little dust under the bed. The service was all done through airbnb and it looks more like a selfservice hotel. I would have liked ptobably more info or attention of how to use the trains and sorroundings cause I got lost several times. Roommates helped alot. Great room and common room besides of shady entrance. But the common room really cold, i couldn't chill in common room for too long. Absolutely great place to stay in osaka","Monday: Open 24 hours

We found that the low ceilings and oldness of the house lost their charm very quick. Overall, not bad for the price. The house is incredibly dark because everything is painted black. The bathroom was incredible and was the best thing about the place. If you have ever wanted to stay in a old Japanese house, this place is for you. A fun experience for sure, but probably won't return. Stayed here for 3 nights.
Disappointing stay  this place needs some maintenance. Lots of holes in walls and ceiling, things falling apart. Very low quality for the price. A shame.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Guest House SORA,"13-20 Karahorichō, Tennoji Ward, Osaka, 543-0012, Japan",4,34.6748697,135.526685,"This place is a good place to stay for a few nights. When I first stayed there, it had a nice layout, with a good shower room and toilet. The only negatives are the small steps which is something I have seen in many Japanese Guest Houses, the creaky bed, and its location, as it takes 10 minutes to reach the nearby JR Station. Checkin is confusing. After making a reservation online, you must first check in online input personal information for each guest the day before via a separate email from the management company, and only after the management confirms the checkin method automatic checkin. lock number.
However, this time, I didn't receive the first email until the day of the flight, so it took me a long time to check in.

Here are some things that made me a little suspicious.

 Are there two or three management companies?
There were two contact details on the reservation site and one onsite, and I ended up calling all of them due to a problem, but one said, This is not my property,'' and the other said, I am directly managing the property.'' The management system was complicated, and I think there were some misunderstandings about emails because of this.

I think it can't be helped since it's a guesthouse where a lot of different people stay, but I was a little scared of having to enter everyone's personal information down to the last detail.

The rooms are clean and cute, the location is good, and above all, it's cheap, so I think it's a very nice inn as long as you check in properly. It's hard to find if you look for it at night  The room is small but new. I think it's enough for 3 or 4 people as it's cheap. The stairs are steep so it can be difficult if you have a lot of luggage.  ","Monday: 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM

Host
Mariko san  Hiroyuki san are the most wonderful hosts I've had the pleasure to meet throughout all my AirBnb travels. They are kind, supportive, responsive, and have set the highest goals to make their Guests feel welcomed. Because of their expertise, helpfulness, and high standards, they provide an absolute unforgettable experience.

Cleanliness
Spotless. Upon arrival, I was not able to find a spec of dust anywhere!  Every nook and cranny were immaculately clean.

ConvenienceLocation
I was literally..
15 seconds walk away from a 24 Hour 100Yen vending machine.
 5 Minutes walk West Turn right to a 24 Hour 711 Convenience store, has essentials, alcohol, wine, snacks, desserts.. OR 6 Minutes walk to a Family Mart.
 10 minutes walk East Turn Left to Shwach Station
 Shwach Station to Tennoji was a 3 Minutes ride. Or sometimes I'd walk or bike to Tennoji park.
 right beside Shwach Station is a major supermarket Life, plus a 2 level ""drugstore"" has everything from shampoo, to detergent to cosmetic to cleansers to first aid, etc
 Restaurants of all cuisine are everywhere within walking radius, from Yakinuki Grilled meat, Izakaya Skewers, Okonomiyaki Japanese pancake, Takoyaki stands Osaka famous, Sushi, Traditional Cafe, Bakeries, Tapas, Pizza, Curry and the list goes on..
 The station connects well to any other major destinations, including Dotonbori, Osaka Castle, etc. Transferring at Tennoji Station can bring you directly to Nara, Kyoto and such.

The layout was perfect, with a separate bedroom for the children and a combined bedroomliving room for the parents. Although the space is a bit small and the air conditioner struggles to cool the house quickly, that doesn't overshadow its many positives it's familyfriendly, conveniently located near Imazato subway station, and there's a very close supermarket. The house has a balcony for drying laundry there is a washing machine. The toilet and shower room were clean and fully functional. The owner was also efficient in providing advice and assistance via messages. All booking and checkin processes were handled via messages or apps, and we never encountered anyone during our stay. Although it seemed a little strange not to have any facetoface interaction from checkin to checkout, it seems that such impersonal way is becoming trendy. I recommend this house

There were no oldstyle cafes in the Minami area, so I was looking for one and ended up having a mom's meetup at this place that had just opened.
There seem to be rooms with various concepts, but this time is the best? The room had a large home theater, but since it was a twostory building, the kids had a lot of fun, and we were able to have fun without worrying about the people around us!
In this day and age, if you're in a large group with children, you're likely to be turned away, so you don't have to worry about renting a space, so I highly recommend it! !

The location is great very near to Hanazonocho Station and easy access to town.
The price is reasonable too and the house has a lot of useful equipment for living such as coffee maker, plate ,hot bathtub and cooking stove.
It even have big TV that have Netflix to watch that impress me very much. the heater is great for the cold weather. The checkin process is very simple and easy.
The supermarket is insanely near to the house almost 3 step in front of the house so it good for make breakfast by yourself and the price is very cheap. It make you feel like stay in a sweet home and the house have very nice smell. It have a wood aroma that make you feel more calm and relax. I am very recommended to stay here again for a good experience in this modern Japanese lovely house.

The house has 7 person max capacity but has only 1 toilet so it would be take some time for a lots people to finish taking a shower but it's fine for me because this trip we only have 2 traveler.
The con of this house location is the atmosphere of surround area is not quite well especially ShinImamiya Station that will make feel discomfort walking around this area but I recommend you to avoid from ShinImamiya Station area and take Hanazonocho Station instead even though it will take time more to access in some areas. A cozy home in a neighborhood far from the center but very quiet and safe. Close to shopping centers, restaurants and subways. It has everything you need to spend a few days at home.

Although it's only two stops from the city center, you can get to Namba Dotonbori in less than 10 minutes than you think, and from Tsuruhashi Station, which is a nearby station, you can also get to Kobe, Nara, and Kyoto. It was very convenient because there are lines that take you there right away. More than anything, there was a handsome owner who was very kind and gave me a lot of useful information that only locals would know and helped me with various things, so I had a very comfortable visit! Next time I come to Osaka, I will come again!! I usually don't write reviews, but I would 100 revisit this place hahaha. I booked, I paid, the hotel confirmed the booking. 1 day later the hotel informed me that the price was incorrect. I would have to cancel and book again at the higher price. An absolute disgrace. The hotel makes a mistake and I as a guest should correct it. If I could give 0 stars, I would! I booked a room through Booking and the order was confirmed, but the owner wrote a letter saying that the price was wrong and asked to cancel the reservation. It was an unpleasant booking experience.

I made a booking here 1.5 months in advance and received confirmation for it. The day before my booking they said I hadnt paid for my room so theyll cancel if I didnt pay. I used the same website to book 3 other hotels in Japan and they all accepted the payment just fine. Its just these guys were having a problem and waited last minute to tell me. They told me I had to pay through a special link that theyd send to my email and I was okay with that. But they never sent me the link, and stopped responding to my messages. I showed up to the hotel at my check in time and no one was at the front desk, I had to book a lastminute hotel elsewhere. This hotel was my longest stay in Japan and it was really hard to find anything lastminute with the same amenities and price range. Avoid them if you can Located not to far from a station that has direct transit  to Dotonbori , and very easy to get to the aquarium or Osaka castle , overall enjoyed the room, and the privacy, everything was clean and well kept , just wished it had a microwave but thats my only negative. Ended up booking again since I chose to stay in Osaka a lil bit longer I'd like to be fair, but really my experince in this  place was severly disapointing..
Should read all the comments to be aware of what happening Not bad. Even I knew that this is not a traditional hotel there is not a front desk or staff in site I wanted to try. The rooms are nice with all the necessary stuff to sleep and have a good time. If there is no problem everything is perfect, but when a problem comes, there is no one that can actually help. Also, the two times that I have been in this hotel, they had sent me the code to unlock the door after I'm already outside waiting after the check in time, they initial mail says that they sent it at 11 am the day of check in, but in my experience this is not true.

We stayed here last minute booking as our previous booking at another lodging service fell apart.
The beds were very comfortable. There were  2 pillows per a person. and bed linens are very clean and crisp. The large rainfall showerhead bathroom was a nice change compared to small compact traditional bathroom showers that looked like being designed for 5' tall people only.
The sofa was very comfortable and offered fast Wifi for the room. Some wall outlets included USB port as well.

The staffhost at Namba Hara Apartement was very prompt and communicated clearly in English. This apartment literally saved our last few days of 2week Japan vacation. I would definitely stay at this apartment over a hotel if I return to Osaka. Good location. A bit old building. Thin wall.

No lobby front desk. It was difficult to find the entrance, but when I contacted the host, they responded immediately, so it was helpful. The room was as clean as a new one.

Thank you. I stayed with a friend. The location was very convenient as it was right next to JR Namba Station and you could walk to Amemura and Shinsaibashi. Security was very good as the entrance could be opened with a PIN code. Amenities such as towels and shampoo were also very good, and the shampoos were organic and very nice. The owner was also very nice and made my trip to Osaka even better.

Located in a quiet residential area, we were able to spend a relaxing time.

I took my motherinlaw, my mother, my daughter, and my husband there, and since the bedrooms are on separate floors and the toilets are on each floor, I think they were able to spend their time there without having to worry about anything.

The amenities were amazing, with the latest beauty equipment and hair dryers, and I was impressed that I could use services such as Nintendo Switch and Amazon Prime!

I was very happy to be able to watch the video in the hot spring on the rooftop while enjoying a drink from the refrigerator provided!

It's close to the station, and in the evening you can go to a delicious izakaya in the neighborhood in about 6 minutes on foot.

The day after I stayed, I enjoyed USJ!

I was also happy with the staff's polite response to emails.
thank you very much. The overflowing charm of ""Konjakuso"" is created by a modern entertainment experience and a historical building.

At first, I was attracted to the projection mapping that I saw on Instagram that you can enjoy in the bath 
Of course it's nice, and as you can see when you look at the photos, it's also photogenic. But what I was most happy about was the charm of a private accommodation where I could spend a wonderful time with my friends.
On this day, I went out to eat dinner, but the alcohol I got at the hotel was surprisingly free
It was great to have a girls' night out where we just bought snacks and talked while playing foreign dramas on a big projector

The Tsuruhashi station was only a 5 min walk and they had a family mart only 3 minutes away. Lots of small restaurants nearby.  They had a washer and dryer in the house but also a coin laundry nearby 3 min walk which was more convenient as it was way quicker to do loads
The house was very traditional Japanese house but modern amenities. There were a total of 9 beds which was great as we had a party of 11  They had a Nintendo switch. Netflix. A big screen projector. I would definitely stay again. It was worth it This property will give you a taste of owning your own Japanese traditional style house with all the benefits of modern technology. Do note that as with any Japanese house, the walls are pretty thin, so there's virtually no sound isolation. Need an option for more stars. Great place to stay. I stayed here through a friend's introduction. It was easy to access from Tsuruhashi Station and easy to find, and there were Lawson, Family Mart, and a coin laundry on the way to the inn, making it even more convenient.

The interior design makes use of a good old private house, and the oldfashioned chest of drawers was very tasteful.
There are 8 beds, so we can accommodate a large number of people.
I was imagining a fun stay with friends, but after reading the reviews, I realized that it was also used for meetings.

It is suitable for longterm stays, and has almost everything you need for daily life, such as a drumtype washing machine, cooking utensils, cutlery, towels, and loungewear.

There are juices and local alcoholic beverages in Osaka in the refrigerator, which you can enjoy for free.
An acquaintance told me I could take some home with me, so I took what I couldn't drink.

You can fill the bath with hot water.
Although the temperature cannot be adjusted, it is enough for a relaxing soak.
Personally, I liked that the shower system was from LIXIL and the hair iron from Saronia.

The living room had game consoles like Switch, a projector, and other equipment that everyone uses on a daily basis, so it felt like I was relaxing at home.

There was also a baby bed on the 2nd floor, which I thought would be used by many people.
There is also a shower, toilet, and sink on the 2nd floor.

Personally, I liked the 2nd floor because it didn't have a lot of things.
Since many people use the 1st floor for convenience, things tend to be left in a cluttered manner.

It's close to the station and has good access, so I would love to stay here again! It's a detached house, so I didn't have to worry about the noise from the rooms next door.
The room and bathroom had a nice atmosphere, and there was a projector, so it was very comfortable.
All the drinks in the room were free, from sake to wine, which was a great hospitality!
Since it's a detached house, like a hotel, there aren't always people around, so I was wondering what to do if something happened, but I didn't have anything to say! !

Despite being selfservice, someone met us on arrival and showed us to our room. AC throughout. Trains, shops, markets, and attractions nearby. Clean. Best value for money hotel I've had so far. I highly recommend this hotel very accessible to the train stations and a lot of convenient stores, grocery and restaurants. Also the room is spacious, clean, complete with travelers essential like plates, cup, kitchenwares, and towels. Best stay  Absolutely amazing. Room is excellent. Toilet is excellent. Beds, shower, view, bedding, kitchen, AC, vibe, fridgecooker and way more is so good for the price. Stayed in two rooms with a family of 5. Owner left a nice welcome note for us. Checkin was smooth. Actually, there was no checkin at all. You get the code for the main entrance and the room numbers with their respective PIN codes  via email a few days prior to your arrival. That's it! Neighborhood is relatively quiet, yet conveniently located. A Lawson konbini and a supermarket are right across the street. Closest station is Nankai Imamiyaebisu at about 3 minutes by foot, Midosujiline subway is about a 10 min walk. You can also walk to Dotonbori within like 20 minutes. Rooms are big enough, with a bed for two people and one person, respectively. Small kitchenette, fridge, microwave, water boiler. Bathroom, toilet very clean and obviously freshly renovated. Washing machine, which includes a drying function, I believe. TV with a bunch of Japanese channels and Netflix, which we didn't use as we brought our own Chromecast. Apart from a couple of hooks and hangers no storage solution whatsoever, so you kind of have to live out of the suitcase. Which is odd, because there is definitely room for adequate furniture. All in all, totally recommended. We'd definitely come back! Pros very easy checkin if you dont mind receptionless hotels which we dont, good location for Dotonbori, huge room compared to everywhere we stayed in Tokyo. Also loved had a kitchenette  seperate toiletwet room!
Cons not totally soundproof, we could hear a baby crying through one of the nights  the mattress was very very budget.
Overall good value for money, we would stay again if doing a cheap holiday but wanted some extra space.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Kendo met us upon arrival and sat down with us to let us know about the binder of instructions, and if we had any questions. Both Kenji and his wife responded to our questions really quickly. There are instructions for use of washing machine, where to throw garbage, etc, in English. Supplies such as toilet paper, extra toothbrush and toothpaste, napkins, etc, were plenty. There is even a drawer for different types of chargers and cables. Supplies were very well thought out. Very very clean home and we had what we needed. Subwaymetro is a walking distance. 20 minutes to Dotonbori and about 40 minutes to Universal Japan. They even gave us a bike to use!

I cant say enough about these hosts. Best Airbnb we have stayed at so far. My family and I stayed here for 5 nights and loved it! The hosts were so gracious and responsive. It was extremely clean and well organized. Would definitely stay here again! We stayed with a total of 6 people 3 adults, 2 children, and 1 infant.
There were two queen beds in the Japanesestyle room, so I was able to sleep soundly in the spacious room.
There was also one double bed and one single bed, so I was able to sleep comfortably.

Also, the washroom, changing room, and bath were very spacious, so there was plenty of room even with three children.
The changing room is also spacious, so I was able to change my children's clothes after taking a bath.

The kitchen is bigger than my house.
The dining table is also large, so we were able to eat delicious takeout meals.

Also, communication with the host was smooth. I went to a sushi restaurant next to the recommended facility. It was very delicious and easy to go with children.

You won't find a hotel this spacious, clean, accommodating 6 people, and for such a cheap price.
I'm very satisfied.

thank you very much. It was very beautiful and comfortable!
I would like to use it again when staying in Osaka! Thank you very much  ",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

You need to enter everyone's name, and the person who booked the room has to record a video reading the names of everyone staying there there is no air conditioning downstairs
The photos on the Internet are actually a bit different from reality, because the actual space in the building is a bit small, and you need to enter an electronic password and there is no key
When entering the lobby downstairs, you also need to enter the password but a different password

The stairs are quite steep it will be more dangerous for children and the elderly but we got used to it
The dining table is a bit small, 4 people will be a bit crowded 
There is a washing machine attached, but the laundry detergent is almost out  so we bought it ourselves
There are trash cans in the whole room only in the kitchen, not in the bathroom or the room upstairs, which is very inconvenient... 

The advantage is that it is very close to Kuromon Market and Nihonbashi. There is also a 711 nearby.
There are also many clothes hangers  The bathroom also has a drying function The stairs are very steep. I read the reviews before checking in, but I didn't expect them to be steeper than I imagined. You can look at the photos I posted. Generally, adult slippers can only go up halfway. The other parts are slightly smaller and acceptable, but safety must be considered by guests. The room looks smaller than the picture
The service was not very good. There were some problems with the previous registration. The video recording of the ID card number made people feel very uncomfortable.

I thought.
First Cabin suggested I move to a room, so I did so, but when I realized it later, there seemed to be a significant difference in price the original room was more expensive. I was in a hurry and forgot to ask, so I failed.
The inside of the room seemed to have a good atmosphere at first glance, but I was concerned about security, and there was also a long hair that had fallen was it stuck? on the sofa.
It was helpful to be able to keep my luggage. thank you very much. The checkin counter is not in the same building as the room.

The toilet and shower room are separate.
It feels good with a fluffy shower similar to Mirable.

NyaOn is cute and very comfortable with a full kitchen and a laundry machine. It is next to the train tracks but it is not loud and the sound of the train did not interrupt our sleep at all. Thank you for a great stay! This is a hideaway guest house located 3 minutes walk from Hankyu Umeda Station and 1 minute walk from Nakazaki Station.
It's close to the station, but a little further down an alley, so the word ""hidden"" is perfect.
Once you go to the place, it's easy to get to, so it's easy to come back.
Accommodates up to 13 people.
The room was very cute and I thought it would be great for a sleepover girls' night out 
They will also lend it out during lunch hours.
If you're interested, you can try different combinations. Great location right next to Umeda Station  room with cute bed  It looks like it could be used for a girls' night out and the price is reasonable so I recommend it  The owner is also very beautiful  I used it for work.
It was very stylish and comfortable, like a luxury hotel, so I was able to work smoothly.
The host is also kind and has a very impressive smile, so why not give it a try? It's very easy to access from the station, and it's great that you can go right after visiting the cafes in Nakazakicho! !

It is a five minute walk to the Teradacho train station, a 20 minute train ride to Osaka Station. A few minutes to a great supermarket as well as a conbini. The host was nice, professional, met us and saw us off.

Without hesitation, I would stay here again and recommend the 168 Guest House to other travelers. We stayed at Vacation House Tennoji 168 for a week. The location is amazing and the space was well decorated but it was a little bit crowed with pieces of furniture that made the place very hard to move around.
The biggest problem we had and we suffered with was the smell of some rooms of the house and epically the bathrooms and it gets worse at night.
The host was very friendly and she was very helpful. If you are look for good quality of trip in Osaka and comfortable place then you can not miss out of Kiths house!

I was stay with their house with trip friends and we found the place was very homey and great for gathering too. East to access any location in Osaka and others. Nearby shop and supermarket, most important local in residential area and quiet area  Great place, very accommodating 2 minute walk to nearest grocery store and about a 4 minute walk to the train station solid location and excellent environment. The owner speaks a little Chinese and communicates very smoothly. The house is very clean and very close to the station. It takes less than five minutes to walk. The surrounding living functions are very complete. There is a mediumsized supermarket within 200 meters. Everything is available. It is convenient for shopping. It is a great accommodation.

Check in was a bit confusing, since you have to check in on a screen, then go to a machine to get the key and then to a different machine to unlock the front door. The room however was neat and clean, with all the necessary amenities, and there even was a balcony this drying set up, so you had a chance to hang your laundry out to dry. There was a station pretty close to the hotel, so if you are just in need of a bed to sleep in, this is great  but nothing really happens in this part of town unless you are looking to paying for sex. Note  as a girl walking in the red light district, don't look at the girls in the shop since they do not was you to see them, so the hide their faces I felt bad for disturbing their workplace The room my family stayed was spacious and clean. Although no one is here to serve you, you can still enjoy your stay here. Follow the instruction and you can get the room key and get into the building. The laundry is on the ground floor behind the front desk. If you dont have coins, go outside to buy a drink from the vending machine and you will get the changes for the laundry. In the lift, there is a note on the wall telling you how to get to Tennoji more quickly. If you travel backpack and you like immerse yourself into the locals lives, its a good choice. Pretty good location. Very close to red line and other stuff like coffee spots or restaurants. There's also a mega Don Quijote nearby. 4 stars because there's no house keeping and you can't get multiple towels in a day.

They are very responsive overall. View from 10th floor is awesome. The room was clean and nice. Enough space for 2.

Thehotel offers a highly recommended stay with its practical and thoughtfully designed rooms. While very clean and conveniently located, it operates as a staffless hotel, which we found to be wellmanaged, as everything was set up to run smoothly without staff assistance. The welcoming scent in the lobby was a pleasant touch each time we returned. Note that the hotel doesnt have an elevator, so if you're carrying large luggage, we recommend requesting a room on the 2nd floor for easier access. The location is excellent, very close to Shinsaibashi. Although there were no staff onsite, the response through messages was very quick. Despite the lack of an elevator, we were lucky to get a room on the second floor. We booked for three people but got a room for five, which felt like a great deal! Given the price, there's nothing to complain about. I would definitely stay here again if I have the chance. Every is good. Clean. Equipped utensils for cooking. Fridge.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THOS HOTEL TO ANYONE WHO PREFERS HUMANISTIC APPROACH. It was a struggle to get in the main door. Then another struggle to open the room door. It is all digital and humanless. FYI if your phone battery dies by the time you get to hotel for first time, please go back to airport and take return flight home. Because you are screwed up you need mobile to make this work. Luckily I was not the primary contact, so I could afford to have dead mobile. But otherwise, it was going to be long sweaty frustrating check in process.
Also, the main door digital panel has buttons description in Japanese only no option for English. So good luck! Trust me you will need the good luck many more times. Its not over yet. We were helped by an angel who came up at the same time as us and knew the language. She helped us to get in.

The room is designed very poorly.
The dining bench is shaking due to loose screws. Kitchen bins are bigger than the kitchen itself.
Bed frame is wood, lower than usual and big for the room. My son has already hit his toes 5 times in first 30 mins. The wardrobe has big wall size floating mirror ??? But why not stick on the wall so limited space to navigate through the travel bags.
TV is left on the floor with floating stand. Again, this could go on the wall mounted.
All these things are occupying the little space which needs to move around.
There is enough dust everywhere to feel yuck chandeliers, walls, bed frame is full of dust.
I have been to Tokyo and Kyoto Osaka is my 3rd stop and I am not happy with this hotel. Other hotels had reception with staff, tea, coffee, water, toiletries, daily fresh towels and simple key card to access the hotel entrance and room. None of the above tick the box for this hotel. The foyer is boiling hot, so be prepared to be cooked while fiddling around to decode the humanless system.

I do not want this place to break my wonderful experience of being in Japan so far. But this hotel does not give me vibes of Japan at all. What I have learned about Japan is all about care and consideration. Both are missing here.

I do acknowledge that this is cloud based hotel and WE COMPLETELY MISSED THAT PART WHEN BOOKING THE HOTEL. But I love my humans and their humanity. I will not come this hotel again neither will recommend to my near and dear ones. We stayed for 2 nights, the location is great between 2 subway stations. The apartment is big enough for 2 people, for 3 people it would be tight. The bathroom could be improved with an additional plastic curtain around the shower, so that it doesnt get wet. We had hot water, a kitchen, enough light and it was warm. The only problem we had keypad not accepting our password at 11 pm was solved quickly. The hotel is insufficient of information provided. If you dont try to find information, no one would care you. Even you stay for many days like 714days without requesting to change tower, no one would give you tower. You have to search in their website to fill in the form the request. There is no reception which cannot receive any parcel. It is not mentioned in my booking agent. It is more important. Please be aware this hotel style before choosing this. Even the room is very big, but the bed is very short and hard. The good point is that they have electric cooker, microwave that we can cook. And there is washing machine as well. But I would not choose again this hotel next time. It is no service. The apartment itself is very nice and spacious. We were very disappointed from 2 things in particular, somehow connected we arrived at 1400 and they were inflexible with an early check in official check in is at 1500. He didnt bother to check if the room was  maybe  already clean how it happens all over the world in any hotel. But the worst is that combined with this, its not even allowed to leave any bags, as there is no storage room. These 2 points should be improved definitely in order to have a better check in experience. Connected to this, also for the check out, it should be possible to leave the bags for the day, since the check out is at 10AM. On the other hand the cloud check in idea is nice and advanced but you might improve giving direct contact with the agent in charge directly from the room, maybe putting a tablet in the room so that if you need help, you dont need to get down on the first floor and wait for others to check in, as there is only 1 iPad. You might consider also daily cleaning and maybe put some protection in the room as there are many sharp corners around the flat. The hotel location is 850m to Umeda Station  Herbis Osaka Airport Limousine Bus Station. Once we went to Fukushima Station to top up Icoca card for the trip on next early morning to KIX, some panders try to approach us. Luckily, we ran away faster. Besides that, the police knock my brother family room  some next door rooms in the midnight to find someone else. We feel unsafe once staying in the hotel without receptionist to intervene to this situation. This is our 5th trip to Osaka, however, this is the1st hotel in Osaka which make us feel unsafe once we staying in our room.

Apart from the large room, there were many private spaces, and there was also a kitchen, so it seemed like it would be easy to stay for a long time.
I would definitely like to use it again when visiting Osaka! Tatamikotatsu! Purr is the best!

There were three of us staying in the spacious guest house, and we each had separate rooms to relax in. There was also a shower room separate from the bath, so it was easy to use without getting stuck.

There were also stylish restaurants around!
Recommended for staying in Osaka I stayed at this guesthouse when I went to Osaka!
You can also use the kitchen, so I think it's suitable for longterm stays.
I would like to use it again   Since it had a large number of rooms, it was used for community gatherings from all over the country.
living? There were books and board games available, so I felt free to use them.
I will use it again! It's a little hard to understand because it looks like a normal home and there's no name of the studio.
Inside, the first floor has a living room and kitchen. The second floor has two Japanesestyle rooms and a toilet. There was a room on the third floor that was a mix of Japanese and Western style.
If you are going to use it for photography, it may be dark unless you bring your own lighting.","Monday: Open 24 hours

MONTANA FLAT YEBISU,"2-chōme-3-2 Ebisunishi, Naniwa Ward, Osaka, 556-0003, Japan",4.5,34.6528064,135.504332,"We simply loved our stay at the hotel, the rooms were clean and decently sized for me and my sister each having its own room, having a washing machine was a big plus, everything was well explained and documented throughout the room as many electronics were in Japanese, the staff are friendly and helpful, location is perfect close to both train and metro lines, with many attractions can be reached on foot, the street is pretty quite, the balcony view is a highlight! We would definitely stay there again on our next visit ! Hopefully we would have enough time for bike riding that they also provide for free which is amazing Stayed here for 4 nights. Selfcontained flat with 3 single beds, spacious toilet and bath tub. Fully equipped kitchen induction cooker, microwave, fridge, cooking utensils provided. Washing machine  laundry detergent. Self checkin and check out was easy. There is an office with luggage forwarding service. Complimentary tea, coffee etc. Walking distance to Imamiya  station with direct express link to Kansai airport. Close to subway stations as well. Great stay! Value for money. Near to Shinsekai. Loads of restaurants around. Really nice simple flat. Service is greatmany amenities in lobby..even bikes. The location is convenient as well, daily Yamazaki is very close, theres a tram station thats walking distanceEverything youd need is just really close. There are drunkshomeless if you go towards the tower but Id label the place safe as long as you use your common sense. Would stay again its worth it. I will recommend Montana Flat Yebisu to whom want to stay a budget apartment with fully accommodated and well maintained place.

You can take NanKai Electric Railway from Kansas airport to ShinImamiya station and 700m walk to the house only 970 .

I book the European style 4Single bedroom, it have 2 room in the apartment that yon can have private space to not bother your friends.

Nearby have famous spot Tsutenkaku, you can walk to that area called shinsekai have many restaurants. Even in the midnight.

There have 2 Metro station walking distance, I like Ebisucho K17 better, you can connect to whole Osaka metro systems to everywhere. It's like a small apartment and had everything you need in it. They send you the code and direction on how to enter the hotelroom after hours. Amenities are in the lobby and self served. The office is to the left outside the lobby and there are staff there from 96. Inside the room, they have a small stove and also microwave. They even have a washing machine. You can dry your clothes in the bathroom. They have the option where the vent will blow warm air to help with the process. Each room has a small balcony where you can sit and enjoy the view of Shinsekai and the tower as they are right across the street. The hotel is only about 58 minutes from the train station and 30 minutes from Universal Studios.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Ocean通天閣,"1-chōme-10-12 Ebisuhigashi, Naniwa Ward, Osaka, 556-0002, Japan",4.5,34.653938,135.5073517,"Fantastic price, interesting location. I agree that the tablet is a bit slow to check in, but if you are patient and mildly tech savvy you will be fine.
is comfortable, clean and spacious. We had a view of Tsutenkaku tower from the balcony and enjoyed the location very much. Washing machine is a great bonus, aircon strong and cool and little kitchen great. Self check in is very cumbersome. U need to be slightly tech savvy to be able to check in. The photo recognition for my passport took almost 15 minutes.

Furthermore I have arranged for my luggage to be delivered here from my previous stay. When I asked the management, they said that they do not have such services.  Did not bother to follow up. Luckily the delivery came while I was still in the hotel room else U can imagine how much trouble I have to go through.
And I cannot arrange for onward luggage delivery to the next destination.

Everything is in the manual n U are supposed to read it.

Overall hardware is good but the human touch n the personal service is totally non existent. Lovely apartment building. Mostly for temporary stay. A lot of tourists, mostly families. Rooms are great and kept very clean. Love the bathrooms  shower room there! Very modern and new. Very quiet inside the apartments. Reasonable prices. Recommended! Good staff, massage was great discounted if you're staying at the hotel. Staff was extremely kind and almost always available. Only downside was they didn't offer room service. Convenient location.

The bathroom and toilet bowl are in two different rooms.

The bathroom water heater control can be found right next to the bathtub.

The bathroom temperature control can be found right outside the bathroom. Using the heat function, we can just hang our washed clothes in the bathroom.

No need to hand wash any clothes as there is washing machine. The hotel provided the washing powder but it has already been opened and used by previous occupant.

There are hair conditioner, shampoo and body wash. All not filled to the brim. Looks like thats the norm as we requested to refill the body wash.

Toothbrush with toothpaste, shaver, brush for combing hair, cotton buds are also provided. The packaging feels dusty.. maybe its just fabric dust.

The water pressure is strong in kitchen and toilet.

Simple cooking can be done in the kitchen as cooking equipment such as pot, pan, lids, knife, fridge etc are provided.

The aircon can be adjusted with the controller for cool or hot air.

Overall good, except that you need to wash your own bedsheet and blanket sheet.

Theres a balcony where there is a slipper and a long rod for your to dry clothes. We didnt use it because very troublesome to open the door. The weather is pretty cold here so we try not to step out to do the laundry.

Main room with aircon, two big bed, kitchen and balcony. The other room, one big bed, wardrobe area. One room with toilet bowl. One room consist of washing machine, sink, with bathroom.

The dinning chair is very flimsy.. two screws dropped from the chairs.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
YAGARA TERRACE HOUSE OSAKA,"1-chōme-7-14 Tatsumihigashi, Ikuno Ward, Osaka, 544-0014, Japan",4.3,34.6509874,135.5568048,"As of October 2024, an extremely dirty place. Upon arrival, we discovered either insects or rodent droppings all around the place with some of them on the beds. Hosts were not able to do anything with it and we had to urgently change our vacation plans to relocate to another hotel. This resulted in higher expenses and missed vacation plans. In addition to this, the level of noise at night in this place was above a chance to sleep and regardless of no smoking policy, the vent was continuously pushing cigarette smoke smell inside the unit. Avoid this place at all costs!! Lived here through Airbnb, very great place and spacious.
Only bad thing is far from Central Osaka if you wanna spend more time in the city Really enjoy my stay in Yagara Terrace House. Definitely will book my stay here again when I visit Osaka again. Very clean and organized Loved the stay","Monday: Open 24 hours
