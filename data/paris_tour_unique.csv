Le Suffren,"84 Av. de Suffren, 75015 Paris, France",4.3,48.8511726,2.3005486,"I seen lobster in the window and wanted it. I was highly disappointed when I sat down and noticed they were selling half a grilled lobster, which was small I might add, for 39 euro.

That said, I switched to the Seabass. I seen someone with it and it looked good. I also asked the waiter and he recommend. It was very good. One in our party still got the lobster and complained about the size and price. The salmon dish was also good. Last but not least one person got the French Onion soup which he said was cheesy and good as well.

As far as the atmosphere, its tight in there. Had to move a table for people to sit down. Also, the smoking sucked, as usual. A memorable experience from start to finish. We were dining as a big group, and from the moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by one the staff at the restaurant who made everyone feel welcomed, even the young ones in our party.

Service was professional and felt sincere, and they really did their best to make sure their guests felt comfortable and looked after.

The food was delicious. Everyone in our group loved the food. Beautifully seasoned and expertly executed dishes.

It was a beautiful way to end our Paris vacation and made a positive lasting impression. Will definitely be dining here again in the future. Great customer service.  The server did not rush us order and the portions were quite large.  Food quality was outstanding.  Crepe flambeed with Cointreau was delicious. Very nice place. We were not that hungry so we ordered a few smaller meals like onion soup, fish soup and Caesar salad, and everything was fresh and tasty.
I was expecting the fish soup to be a bouillon with fish parts, but it was a crme soup instead I cannot blame the restaurant for my mistake.
Caesar salad was very good but was missing some croutons.
Onion soup was tasteful, but be aware that the amount of cheese on top is huge, what makes the soup pretty salty.
The staff was extremely friendly. Very nice place  Even though its located in a very touristy area its does not feel that way at all! A lot of local people eating there which a good sign. Very friendly stuff and food is really great. We paid 60 for two for 2 course meal which is really isnt expensive!

Can definitely recommend this place!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 12:00 AM

The waiter and chef understood coeliac and also my husbands soycornseafood allergies. They said they can adjust any meal we chose to suit allergies. The menu is different each day. There were 56 starters, mains and desserts to choose from. All the food we ordered was amazing! We were just going to order mains but the mains were so good we wanted to try the desserts and the desserts were all perfect! Absolutely incredible food. Everything was delicious and prepared well. The restaurant is intimate setting with not a big amount of seats. But the food was the best thing about it  everything tasted great. We dined here on a short trip, the meal was beautiful!
The service was friendly and quick, regularly checking on our table and food.
The food itself was perfectly cooked and I rarely enjoy all course but couldnt fault any of these courses. Highly recommend, wasnt too busy and was very good overall. We had an excellent dinner, the food was very good and the service was great!
The foie gras was amazing and I had the best grilled eels in Paris. We had lunch at this place during weekdays. It was generous and delicious French cuisine with a touch of Korean flavor.","Monday: Closed

Au P'tit Grec,"68 Rue Mouffetard, 75005 Paris, France",4.5,48.8427933,2.3495547,"Dressing up your crepes every which way.  Very large portions depending on your age.  We could not finish our order in one sitting. Unfortunately,  reheating it is not the same.  The lineup at this location is constant and continuous. We were curious after walking by this location several times and decided to try it. Once you've waited patiently to get to the counter to place your order, you'll need to wait another 1015 minutes as you watch them cook it. No seating,  standing only.  Cash only and these well priced crepes will be, on average, less than 10 euros. The halal crepes are 1012 euros. Please tip, the three men on duty never stopped. Absolutely delicious.  We ate one salty one and one sweet. They were both spectacular.  They allowed us to mix ingredients that were not in the menu.

After eating both crepes,  we didn't eat anything else the whole day. A delicious crepe restaurant tucked away on Mouffetard street. Each crepe is practically big enough to feed two. We ordered one savoury and one sweet crepe, split them and were more than satisfied by the end. Our chefserver was very friendly with everyone he served. We waited no more than 10 minutes, which flew by as the surrounding area is a rich example of Paris. Wouldn't Return.

My absolute biggest regret on a 5 city 25 day trip. Probably because it can only be described as the perfect hungover feed  or my palate isn't suited for ham, cheese and potatoes.

Ham and Cheese were funky  it was a sort of off funk which I can only attribute to the ham. Portion is huge, but full of potato.
Not many words other than I tried to pick out and salvage the salad.

Pictures look nice but taste was awful. Not for me.

Cash I came on a Monday around 1120am. Thankfully there was no line. Small space with a few bar seating available. Mostly a take away shop. You can see the staffs making the crepes in advance. I ordered, La Savoyarde with no potatoes for 10 euro. The staff suggested to replace the potatoes with mushrooms which I gladly accepted. It took about 7 minutes to make my crepe.

The crepe is huge. It has so much filling inside. It can feed 2 people easily. A bit too much ham though as it was very salty. I would like to return to try their sweet crepes.","Monday: 10:30 AM – 2:00 AM

Le Petit Marché,"9 Rue de Béarn, 75003 Paris, France",4.5,48.8573383,2.3660742,"Absolutely perfect! We were seated without a reservation and the food was amazing! We will definitely be back for the duck breast as it was so tasty.

Would recommend! This is a good place for a quick weekday lunch they have lunch specials every day with lunch formula entree du jour  plat du jour at 18 euros. The plat du jour changes every day and is around 13.5 euros. Other than the lunch menu du jour, theres their regular menu with lots of options. Note that the regular menu items are not part of their lunch formulas. The dishes use fresh ingredients and generally taste hearty. Lots of people come here during their lunch breaks. Set in a beautiful neighbourhood of Paris, this cute restaurant is set on the corner with a nice terrace
The food was excellent and very good service. Price was also good for the quality
Nice selection of wines by glass or bottle
We had to wait about 10mins for a table, but it was a warm night and very busy Great food, and kind staff. Try fried shrimp for an appetizer plus duck for the main dish see photo, its absolutely fantastic. A few Asian mixes on the menu Japanese, Thai, etc. Around 2030 euros per person for lunch. What a wonderful find  we stumbled in le Petit March as we wandered around our hotels neighborhood. The energy coming from the restaurant was wonderful  we were seated within 15 minutes of arriving, without a reservation, at 830 pm. We had a delicious meal  the team was very conscientious of our glutenfree needs. The food was great  flavors were subtle but delicious. The team was so nice, too. We would recommend the asparagus with crispy pancetta and the mushroom risotto for sure! The steak was lovely  the mash potatoes definitely stood out!

GATT KOREAN CUISINE,"19 Rue d'Antin, 75002 Paris, France",4.7,48.8692054,2.3335878,"Living in the UK and frequently traveling to Europe, I can tell how hard it is to find a Korean restaurant run by Koreans. But here it is. The staff is very welcoming, the food is very well presented even with very authentic Korean cutlery metal chopsticks!. I genuinely enjoyed the entree and the main I ordered. Highly recommend 

      . One of the best and authentic korean food places in Paris!

Tried their kimchi pancake, kimchi stew and stir fried pork and they were all so delicious, very similar to what i had in Korea! Kimchi was very fermented and sour which i loved. I visited this restaurant last Sunday, and unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience. Even though it wasnt rush hour, they seemed severely understaffed, with only one server handling all the tables. Service was slow, and while the server was polite and doing his best, the chef was constantly yelling at him, even in front of customers, which made the atmosphere uncomfortable.

As for the food, it arrived late and tasted awful. It was actually stinky, and I couldnt even take more than two bites. The stew had white bubbles, which made me suspect it was old or spoiled. Overall, a very unpleasant experience. Best korean restaurant I have been so far, food is amazing, the staff are really polite and helpful,  went there twice on our holiday to Paris. And anytime I will be over , am definitely going to Gatt, just gorgeous food, a must try, don't miss the korean cocktails and the drinks. the kimchi is top notch,200 recommended Very nice experience in this restaurant, very tasty food waiters are listening to us and were able to add 3 more person to the original reservation 10 people.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 3:00 PM, 6:30 – 11:00 PM

Restaurant Shin Jung,"7 Rue Clapeyron, 75008 Paris, France",4.6,48.88133399999999,2.324151,"First of all,  the taste of the food at this restaurant is not bad. However, I do not recommend this place. The reason is simple they overcharged me without my consent.That day, after finishing my meal, I asked for the bill from the owner a gentleman, probably Korean. The bill showed 39 euros. I indicated that I wanted to pay by card, so the man brought out the payment machine. I tapped my Visa credit card on the machine. After a moment, he asked if I needed a receipt, and I said yes. I didnt pay much attention to the receipt and left with my family.After leaving the restaurant, I was organizing my things and took a closer look at the receipt. To my surprise, I noticed that he had charged me 40 euros, which was 1 euro more than the bill.I understand that some establishments might expect customers to leave a tip, but that doesnt justify him taking extra money from me without asking. Even in the U.S., where tipping is almost mandatory, its clearly shown on the bill. If this Korean owner had asked me beforehand whether I was willing to leave a tip, I might not have refused. But his decision to take a tip without my consent made me very uncomfortable.Thats why I do not recommend this restaurant at all. It made me feel that he is dishonest. If he is willing to take an extra euro from a customer's credit card without permission, how can I trust the quality of his ingredients? How can I trust that he wouldnt cut corners with the food to make more profit? At this restaurant I visited a few days ago, I met the best kimchi stew of my life! It is not a Korean food with a strange taste modified to suit the local area, but a real depth and taste of the original Korean food! The smallsized seafood green onion pancake I ate as an appetizer was also excellent. I understood why many certification stickers on the restaurant show window were attached. It will be a very valuable experience not only for Korean travelers who miss Korean food but also for French people who are curious about Korean food culture! I highly recommend it! Had dinner here after a bit of shopping. They had vegan options and were kind enough to make some swaps. A little expensive for what you get but they make up for it in service and the ambiance of the place.

 lifewithaua Absolutely AMAZING service, the food is delicious, and really reminds me of food from traditional Korean restaurants. Unlike any other Korean place in France! I would eat here every day. It was a pleasant and yummy surprise I highly recommend this restaurant for those who are looking for authentic Korean food. Everything we tried there was very good and we were finally satisfied after trying a few places nearby that claim they are Korean restaurants but couldnt make the food the way they were if they were made by Koreans. Also everyone is nice!! I will be back when I revisit Paris in the future.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 7:00 – 10:30 PM

Corn Dog Paris,"38 Pass. du Ponceau, 75002 Paris, France",4.6,48.8676244,2.3520121,"We both the normal corn dog, mozzarella corn dog and the tteokbokki. Both corn dogs were delicious, would recommend the mozzarella one though and the tteokbokki was so good I loved the large rice cakes that were used and the sauce was so yummy. Service was great, the person who served us was so lovely and spoke great English, the shop was busy but the food still came in great time and the price was all super reasonable, cheapest tteokbokki we have found in Europe! The name is corn dog paris but we ordered the Gimbap and Korean toast. The toast was okay but the Gimbap was horrible. Maybe dont order these two dishes. I recently visited Corn Dog Paris, also known as Daoul Bun Sik though I'm not entirely certain about the name.

I sampled their teokbokki, fried chicken, and their corn dogs. While I was familiar with the flavors of the teokbokki and fried chicken from other eateries, I found them to be quite good and reasonably priced. The standout for me was the fried chicken with honey and garlicit was exceptionally flavorful.

Located on a quaint street in Paris, the restaurant is a bit challenging to locate, and the space itself is cozy, making it less suitable for larger groups.

One minor suggestion would be for the establishment to refrain from seating customers near closing time, as this can inadvertently make them feel rushed. I experienced this firsthand, as staff seemed eager for us to vacate our table towards the end of the evening. Despite this, I would rate my experience at Corn Dog Paris 4 out of 5 stars, as everything else exceeded my expectations. Very good food exactly like in Korea! The owner was so nice and friendly, and even gave us service. We had gotten some side dishes but they had pork and the owner changed it without us asking and gave us more delicious food! I also had mentioned how I missed cheese tteokbokki and the owner made it for me with the cheese!! Would definitely go again when I miss Korean food. I came here to try it today and it was delicious! Its a must if you are looking for a Korean food experience. I had the teokbokki classic with ramen and cheese and it was perfect!","Monday: 12:00 – 3:30 PM, 5:30 – 8:00 PM

Great great great! food!

only downside is a bit too little space and slow service to enjoy the great great food bitter smile.

Wanna come back  It is a small place so you may wait for a while when  you come. We waited under rain about 15 mins and around 15 mins for food is ready but it's worthy. The food is really delicious and I highly recommend salads and tempura. I tried the matcha and fried rice it's really nice to combine with the food but the water is a bit hot so be careful if not you would burn your tongue. For dessert I recommend the daifuku. It's red bean mochi. Very authentic Japanese udon restaurant, the portion is quite small so make sure you add extra udon if you have better appetite. But the udon here taste just like the ones I took in Japan, and all the staffs here are Japanese. VERY Recommend Some of the best Soba Noodles and tempura we have ever had. Great lively atmosphere and friendly staff and service. Looking forward to visiting again. This is a small fastpaced udon shop! Kudos to all staff to keep this vibe going all night, speedy ordering and serving. The line doesn't go down at all! The atmosphere is so fun some people might call this stressful we finished our meal within 15mins. We had tamagoyaki and tempura udon. The tamagoyaki is not sweet and packed with flavours which surprises us. The tempura is so good! The flour batter is super light and loves the vegetable tempura as well! The udon is a bit overcooked which is expected in this environment.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:00 PM

The dishes were all flavourful, the rice was fluffy and the soups were delicious!

My favourites were the fried chicken, the soybean paste soup and the grilled pork dishes ! We chanced upon this korean restaurant just downstairs our airbnb. The food is so so good! Definitely authentic taste of Korean food. We had the soodunbu tofu soup and tteokbokki. High recommended to come try their food. Service staff was friendly and they know French, English and Korean. I went to a Korean restaurant and I was a bit disappointed with the salty and plain taste of the food.
I'm sorry. I couldn't post a good review I recommend do not missed this restaurant

Pink Mamma,"20bis Rue de Douai, 75009 Paris, France",4.7,48.8819469,2.334530899999999,"This restaurant is highly recommended for its combination of good food, attentive service, and a welcoming atmosphere that enhances the overall dining experience. Whether youre dining alone or with a group, the environment strikes a perfect balance between comfort and sophistication, making it an ideal spot for various occasions.

One of the standout items on the menu is the truffle pizza. If youre a fan of pizza or just looking to try something unique, the truffle pizza is a musttry. The blend of earthy truffle with the rich, cheesy toppings creates a mouthwatering dish that appeals to both casual diners and food enthusiasts alike. The pizza has a thin, crispy crust with just the right amount of toppings, offering a flavorful experience without being overwhelming.

Beyond pizza, the menu offers a wide variety of dishes that cater to different tastes, all prepared with quality ingredients. Service is prompt and friendly, ensuring that your needs are met efficiently. Whether youre coming for a casual meal or a special celebration, this restaurant delivers a wellrounded experience that will leave you satisfied and eager to return. Clearly, this pink building is popular, but we were able to snag a table for three on the bottom floor right away for an hour around noon on a Saturday.

Atmosphere is stunning and take the time to walk all floors to see it. Service is phenomenal and drinks and food even better.

Their Bellini is only 10 Euros and comes in a large glass filled to the top. So refreshing!

The pizza that crust, burrata, and truffle pasta were so good. My wife says the pasta is her favorite in the world. So delicious! I would definitely recommend Pink Mamma. It was a perfect anniversary dinner for my husband and I. Every dish was exceptional and such high quality. Portions were larger than expected which was great! A must visit in Paris. As an Italian by blood and frequent visitor of Italy, this place lived up to the hype. I was seated promptly at my reservation time. The meatballs were incredibly moist and tender. The truffle creme pasta was unlike anything Ive had before. Focaccia carbonara was delicious. Lastly the setting is very picturesque. Amazing all around. Ambience was perfect for conversation and enjoying. Servers were attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. Food was absolutely amazing!! Totally worth all the hype and the prices werent even bad.

Busan restaurant 부산식당,"88 Rue d'Aboukir, 75002 Paris, France",4.7,48.8679551,2.347867700000001,"It's easily the best Korean restaurant I've been to. Friendly and fast service as well as really tasty dishes. Dupbap with fried chicken and spicy sauce was great! Have been here so many times, ordered on ubereat too. I have tried almost all the popular dishes on the menu. Perfect every time, authentic korean with typical dishes that are hard to find elsewhere. Toppoki, cold noodles, fried chicken, seafood pancakes, jajangmyeon are my favourites. A bit more expensive than other korean restaurants around, yes, but you pay for the quality of food and a great service! Had dinner here with my wife tonight and was deeply disappointed. We were advised against the dishes that we actually wanted to order just because we said we don't like ""too much spicy food"", unfortunately the owner immediately assumed that we only eat no spice at all and literally forced us to order very bland and sweetened dishes, simply  pointed at pictures of 3 dishes and said ""choose now"" not to mention the relatively expensive prices. It is not worth the confusion in the reservation process where we almost ended up standing in the queue outside because they did not understand us. At the end of the dinner the owner asked us whether we liked it  when we gave him our honest opinion he exclaimed a fake laugh and just walked away.

To sum up the experience all I can say is I am better off cooking my own Korean food at home, it tastes more authentic than the food cooked by Thai and Indian kitchen staff here. Cute and family run Korean Restaurant. The daughter spoke in English so she could help us with selection. It's such a nice and warm atmosphere. Biggest disappointment since a while. The waitress took the wrong order, and brought me a pork dish instead of a chicken one. I did not realize until I went away because they made me pay extra for the dish. When I went back and asked the reason why I paid extra, I discovered that they made me eat pork when I would never eat it nor order it. They were so rude about it and refused to give in and make a gesture. The owner acted like I was lying about what I ordered and was so mean about a mistake they made and refused to own up to it. WOULD NEVER GO BACK, what a horrible way to treat customers.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 7:00 – 10:30 PM

JanTchi,"6 Rue Thérèse, 75001 Paris, France",4.4,48.86602380000001,2.3360176,"Very happy about this restaurant. It really reminded me of South Korea. Authentic food flavours, good quality food and a good variety of options. The place can be a bit crowded but the service is very good and polite. We were served more rice with no extra. All the entries were very tasty. The serve Korean beer Cass to make mekju. I would recommend it. As a korean person, was going to rate it a 3 star but had to rate them a 2 because they only gave us 4 bonchon instead of 6 like all of the other tables. When we asked for the fishcake bonchon they said they dont have that but the table next to us got it.. so.. theyre lying.
The tofu soup is BAD. not authentic at all, its just salty water with chili oil ontop.. WHO USES CHILIOIL FOR THIS DISH? what the heck.

The spicy chicken is also boneless and tastes super chalky. Very bland.

Honestly the 4 bonchon's that we did get were good  flavorful, but the main dishes are not authentic at all  lacked a bunch of the deep flavors korean dishes should have. It was perfect. Very large quantities and still steaming when the meat and noodles arrived. What a feat. It was also very quick much much quicker than your average french or even Chinese in France. Super tasty too. Highly recommend. We came around 9pm and almost did not wait yet the place was packed and some people had to wait outside after us. 33 euros for 2.large dishes. Inexpensive and fulfilling This is one of the best and legit Korean places in Paris, been going for years!! Service is fast, food is fantastic  both meals and Korean BBQ. Do expect a queue on FridaySaturday nights. One of the best Korean restaurant in Paris! I've been there several times and it's always good! Most dishes are spicy... The side dishes are good. Good atmosphere too...","Monday: 12:00 – 2:45 PM, 6:30 – 10:15 PM

The service was topnotchvery friendly and attentive staff who made sure we had everything we needed. We had an absolute blast and can't wait to come back. Highly recommended Really excellent food. Very friendly staff. Probably everything feels a bit too rushed but it is always better to get food quickly rather than wait for hours.
As for the atmosphere, get ready for a sauna it's so hot in there. And probably you feel relieved that food comes so quickly so that you can leave early.
Hence the 45 for service and atmosphere.
We have been there twice and will be back many more times for sure. I came here twice during my 2023 trip to Paris because it was that good. The service is friendly, prices are good and of course the food itself is authentic and delicious. The only con was that when I visited it was really hot and this establishment doesn't have ac. No ac  open flames  hot interior but it's still worth it for the food! Very cute place and the food was delicious! The staff was friendly. I would highly recommend checking out this place if you're craving Korean food or just wanted to try it out.

We didn't get the skewers but next time we want to try it Place was small and it got busy. I felt it was a bit overwhelming for the service. However, they were smiling and accommodating. Food was delicious especially the lamb skewers! Will be back!!","Monday: Closed

Darai,"4 bis Rue Violet, 75015 Paris, France",4.5,48.8496446,2.2947112,"Although, the Korean cuisine was not the best I ever had, when you are in Paris and are craving traditional Korean cuisine, this will do the job. In addition, the owner provided excellent service, he went out of his way to provide us with great service and he even gave us a large bottled water as part of the service, other places would charge about 3.50 euros for bottled water that size. The soup comes to the table and it is still boiling so it's a bit hot to eat. However it is so delicious. If youre a big fan of tofu and spicy I believe beef tofu soup is good for you. They have dinner set which you can have the starter and kimchi and pickles. The owner is really friendly and he offers the big bottle water freely. That is so nice of them. I came back on Sunday but unfortunately it's closed. When I travel, I always want to find a very authentic Korean food, and I found this!  I trully enjoy the staffsand owner's care and a very delicious meal set. Freshly made, served hot, great seasoning, very soft tofuu in a Kimchi Jiggae. And... really, such big amount of rice  hot soup will always be a great friend with hot and big scoop of rice. Banchan, perfectttt  The Korean owner is attentive to customers needs. Seafood Ramen was with a lot of small seafoods. The best Korean taste with French perfection. First start with super friendly owner and comfortable cozy atmosphere.  Next cute menu and very reasonable prices per potion.  Next consume one of the highlights of korean cuisine in Paris.  Location is just a short walk from the Eiffel Tower.

Seoul Toque,"54 Rue Laugier, 75017 Paris, France",4.9,48.8833581,2.2934061,"Best Korean food in Paris.
If you want to try authentic dishes that Koreans eat everyday, this is the right place. The owner chef was nice and kind to all guests. It is small restaurant, nothing fancy but definitely should try! Nice little Korean restaurant. The food is tasty and they also offer the chance to try some Korean drinks  be prepared to be surprise not your usual wine or beer but good discovery. The price is correct not expensive. Seoul Toque is the best Korean restaurant in ParisI,a Korean girl who is picky about food, verified it!! Ive been to three times during the 5 days of my Paris trip  Their food is authentic like my moms cooking. note my mom is really good at cooking  I could tell all the ingredients were so fresh while I was enjoying the perfect combinations of them. The place is small but its really cozy and the welcoming from the two chefs adds a delightful touch to the dining experience. Im eagerly looking forward to returning to Seoul Toque on my next visit to Paris! The food was very good!
And the workersowners was very friendly too! Very attentive and kind.
It is a cute little shop away from all of the bustling from the main centre of the city. Wonderful experience in this little piece of Korea. The owners are incredibly kind and the food was a small trip to Seoul.

If you are near the area, it's a cozy place to enjoy a different meal.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 7:00 – 10:00 PM

Au Petit Fer à Cheval,"30 Rue Vieille du Temple, 75004 Paris, France",4.5,48.857468,2.357606,"There are three restaurants on the same street owned by the same boss. I went to the authentic one with old bar, tiny seat with good food. Next time I will try their other restaurant that looks more spacious. I can confidently say that this restaurant is by far the best dining experience I've had in Paris. From the moment we stepped in, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome. He was not only friendly but also fun, kind, and extremely polite.

Now, onto the food. The tartare steak was simply outstanding  fresh, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned. Every bite was a delight. The dessert was a sweet conclusion to the meal, and the wine selection complemented our dishes perfectly.

Overall, I loved everything about this restaurant, from the food to the service to the atmosphere. I'm already looking forward to my next visit and highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an unforgettable dining experience in Paris. The cheese is the star  of this charming place.
The tarte tatin is really good!
The ham sandwichthe bread is perfection.
Coffee  is on point.
The ambience is transportive.
The service is NOT.
And at the end of the day no matter how much I like the rest of it, I cannot come back to a place that isnt welcoming.
There are too many places in the Marais that make you feel cared for, to come back to one that doesnt. Very average. Suggested by a friend and was disappointed. You won't be mad if you go here, but just don't set your expectations too high and it'll be fine. Don't get the duck confeit though. Very packed table setup, you're eating with strangers almost, but it's a nice patio. Food was worth a tight squeeze of a restaurant. The duck confit was crispy and moist, the beef bourguignon was rich and tender, the French onion soup was rich but not overwhelming.

The Sam Gye Tang was so fruitful and the chicken fell right off the bones!! Honestly best Sam Gye Tang Ive ever had, and Ive even had it in Korea! Amazing meal and cant wait to come back! Bravo! I accidentally deleted my previous reviews but again, I would recommend reservations for here to eat, really good and authenticgreat owner and staff! 1010 Ive been searching for a good restaurant in Paris and this one definitely hit the spot! Went for a samgyeopsal and I was definitely pleased. The banchan selection was nice and also ordered a Kimchijeon with a dope dipping sauce. To top it off, the staff were friendly and kind! Definitely recommend this joint for a nice Korean BBQ! Ill definitely be back soon. Thank you! I visited there by chance but it was fabulous! As a Korean, I can say their dishes are really authentic. Sometimes Korean restaurant outside Korea can be too westernised and easy to lose its original taste, but this restaurant has exactly same vibe, taste, and authenticity as the one in Korea. I liked not only the taste of food, but also staffs! The pork bibimbap there was really nice, also the Korean chicken wings as the starter! The server also was kind. Only drawback is that the bibimbab was a bit cold when it arrived. Anyway the food there was nice and you can go for a table of 12 people when you book quite early.

The food is outstanding  rustic, sincere and delicious. The service was faultless, and the staff were graciously forgiving with our broken French. Book as early as possible so you don't miss out! Had really high hopes for this place  maybe I didnt order the right thing but I wouldnt return. The beef rib was too tough with too much fat and tendons in it. Everything else to include the service was on par but needed more than just a few good bites from the meat. I was there with my colleagues while working in France. My friends who live there suggested me to try out steak in this restuarant. It was well made with good quality ingredients. I also ordered lamb chops too. It was juicy and tender enough. I kind of like everything about this restaurant except the fact that we were asked to leave once finished our foods as another group of people were coming in. I wished we could have more time drinking more wine and so on. Can't recommend highly enough. Friendly people who are evidently passionate about the food. We had kidneys and the entrecote both of which were cooked to perfection. Gorgeous rustic setting, with a roaring fire for the meat. Great atmosphere. Oh, and the blood sausage is superb. Had a wonderful experience here. The atmosphere is very intimate and smells amazing in there with the grill next to us. The staff was very friendly and made sure we were comfortable.  We enjoyed the duck and the t bone, which was cooked to our liking. They did check to make sure of this. The sides were just fine. Nice wine selection.","Monday: 6:00 – 11:00 PM

Dessance,"74 Rue des Archives, 75003 Paris, France",4.6,48.86228149999999,2.3598519,"We had the regular tasing menu and it was amazing! The dishes and the wine pairings were outstanding.  The depth and intensity of the flavors was truly scrumptious.  The fish courses were elegantly and perfectly prepared. The steak course was by far the best steak Ive had in my life. So dang yummy and compared to prices in California where were from it was a bargain! Mange! Dining at Dessance in Paris was an unforgettable experience that tantalized our taste buds and left us with lasting memories. We had made reservations for the tasting menu with wine pairing, and I must say, it was a delightful culinary journey from start to finish.

One of the highlights of our visit was the opportunity to sit outside. The outdoor seating area offered a charming ambiance, allowing us to soak in the vibrant atmosphere of the city while enjoying our meal. The setting felt intimate yet lively, creating the perfect backdrop for a special evening.

The tasting menu was a beautifully curated selection of dishes that showcased the chef's creativity and attention to detail. Each course was presented with artistic flair, and the flavors were nothing short of exquisite. From the first bite to the last, it was clear that each dish was thoughtfully crafted, with a balance of textures and flavors that danced on the palate.

The wine pairing was equally impressive. Each selection complemented the dishes perfectly, enhancing the overall dining experience. The staff was knowledgeable and passionate about the wines, providing interesting insights into each pairing, which added an extra layer of enjoyment to the meal.

Overall, our experience at Dessance was a true celebration of culinary artistry. The combination of delicious food, excellent wine pairings, and the lovely outdoor setting made for a memorable evening in Paris. If you're looking for a fine dining experience that offers a unique twist and a focus on seasonal ingredients, Dessance is definitely worth a visit. It's a dining experience that beautifully captures the essence of Parisian cuisine, and I can't recommend it highly enough! Came back to Dessance after 7 years last time in Paris. The experience was just as great as the last time and lived up to the memory.  I had the land  sea menu, and some of our table had the vegetarian. They were both amazing. Service was excellent and attentive. Food was intricate, balance and fab. Highly recommend. This is the experience of a lifetime. Every dish is more unique and absolutely delicious than the previous one. Im a foodie and Ive been all over the world but Dessance is the place Ill always look forward to. Very good pick in Le Marais district! Refreshing vegetal or flexitarian cuisine with a tasty world twist. Modern decor, comfortable setting, attentive and welcoming service.

It is not very big but nice and clean.

Ordering food was a little bit funny, as we both don't speak French. With an English menu and some hand gestures we were able to get what we want.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Korean dishes were very tasty and a very welcome contrast to local food classics.
The toilettes were the cleanest I have seen so far in whole Paris.

I recommend the bibimbap with beef and the hot sauce that comes with it.

Thanks to the hosts for a very pleasant diner. Great Korean Food! Had the menu with a salad as a starter, the gyozaspancakes and the beefvegancalamari bibimbap  all very tasty and delicious. The place is close to the Eiffel Tower. The waitress was super friendly and helpful with the menu and welcoming. Food with the taste of Korean hands.
It's nice. It's friendly. It's wellrounded.
Give him a hug We really enjoyed the place, the personnel and the food. They seems to have lots of Korean customers which is a good sign. Just remember their food is mostly pretty spicy. And about the interior decor, I would have expected more Korean vibe. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is cozy ! The servers are very nice and it's really close to the Eiffel Tower !

Sambuja - Restaurant Coréen 삼부자 식당,"65 Rue du Faubourg Montmartre, 75009 Paris, France",4.4,48.8764101,2.339565,"Its really great to have an authentic Korean food in Paris , its surprisingly to have good food like in S Korea , nice dishes and appetite, kimchi. Truly an authentic Korean meal no wonder so many Korean celebs have visited this resto!!
I highly recommend trying Bossam as an entre boiled pork slices served with tofu and fresh oyster kimchi and the yuzu roll cake as a dessert.
Some people may find that certain Korean dishes can be quite salty the sauted ones or cause too much heat in the bodyfor example personally due to excess use of black pepper in jjigae, so it's best to do a bit of research to know how to balance your meal choices and avoid stomach upsets later on.
All in all, it's an experience not to be missed and Id love to come back to try their famous sundae soup! Was craving some gamjatang , one of my favorite back when I lived in Korea. So glad we found this place! The food was not adjusted to tailor to the locals tastebuds in anyways and instead very much loyal to the authentic taste and spice level.

Will come back every time I go to Paris. Sambuja has so many options for entree, plats, and drinks and all the dishes I have tasted  black sausage based soup ssundae gukbap, steamed pork belly with tofu and kimchi and soft tofu soup are authentic and flavorful. The service is efficient and they have big tables for different size of groups. I will definitely come back! We are from LA ,CA which is really good Korean foods place but Bossam is the best place here that I have ever eaten. It is really nice and best quality ever. We really enjoyed foods and services.

And it was!  The servers wear white shirts with ties and were kind and accommodating.

The food I had was exceptional.  The French onion soup, or just onion soup, as they call it here  was delicious  not the best I w ever had  but delicious.  It was the Omble chevalier or Artic Char fish that had me licking the plate clean!!!

The interior needs a bit of a loving update, but we sat on the cafe chairs outside and the corner is absolutely charming! What a restaurant ! We just loved it ! Very cosy Parisian vibes with its interior decoration and French cuisine they brought to the table. It was freaking delicious ! We had onion soup and orange duck, both so yummy ! Waiters are super funny and friendly, we will definitely come back again. Thanks ! Authentic French dining experience in the heart of Paris. We went there after exploring Le Marais and it was perfect! The ambiance is simply beautiful, and the service was topnotch and professional. Truely a perfectly authentic Parisian experience. Food was absolutely delicious and the service was amazing. We shared everything. Loved our first time trying escargot, then the classic onion soup, beef bourginion, creme caramel and the prettiest strawberry dessert. Ooh la la! If theres one thing for sure, this is the friendliest service you will find in all of Paris! Our server was full of energy and so kind! She allowed us to try to wines and find the perfect one, ensuring that we would fully enjoy the glasses of wine that we purchased. The onion soup was the best weve had in Paris, the cheese was not too thick and hard as it has been at other places. The signature dish bourguignon was very good, as was the escargot.

As a korean living abroad, I do love the food there so much.
I can proudly tell its real authentic Korean cuision.

Ill surely visit Midam when I visit Paris next time and will recommend the place to my friends living in Paris and planning to visit Paris.

Thank you for the truly wonderful experience. A small restaurant ran by Koreans. I dont feel that the bibimbap is that authentic though, I feel its missing an element that I cant quite identify. Bof, it didnt satisfy my bibimbap craving

The owner's service is also very good. But you have to queue up almost every time, so come early if you re hungry. The portions are HUGE. We ordered Tangsooyuk sweet and sour pork, it said it was for 2 people, and Jengban Jjajang black bean noodles large size which said they were for 2 people as well, but 3 of us struggled to finish the dishes. The dishes were delicious and prices were affordable. The restaurant is relatively small and gets busy very fast, so come early! Food tasted exactly like what I had in Korea, very good. Highly recommend.
Every portion is enough for 23 persons. Make sure you order right amount.  I have heard this restaurant for specialityJjajang, Champpong, Tansuyuksince over 10 years. Side dishes for Dakgalbi was good as well. Finally I have tasted them with friends. Glad to find here. I can recommend to my Korean friends. The service was attentive even though it was busy.

1.  Better to arrive at least 15 mins before.
Today we have arrived 10 mins before opening, we are lucky to take the last table. The first service has finished around 20h 30.
2. Tangsuyuk comes faster than other main dishes, so it's better eat Tangsuyuk while waiting for other dishes. Their sweet and sour pork dish is delicious but the sauce is too sour for me and it reduces the quality of the dish significantly.  I love their black bean noodles or in other words, I love it.  Their food offerings are also numerous!","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 7:00 – 10:00 PM

The owners and staff go above and beyond to ensure a delightful dining experience, making every visit feel like a warm welcome. The food was so delicious!!     We ordered a lot. It was quite pricey but definitely worth it!  We went here for lunch the food was okay but not great. The portions were small and the dishes pricey. We ordered the teokboki with cheese, and their taste was far away from the authentic ones. The soup was okay we enjoyed the Korean veggies pancake, but again it tasted more like inspired to Korean ones. The best Korean You will have is here.

Recommend buying 2 meals combined for ultimate experience tteokbokki  chicken, the best chicken Ive had in my life.

Service is exceptional. If you want an authentic Korean food experience, then I wouldn't recommend it.

The food was average the fried chicken was a bit soggy, the pancake was not crispy, but the kimchi noodle was okay.

The food was not bad, but not good or memorable as well. There are definitely better choices in Paris. 610","Monday: Closed

De la Tour,"6 Rue Desaix, 75015 Paris, France",4.6,48.8544716,2.2949214,"Quaint French restaurant near the Eiffel Tower with white linen table clothes and excellent French food. They have a menu with 2 or 3 courses for lunch and dinner. Seating capacity for 2430 people. Reservations are recommended.  Plates were beautifully presented, and the flavors were excellent in every course. Not a bad bite all night, for everyone at the table. We visited Paris with our kids and wanted to experience a traditional French cuisine experience. This restaurant was perfect for our family. Beautiful quaint restaurant and amazing food, what else could we want! We had the Duck a l'Orange and the salmon. Both dishes were exquisitely done. Escargot was also tasty as well at the desserts we tried. I wish we lived closer so we could visit more frequently. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area. This is it!  A super friendly, family atmosphere.  The signature Foie Gras is home made.  I wished to try every menu here.  I would definitely come here again.

The Feux d'artifice, fillet, was so tender, though well cooked outside.

The only thing, the volume of desert Crme Brle. Very big, but can we blame?  No!  Hahaha.

Im really grateful to my friend who took me here! Hidden gem close to the Eiffel tower.  I had ratatouille and fillet mignon with gratin potatoes.  Everything was well presented and delicious, while the service was friendly and intimate.  The restaurant is charming and feels authentic.  This was a great experience for a tourist couple like us.  I won big boyfriend points. Family owned. Best pate Ive had!!! Fabulous food. Attention to every details on your plate. Crme Brle is a must!

Happy Grill 해피그릴,"22 Rue Frémicourt, 75015 Paris, France",4.7,48.8473832,2.2986956,"Absolutely loved it
We took the pork and beef combination grill. It was so good. The service is also really lovely.
I will definitely go again I love everything here, foods were so good like I cannot even find something to complain. Kimchis the best we ordered it like twice and it came as a big portion. Staffs were very nice and helpful. You dont have to grill by yourself because they will do for you.

I would recommend this restaurant! Ordered the beef set for two. Meat is not marinated so will dip in sauce. Like the side dish better and would come back for lunch instead of dinner. Service is quick and friendly. 5 stars for the weekday lunch special! A super nice Korean restaurant to try !
We shared pork raviolis and fried caramelized chicken  both were super good and fresh !
We shared a beef faux filet bbq and every side dish was super good and home made
They explained every single ingredient and shared their experience. Staff is super friendly ! We loved it and will test it again  Absolutely amazing! We came to visit France, specifically Paris and didnt know where to eat until we stumbled across this delicious restaurant. It is really cozy inside as well outside, perfect for the summer. We choose to grill some meat and for my friend whos vegetarian, was also a lot to choose from! The most authentic Korean restaurant weve ever been to in all Europe! You really see and taste, that they know what theyre doing. Im actually speechless because it was so tasty. We will definitely come back to France, especially for this restaurant, can only recommend. The staff was super nice as well and really helpful, they spoke great English and explained everything in detail to us. Thank you for being so kind to us, we will see you again!","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 7:00 – 10:00 PM

Song Heng,"3 Rue Volta, 75003 Paris, France",4.5,48.8647245,2.3567826,"The broth here is on the sweeter side, the beef in pho is not the thin sliced one just stating a fact not complaining. The menu is simple and perfect for those who dont like to choose. Worth the line, this is what one needs for the cold rainy windy days in Paris. I went to Paris for 4 days and I ate here 2 times! The Pho was huge and the broth is flavorful and sweet from those bones and so good! My favorite would be Bun Bo tho because every bite I had was full of flavor and freshness from the fresh vegetables, i normally dont eat fresh mint leaves but this dish has a place in my heart. My boyfriend who never had Vietnamese food said its the most healthiest breakfast I ever had  its just so good and the beef in both Pho and Bun Bo are just chefs kiss, so soft and tender and flavorful and just sooo good. The spring rolls are freshly made and fried and cost 1 per piece, like are you kidding me?? I went to some random street food stall and paid 6 euro for 3 spring rolls that were a frozen and not delicious at all, this place is a gem, I recommend to arrive at the restaurant around 11.1011.20 a.m. and you will get in the restaurant so quick or maybe the first round of customers 
P.S. The place is small you have to share the table with other people and the bathroom is also clean. Authentic Vietnamese pho in Paris! Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. Be prepared to queue as its quite a small restaurant but well worth the wait. Hidden gem in Paris serving up some topnotch pho. The broth has a perfect balance between savory and a touch of sweetness, though it might have MSG, as I felt quite thirsty afterward.

Its a super tiny place, fitting just 22 seats, so expect to get up close and personal with your dining neighbors. Despite the cramped space, the line moves quickly since people dont tend to linger too long.

The service was fantasticfriendly and fast, with the soup arriving piping hot.

If youre not up for the cozy dinein experience, Id say takeaway is the way to go. Pho is with thai basil no cilantro was visible, but I guess its in it too. Meat in the pho were very tender, soup was flavorful.

Bo bun was very refreshing and stuffy. Both were very authentic food. So food in general, i recommend.

Big disadvantage was space. Too small, you gotta sit with other group of people, and waiting is around 30mins.

But even though, I will visit here again.","Monday: 11:15 AM – 4:00 PM

La Jacobine,"59-61 Rue Saint-André des Arts, 75006 Paris, France",4.6,48.8533819,2.3389252,"They gave away my reservation and we had to wait over an hour for our replacement table BUT...

It was worth it.

The staff were very apologetic for the inconvenience and compensated a drink off of our bill.

Our server was very friendly and fun. He was fluent in French, Italian, and English. Very impressive!

The food was excellent.

We're from the US and typically when I order escargot the snails are out of the shell and soaking in garlic butter.

Here the snails are in the shell, so it's a bit of effort to get the snail out of the shell if you're not used to it, and the taste is more natural since they're not soaking in the garlic butter.

And the Onion Soup aka French Onion Soup is spectacular.

I order French Onion Soup from any restaurant that offers it, and this was Top 3 maybe Top 2 I've ever had. Note, it's way less salty than the French Onion Soups I've had in the US.

Overall, I'd probably make an effort to go to La Jacobine any time I go to Paris. Absolutely delicious! The best meal we had in Paris. We almost went back for a second meal. The staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. The food was extremely flavorful and left us wanting to lick the platesbowls. We had French onion soup, Duck Tajine, Raviolis, Escargot, Cheesecake and PistachioAlmondRaspberry tart. The Duck was out of this world good. The raviolis were rich and extremely tasty. It makes my mouth water thinking of this meal, every dish was absolutely delicious. If you dont have a reservation, be prepared to wait for a no show or them to accommodate you, as it can be an hour plus. They gave my mom and I wine while we waited. Overall 1010 recommended and cant wait to go back next time Im in Paris! One of our favorite places to eat while in Paris. The best onion soup weve had. Incredibly friendly staff with a great atmosphere. Reservations are highly recommended, otherwise plan to arrive 1520 minutes prior to opening and theres potential you will be able to get a table without a wait. This was my go to since I missed it last time in Paris. It really is a cute place with line ups before opening. The sever was really kind and helped me figure out how to eat the escargot properly.  The duck confit, amazing . The most vegetables I've got on a plate in Paris. The French onion soup was also very good. This place was a blast!! We went there without any reservation walk in customers and waited about 2 hours for the table, and Im telling you its totally worth the wait! We ordered french onion soup, duck fillet with mushroom sauce and duck leg confit. All the dishes were utterly delicious and mindblowing like a real piece of culinary art!!! Another great French style dining experience. I highly recommend this place! ","Monday: Closed

구이 레스토랑 GOUI PARIS,"12 Rue Dalayrac, 75002 Paris, France",4.2,48.8675211,2.3351868,"This restaurant has a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere indoors yet also offers an outdoor space for dining. The food was good but not the best. For instance, the japchae served to me was microwaved and some parts were overheated so it turned out too hard or chewy. On the other hand, I found their spicy pork packed with flavors. Their plating presentation also deserves a compliment. I recently had lunch here and really enjoyed my meal!
I chose the crpe de kimchi and bibimbap from the lunch set menu, which was accompanied with soup and three sides with the bibimbap.
I asked for a vegetarian bibimbap with tofu, and the restaurant kindly accomodated my request.
The food here is very delicious  I highly recommend this place! I recommend getting their spicy calamari, barbecue salmon and bone free chicken wings ! The tofu salad wasnt my favourite but the waiters were super friendly ! Hidden gem that deserves giving it a try . It was the first day that restaurants  reopened to the public, so you can imagine how excited I was to be able to eat out again. A lot of restaurants that we wanted to visit continued to serve meals only as takeouts due to lack of terrace space. Goui Paris was one of those that had the possibility to serve meals outside as they are located in passage Choiseul.
Unfortunately the dine in experience wasnt as great as I would have hoped, the bibimbap I ordered was just lukewarm, the stone bowl wasnt hot enough to cook the raw egg inside, no chili sauce was offered I had to ask for it. I had to ask several times for the tap water and there werent even that many people The side dishes also came much later. Taste and flavor are ok, I have tasted better Korean dishes in Paris. Price wise on the high end, I would not recommend if you have other choices one of the workers was unnecessarily rude towards us from the minute we stepped in the restaurant. she was ignoring us all the time when we tried to order, then when we tried to ask for water because she didnt bring any even though the food was already served and also when it was paying time. note that it was not busy, she was on her phone all the time.
food was okay but did NOT enjoy at all her behavior and being around there. felt uncomfortable the whole dinner.","Monday: 12:00 – 3:00 PM, 6:00 – 10:30 PM

we got the japchae, spicy pork, and kimchi stew. everything was awesome. very clean, nice environments, and servers were amazing. definitely coming back for next trip This is the best Korean restaurant in Paris even in Europe ,without doubts.  I was looking for decent Korean restaurants, not fusion but real Korean food. And here is the right decision.!!!! Best Korean food in Paris! The flavors are great and I always feel welcome. The place is very friendly and well kept. Its like a home cooked meal with a homey atmosphere. Definitely recommend it! Everything about this place was fantastic!

I think I ate there 34 times while traveling because I have kids! All the food was delicious, especially the chicken, although the number of pieces looked small, each piece was as big as a fist and was delicious. The owner was kind and the side dishes were so perfect that I didn't even think of Korea while traveling! Nice service and atmosphere is calm, but bbq was too watery and food was not complex enough. No spice either, and kimchi was disappointing unfortunately. We wont be returning anytime as not worth the price We visited for the first time today, and ordered the Korean bbq for 2.  The proprietor was helpful in explaining it to us since we'd never had it before.  The portion size was decent, and the food was delicious!!  We will definitely be back! We were on our way to Palais Garnier when it came to lunch time, after checking many restaurants we found this Korean restaurant and we decided to give a try! This spot is so cozy the main floor was full and We were seated on the second floor, the staff was so kind even we dont speak French they were so patient taking our order, the food was so delicious  we loved the chicken and raw beef honestly to be in a touristy area the food is so good and the price is so reasonable. I recommend it!!!!! Pretty authentic Korean restaurant with comfort  homey vibes. We ordered many dishes soondobu, bulgogi, rabokki, mul nangmyeon, but most of them are too sweet, but overall it was good and the portion was big.","Monday: 12:00 – 3:00 PM, 6:00 – 11:00 PM

Unfortunately the goat cheese one I ordered was a bit of a miss of textures and balance when it came to the ingredients.

However my friends plates seemed to be more balanced and flavorful when it came profile. Lovely galetterie with excellent service. We arrived at midday when it opened and could get a table straight away. My galette complete with onions and tomatoes was easy to ask without ham and it was amazingly well balanced and filled to the brim with cheese, which paired well with the tomatoes and onions. My husband's goats cheese galette was good but not amazing. Our sweet crepes were delicious, i suggest the apple and caramel as that was better than my husband's chocolate. It was a little pricey at 52 euros, but not awful pricing for the quality and area. We were nearby and the kids wanted crepes. We found this place and it definitely didn't dissapoint. We hadn't had galette before but the family enjoyed their dishes and kids loved their crepes. The cafe was super busy but the 2 waiters accomodated our big group and didn't miss a beat in a busy Sunday lunch service. Lovely! We have been to this cafe almost 8 years ago. We loved it then and still love it. As a family we traveled to Brittany 3 years ago and tried many crepes et cidre. This time we tried the one with goat cheese, crme of truffle and chicken with sauce of mushrooms. Also ordered a pitcher of cidre. The cidre had great flavor of the countryside perhaps a farm in Normandy and had the sweet smell of apples but with a dry pucker in the mouth. The service is amazing and it is super fast if you get there before the crowd! These crepes were amazing and we loved all of the options. They had many gluten free crepes and also had both sweet and savory. They are a small family owned business and they operate so quickly! It was great to sit down and enjoy a lunch by their open air seating options in the heat of June. Highly recommend the salmon and leek crepe.","Monday: 12:00 – 3:30 PM

The food arrived at lightning speed, which made me wonder if it was prepared in advance. However, that didn't take away from the experience. The chicken was moist and juicy, bursting with flavor, while the steak was cooked to perfection.

The salad was fresh and vibrant, and the escargotwhat a treat! They were delightful little morsels that really showcased the essence of French cuisine, especially considering the price.

The service was decent, but the only downside was the state of the toilets. Unfortunately, they were quite dirty, and theres only one for the entire establishment. It seems that in France, they sometimes forget that the bathroom is also part of the dining experience!

Overall, if you're looking for a place where you can enjoy delicious food without breaking the bank, this spot is worth a visit. Just be prepared to hold it until the end of your meal! We were looking for a place to have dinner and found this little gem. It was really crowded but they were able to squeeze us In however I would recommend booking a place in advance. The onion soup was really great and the Chicken was also exceptional. Service was great and the food is also not super heavy on the pocket. Will highly recommend trying the place out. Our all time favourite restaurant in Paris! Great food, reasonable price and good service. Indulge in flavours of French cuisine  duck confit, escargot and many more! Excellent gem, about a 20 min stroll from the louvre, but well worth it. Very busy but service was quick.  Food delicious and good prices 64 euros 3 beers, 2 mains, 1 side, 2 desserts.  Definitely worth a visit! Came during the Olympics after visiting some museums. Good to great food, in a truly French atmosphere. The eggs mayonnaise were incrediblebest mayo I've ever had. I had a salad and my husband had the entrecte. They were satisfactory without being extraordinary. The green beans, though, were super simple and excellent. We split the profiteroles for dessert Chou pastry, nougat ice cream, semi sweet chocolate sauce, and almond slivers. As memorable as the mayonnaise. Prices were normal for Paris. Service was good, as long as you remember that in France, waiters do not check on you every five minutes and everything takes time.","Monday: 12:00 – 11:00 PM

Ober Mamma,"107 Bd Richard-Lenoir, 75011 Paris, France",4.6,48.8644739,2.3701387,"Come here for the famous truffle pasta and pizza. In the beginning I was not to excited for the queue weve already reserved online, and we still needed to wait for an hour before getting seated. It was also not clear on how to wait, no clear sign and we still need to ask the waiter to make sure we got noticed.
But the food was fantastic! And the service once we seated was also fine. My family and I came here for the iconic truffle dishes, and they surely did not disappoint!! We got sat in the main dining area, under the beautiful tree. Our server was wonderful and gave us great recommendations on winedrinks. We were crazy about the truffle so ordered 2 pasta dishes and 1 pizza. I could eat the pasta forever, it was amazing! Would recommend any of the Big Mamma restaurants! Enjoying Pink Mama, we thought wed enjoy this spot. And we did, but most dishes needed a bit more salt. The space is stunning and we got a table right away for lunch around noon on a Tuesday. To drink, we enjoyed the Bellini Spritz, which is 10 Euros and a healthy pour. To eat, we shared the burrata, the zucchini, the melon, and the prosciutto. Everything was good, but again, needed salt to bring out the flavors. Ober Mama in Paris offers an exceptional Italian dining experience. The ambience is warm and inviting, with every detail carefully curated. The food is topnotch, full of authentic flavors and crafted with precision. A mustvisit for lovers of fine Italian cuisine! I was craving Italian after coming back from Milan.  Parma e Meloni and Aperol Spritz usually, so I googled and found Ober Mamma close to me that is highly rated.
It did not disappoint !  Our server, who happens to be from Milan guided us to an incredible meal.  Everything was delicious!  Our server was very attentive.  Gave us enough time to talk and catch up while making sure we have everything we need.
This looks like a famous spot for birthdays and gathering.  While it was packed, it wasnt as loud as I would expect.   We still had a peaceful and very delicious meal.  The hosts made very thoughtful decisions in placing guests making sure we are all comfortable even with a packed restaurant.  We were in the interior of the restaurant under the beautiful glass ceiling and artfully decorated with tree branches.
We will definitely be back!","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 6:45 – 10:45 PM

The restaurant staff were courteous and helpful. Very well connected by Metro line M4, this restaurant is highly recommended for anyone looking forward to an enjoyable Korean cuisine experience. Authentic Korean food but should make a reservation before coming. Gets busy quickly. I've had better Soft tofu stew soondobu jiggae but overall nice ambiance and price. Came again and got japchae which I highly recommend. Bathrooms clean. Fantastic food and felt very close to what we experienced when visiting South Korea. We had two bibimbaps, a kimchi jeon and shared a bottle of makgeolli. The banchan side dishes are included with your meal. Service was fast and efficient. Definitely worth a visit to make a change from the typical French bistros. Id love to come back here someday. All dishes were really tasty, tteokbokki was specially great and spicy in a good way! The best one we have ever tasted, along with the fried chicken. The amount of food is really generous, and they even give you kimchi and some salad. The woman and staff are really nice, attentive and quick. 10 out of 10  The food is decent. The restaurant is small, and it can get packed pretty quick. The have indoor AC. The place is nice and clean. Price is reasonable. You can get full meal 23 for salad, mando, fried cake, and main dish","Monday: 12:00 – 2:00 PM, 7:00 – 10:00 PM

We went there on Monday evening but we had to wait for 30 minutes to get the table, they have only walking in system, not table booking in prior. The system was quite intriguing. The food was great with an amazing service. Every thing is so quick. The ambiance is amazing. The cost is worth too. Must try restaurant as it has started from 1968. Looks can be deceiving! This restaurant boasts a high Google Maps rating 4.24.3, possibly due to its historical significance, but don't let that fool you. The food quality was a major disappointment. The french fries tasted like they'd been reheated multiple times, and the meat was simply inedible. Sadly, I cannot recommend this place based on my experience. The fastest serving of food I ever had! Incredible! It tasted pretty good, and the prices were very cheap. The service is quick and efficient. One downside other tables are very close yours  so its a bit cozy

Id definitely recommend this place.

Here's a polished version of your new review



The fastest serving of food! Incredible! It tasted pretty good, and the prices were very cheap. The service is quick and efficient. One downside is the seating people are so close that you're practically at the same table. Despite that, this place is worth recommending. I checked Google for restaurant near me, and found this place with over 22k reviews in Google, and have to try it.  I have never seen any place with so many reviews!  Then I found out this is a restaurant with hundreds years of history, with very reasonable price.  We tried three appetizers, two main dishes, two desserts, and coffee, and happy with all the food we tried.  The waiter is very efficient, he wrote the order and calculated the check total on the table cover paper which is very special.  We are lucky to find this special place. we have been here for dinner 2 times and we have not been disappointed even once. The food is at a great price, the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant is very authentic. The place was packed, they seated us at a table where someone was already sitting. The food was good, but the waiter didn't warn me that the duck breast was medium rare, so it was pretty bloody, which I don't prefer.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 12:00 AM

Highly satisfied with the food and service. Will definitely be back! Beef intestines BBQ is tasteless. Good taste of pig feet and chicken feet. Portions are small. Cold noodle is good. In general, not very authentic Korean food. We loved the kimchi pancake and the pork bbq. The hotteok was a bit flat but the taste was good. We ate outside in a pleasant, quietroad setting. On the pricey side of course, but then again... Paris! Many Koreans were eating there too. We will go back gladly!! Delicious food and noticeable quality, friendly staff, efficient service.

We were just a bit too close to the other clients and chairs were not very confortable especially when you need to move every 10min as people go back and forth.

I recommend it for the good food, the quality and friendly staff. Note that the place also offers a great intimate atmosphere, so it is a good spot during covid season. A bit of green could be added to the terrace  Already come back several times.

Le Petit Pontoise,"9 Rue de Pontoise, 75005 Paris, France",4.6,48.84987039999999,2.3521152,"Warm service, scrumptious dishes and huge portions! Visited with my husband and friend for lunch. We had artichoke tarts for starters delicious!! followed with 7hr cooked lamb shoulder, pork cheeks, and veal kidney. Seasoning of all our dishes were perfect and we all scraped the sauces with bread  Highly recommend. Great find! Saw this as a recommendation from several bloggers, did not disappoint! We ordered eggs as an appetizer and I swear they are the best eggs and mayonnaise I have ever tried in my life! As the main we got antrecot and duck, both were amazing, but duck is just pure gastronomic gem. Also the red wine I tried was way better than you expect for the price. Overall, 910 I visited here yesterday evening after not having gone for 15 years. The first time I came here I was 18 years old and freshly moved to Paris. The dishes changed my brain chemistry and as a dumb American made me realize how real food should taste. Very Julia child of me, I know. I am happy to report that the food is just as good 15 years later. I love this please. Delicious and unpretentious and the staff is incredibly kind and helpful. Wonderful experience. Thank you!!! Fantastic French food. We tried the ravioli, and from the daily lunch menu we had the veal filet, the dourade filet, and the pumpkin soup and everything was exceptionally good. Of the lunch menu, perhaps the only thing that was a tiny bit disappointing was the dessert, but thats just nitpicking.

Our server, Pauline, was incredibly nice and attentive. She made great recommendations and answered all of our questions. you know what? Le Petit Pontoise is a true gem in the heart of the city, offering me an exceptional French dining experience. The intimate ambiance sets the perfect stage, but it's the food that truly captivates. Each bite was so delightful that I found myself closing my eyes to savor the exquisite flavorsa first for me.

The knowledgeable staff's passion for French cuisine shines through in their fantastic recommendations. The foie gras was a standout, with amazing feeling in your mouth and sauce that was simply divine. The pork cheek was the perfect main dish, it is so good that i want to pitch the recipe.

so sorry we didnt say thank you to the chef, Le Petit Pontoise is a mustvisit for anyone seeking a memorable culinary journey. Highly recommended!","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 6:30 – 10:30 PM

The fried chicken is delicious, the soup tastes super good. Have tried several different Korean restaurants in Paris, but this one is definitely better than most of them. Highly recommended! The owner guy is so friendly and kind!! Eventho he does not smile all the time, don't afraid to talk to him he will give you everything you need. I found this restaurant from my friend, and comparing to south korean foods it was definitely different both food  restaurant vibe but in a good way!! Food was yummy, he gave us extra dumplings a lot! I will definitely visit again. My nonkorean friends also really enjoyed the food. Excellent Korean food! Visited the restaurant in May and now I still miss the cold noodles here. North Korean restaurant in Paris to try!

As a South Korean, It was definitely an experience.

The owner seemed a bit cold or unfriendly but who cares if the food is nice.

Ive tried cold noodle   la nordcorenne for the first time and it was a must even if it could be quite odd if you are not used to cold noodles and fried soft shell crab with salt and pepper was also a nice choice, even though it could not be a usual Korean food you see at Korean restaurant.

I will go again next time I am in Paris!! Excellent North Korean food restaurant. I tried Pyeongyang naengmyeon Pyeongyangstyle cold noodle, abai sundae North Koreanstyle Sausage, Yukgaejang Spicy duck soup and corn pancake. Every single food was great, even the side dishes were good. The owner looks blunt, though actually he is kind and nice, He was very kind to us.

It has a bit of a local atmosphere, but there are various shops and restaurants, so it's not a bad way to kill time. There are many restaurants in and around the market.

The food was perfect. The chickens were tender and the chilisweet sauce made this extremely delicious.
The beef and rice were well cooked and the sides made it extra tasty.
It is highly recommended to give this place a try Very authentic meals and I have never had cream tteokbokki before. It was so creamy and delicious really loved it The first Korean restaurant that I ate in Paris, not gonna lie, it is delicious. Should come here earlier than open hour or you will have to queue up for a while.

I tried a matcha bingsu and my kids tried a strawberry bingsu and a mango bingsu. All of them were very tasty and looked amazing. Unfortunately,  they don't accept the restaurant ticket swile card. Hope they will accept it sometime soon ! I tried their matcha bingsu, it was my first time eating bingsu and I liked it. But the taste of red bean filling in the matcha bingsu was too dominant for me, almost as if it was a red bean bingsu. Other than that, the matcha ice cream was perfect. I wish the matcha bingsu was pure matcha, Ill try mango or oreo one in the summer  Real Korean bingsu!!
Super nice except long queue on the weekend. I tried watermelon bingsoo, and vanilla ice latte. I will definitely comeback to get another flavor of bingsoo, so good! Coffee was good at start, but overtime couldnt drink anymore. I also wanted to try fish cookie with beans filling, but it is available only in weekends. Overall, really cute yet small cafe around 20 places to sit. Delicious matcha bingsu. The owner is nice enough but seemed a bit weird when i asked for a glass of water for my daughter.

If you are looking for a different experience and taste try this restaurant which serves halal meat.
We tried honey garlic chicken not enough sauce however the quantity was good.
We tried korean fried chicken as well it was nice it was beautiful! Thr servings of the food was great. Staff is friendly and helps.
Food is of great value  we were three people and spend around 45 euros! I will definitely come back! We ordered the 8 piece honey fried chicken and I'm not sure how to describe it.. it didn't even taste like fried chicken.. But their mixed vegetable rice and chicken rice were quite ok. But the fried chicken served with it really disappointed me. Hope you will adjust the formula. I had a chicken bibimbap and it was very nice. The price is a little bit expensive. The staff members are all smiley and kind however, our waitress was quite abrupt in her serving style but she did make an effort to be kind and smiling. Should it have been slightly less expensive, I would say that it is as good as Janchi but for now Janchi remains the best. The large portion fried chicken8 pieces didnt eat before taking pic cost 14. It is too less chicken and the sauce is too liquid. Taste not bad but definitely not worth the price. If you come here order the bibimbap instead, 16 and you will feel much more satisfying.

Snails and frog legs were something out of this world! Duck and beef for main courses were also amazing!
Service and attention were remarkable.
Overall, a pretty complete and remarkable experience as expected.
I would definitely come back of course! I came here as a walkin client, and the waiter asked if I wanted to have the table inside or outside. I chose outside as it was nice to see people passing by on the street.

My only concern was that the table where I ate moved every time someone passed. This annoyed me.

The servers were polite and accommodating, especially the guy who served me.

I had the Menu of the day for 19 snails for the starter and Lamb's shoulder with candied eggplant for the Main. I also Ordered a plate of frog legs to try for the first time.

I was not too fond of the snails, perhaps because I had tried a different style of cooked snails. The Frog's legs were tasty, but I found nothing special about them. However, the Lamb shoulder and eggplant were quite delicious. The meat was really soft, and the eggplant was yummy. I rarely eat eggplant, but this one I could eat every day.

I would come back to try more of their dishes. I was so happy to find a decent looking restaurant in Paris, which doesn't look, feel or smell like a pub. This felt like a classy place and it was a very nice unique touch that we could try frog's legs alongside the snails. Dishes were cooked to perfection and I've found the waiters very kind which is unusual for Paris Great place with an air of fancy! This place was beautifully located, the facility is very well maintain, classic look, very clean, and comfortably me to sit in. The staff were very nice, service was extremely good, fast, friendly, and we did not have a problem to order in English. The atmosphere was great and they have this funny habit of moving the tables closer to the customer once you are seated.
FOOD the food was great, we had stale and it was perfectly cooked to medium term, very juicy, and absolutely delicious, no overly salty, not heavy on sauce and the meat was reachable to the bone by utensils. We also had the famous snails and frog legs. On the snails, oil was a bit too heavy, herbs were natural and rich but I felt there wasnt too much flavor there. For the fog legs they were fantastic! I was so afraid of the taste, saltiness, sauce, and others, but I must say, it was so easy on the palate, nothing to exaggerate on flavor, and really delicious even for a first timer!  Additionally, we had the beef tartar which was very good and rich in natural flavors. I still think the place it a tiny bit overpriced. We went out for lunch here. We tried their escargot, beef stew and the salmon. They were all delicious. We decided to come back for dinner and tried the other flavors of their escargot, plus their beef tartare and grilled steak! Quite fast to get a table even we dont have a reservation. Well definitely come back.","Monday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM

It was so good, and the service was very nice to us! Love the food and cleanliness of the barbecue pits. Flavours were on point and quite authentic. The kimchi pancake was thick and packed full of deliciousness, would love it to be more crispy. The meats were fresh and delicious.

Service wise, the restaurant gets quite busy and it feels a little understaffed. One thing I didnt like was that the seats were quite close to each other so its quite a squeeze.

Definitely a great korean restaurant place in Paris to try. Second time in 10 days. Have already planned my third. My favourite Korean BBQ in Paris. Really great food. Cosy but slick decor. Diverse clientele, comfortable background hubbub of multilingual conversation, warm atmosphere. Eating amidst people obviously enjoying themselves makes everything taste better.

Efficient, friendly, helpful staff. I leave super satisfied and feeling lucky to have somewhere to go when I want a guaranteed lovely evening. Particularly when combined with a post dinner drink with the wonderful folk running The Honey Moon bar across the road. Currently my favourite 12. they seem to be famous for their bbq but we tried the cold noodles again and I love it!! I usually don't like cold food but this cold noodle has changed my taste. In addition, it goes well with spicy stirfried chicken feet I was a bit disappointed in this dish because the chicken feet were too soft and nothing but spicy. Boudin are not too special. The space is very nice and clean, the staff is enthusiastic. I'll probably come back to try the baked goods. The Bulgogi was delicious and so were the side dishes!

L'As du Fallafel,"34 Rue des Rosiers, 75004 Paris, France",4.4,48.85740670000001,2.3591962,"Highly recommend this place if you are looking for fresh flavorful falafel! Its a small cute place which was extremely crowded. The decor was decent and service was quick. Their mint lemonade and fresh juices were amazing. The portion are large and can be shared. Food was delicious and the falafel wrap was a balanced meal with lots of vegetables in it. This restaurant should have good taste because there was always a queue in front of the restaurant , even though it was neither lunch nor dinner time.
Personally this was the first time that I ate farallel. I simply did not like it.
The atmosphere is like the one of a first food restaurant. The staff were nice. All the food looked very healthy.
I did not eat all the dishes up so I took them away. The portions of plats are quite big for me.
All the guests around me seemed to eat pita pains or  sandwiches. Good falafel in the center of Paris!  The sandwiches are plentiful, we ate them without a side dish and were very satisfied.  As there was a queue, we took it to take away, the queue for this option moved very quickly! I loved this place so much that I had to go back for more. The falafel was on point and I didnt want to miss out in trying the chicken option. Im glad I went back for more. There are more options that I want to try like their stuffed eggplant. Im getting hungry again.

You can either get your sandwich to go or eat inside. There arent that many places around there to sit down if you take it to go. I suggest you wait a bit and try to get a table inside. You can try a plate which is almost impossible to eat on the go.

Def a place you need to try while in Paris. A modest falafel eatery situated in the heart of the Jewish quarter. The service was prompt and amicable, with no wait for a table on our rainy Monday visit.

We tried the cauliflower 13 for a few pieces!, a falafel plate 19, and a chicken liver pita sandwich 16. Comparing prices to our recent experience at Miznon, this spot leans toward the pricier side.

The food, while flavorful, didn't quite reach an exceptional level. The smalltype falafels were more crunchy than crispy. The industrial pitas lacked fluffiness and were somewhat tasteless and dry.

Considering these factors, a return visit seems unlikely.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Au Bougnat,"26 Rue Chanoinesse, 75004 Paris, France",4.4,48.85429670000001,2.350145700000001,"Au Bougnat is in a relatively quiet corner of le de la Cit. We came here after reading the review from Rick Steves and was pleased that we did.
After a tiring day of sightseeing, Au Bougnat was a convenient place for a hearty dinner.
The mains were all great, their Foie Gras, not so. Perhaps we got an odd batch? Either way, their standard menu is excellent. Excellent stop for lunch on a rainy day! I had the duck leg confit, my wife had the salmon. Everything tasted amazing! Service was friendly and timely. Great atmosphere with mostly locals at lunch. The host was super friendly and sweet, delicious 1010 meal. We got the pea velout soup with feta and a few specials. One of the best meals Ive had in Paris! The fish special was incredible. Was recommended this place by several tour guides and it did not disappoint! We ordered the snail casserole, cold gazpacho soup, beef and carrots, and steak and fries. While I was not a fan of the gazpacho as there was an ingredient I did not know, my family devoured it, along with all the other food we were served. Highly recommend this place to anyone in the area. Great find. Romantic style with authentic French food. Great choice, great value too in 'plage du jour' however we did our own and went for the escargot,  veal casserole, seabass which was succulent and divine. Had the vine de Chen.. fermented wine aperitif that worked well with the rich snail sauce. Friendly French relaxed service too.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 11:30 PM

Pain Vin Fromages,"3 Rue Geoffroy l'Angevin, 75004 Paris, France",4.4,48.8605157,2.3545076,"I really loved this place! Its not too big though they also have seating downstairs that i didnt check out, so it isnt too small either, so it feels very cozy, especially for something like eating a fondue and drinking wine on a cold daynight.
We ordered the Mridionale fondue and it was amazing!!  as someone who isnt the biggest fan pf strong smelly cheese, this was the perfect middle ground! The herbs and tomato take just a little bit away from the sharpness of the cheese, which made it perfect for me, and it tasted perfect!
I love that both bread and potatoes were served with the fondue while some other places only include bread and potatoes are extra. It is reasonably priced and in the heart of Paris which is wonderful! Totally recommend this place! I would strongly advise to book before going tho as it gets crowded pretty fast! Great authentic French  Swiss restaurant. We started with the three cheese toast  salad and the goat cheese with honey toast  salad. Both were delicious. He raved about the house red wine and I loved the peach Kir. We shared the Normandy fondue. It was amazing. It's served with the classic boiled potatoes and bread. They really live up to their name ""Bread, Wine, Cheese"". The staff was very friendly and helpful which we especially appreciated given our limited French. Would definitely go back, would love to try the raclette and dessert. Great experience with food, service, atmosphere. A journey in the several regions of France with their best cheese samples . An experience of tasting the combination of cheese, honey , wine and different types of bread. Super recommended I visited this amazing restaurant in 2017. I wanted to make sure that I could get in so I made a reservation online. My flights changed and I let the restaurant know and they were more than flexible to work with me for the reservation.

The point is, the staff at this restaurant are absolutely wonderful. Thank you!

Now to the food. After some deliberation, we decided to go with the fondue. We ordered the Mridionale, emmental, Beaufort, comt, kirsch, white wine, nutmeg, garlic, salt, pepper with tomato and herbs. It came with bread and potatoes. We also ordered the plate of mix ham. Each bite was better than the next. We shared an order of green salad, and the Vikings Salad. We also tried the House red and white wine.

We couldnt possibly think of ordering dessert, but we did. We shared the Negresco, which has coconut and vanilla ice cream with melted chocolate and whipped cream and the L'impriale, which of tangerine sorbet with melted chocolate and tangerine liquor

I cant think of a better meal to have upon arrival in Paris.

Thank you chef! Absolutely amazing. The food and the staff are great. The red wine was delicious. Very important for us is that the staff is kind which is the case here. Absolutely. We went with our 5 years old kid and we enjoyed a great family lunch together. We will come back here the next time we are in Paris. I told the owner that I had one of the best meals there and I was sincere about it.","Monday: Closed

Service and food were outstanding. I had the lunch menu paired with wine and it was amazing. The dishes I enjoyed the most were the asparagus and the famous artichoke truffle soup. But honestly the entire experience was amazing.

The service was perfect. Flawless during the entire experience.

If you have the opportunity to go , I strongly recommend to. A top experience for food lovers while in Paris! Located in a beautiful historic building overlooking the Seine River the restaurant is highly rated for a reason! Perfection at all levels from the service, atmosphere and of course the food! Loved that the chef was saying hello to everyone and that the waiters were showing their personalities! Throughly enjoyed it! Still amazed that they were demoted to 2 stars by Michelin guide in the last couple of years when everything they do only seems to get better. I visited twice in 2021 and 2022 and both times amazing experiences. The restaurant enjoys a unique and monumental setting in Paris 6th district inside Htel de la Monnaie where all decor speaks elegance and luxury. The service is very attentive. Sommelier gives great advice. The food is outstanding with a great balance between classic and creative. Portions are generous and flavours are distinctively rich. Presentations perhaps are too old school and not as elaborated as could be expected. The absolute most epic culinary experience Ive ever been a part of! Guy Savoy, his staff, the ambiance, and of course the amazing dishes all came together to make something so memorable! If you want to experience a great restaurant without shedding a large amount, make the noon reservation and get their lunch menu with 7 courses. It has a big value for money. I have some extra items from the truffle menu.

The food is very good, I also feel its very subjective and they have several menus.

What was amazing was the service, they were always smiling and helpful. They gave me extra servings of the soup and truffle brioche that was incredible.","Monday: Closed

Le Tout-Paris,"8 Quai du Louvre, 75001 Paris, France",4.5,48.8587493,2.3422529,"Best food experience in Paris. Their tasting menu, at 95 Euro, super worth it. I was stuffed and satisfied at the end of the meal. Every dish was special, tasty, and looks so good. Service is attentive, and they even let me take away the baguette that I couldn't finish. One of our best dinners while in Europe.

The view was pretty decent too.

Overall, a great experience. There was a hiccup with a garnish that my wife has an allergy with, that the server didnt take ownership for she ordered a plate to share that didnt say had nuts, and didnt mention it when she ordered or when it was brought to the table, but we would clearly see on top of the dish but the rest of the service was flawless and great so 45 there.

Food was stellar and the lemon tart desert was one of the best weve ever had. Le ToutParis offers a dining experience that is as much about the views as it is about the food. Situated with stunning panoramic views of the city, its a perfect spot for anyone looking to enjoy a meal while taking in the beauty of Paris. The vistas from the restaurant are breathtaking, providing a pictureperfect backdrop that enhances the overall experience.

As for the food, we were particularly impressed with the mashed potatoes. They were incredibly smooth, almost velvety, and seasoned to perfectiona simple dish elevated to something truly special.

Le ToutParis is a fantastic choice for a memorable meal in Paris, where you can enjoy both exceptional cuisine and some of the best views the city has to offer Food Quality 
Le Tout in Paris exceeded all expectations, becoming our favorite restaurant during our trip. The French onion soup was the best I've ever had, even in the August heatit was absolutely worth it. The lobster was cooked to perfection, the sea bass was delightful, and the ratatouille was bursting with flavor. To top it all off, the chocolate tart souffl was to die for.

Ambiance 
With its beautiful view, Le Tout provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable dining experience. The atmosphere was quintessentially Parisian, making every moment feel special.

Service 
The service at Le Tout was impeccable, with attentive staff who enhanced the overall experience. Every detail was thoughtfully taken care of, allowing us to fully enjoy our meal.

Overall Experience 
Our entire experience at Le Tout was a perfect 1010. From the phenomenal food to the stunning views and outstanding service, it was a dining experience that will be cherished and remembered.

Recommendation If you find yourself in Paris, a visit to Le Tout is a must. Whether you're savoring their divine French onion soup or indulging in the chocolate tart souffl, you're in for a culinary treat that will stay with you long after the meal is over. Out of this world experience from start to finish. The team is warm and welcoming.

Restaurant Taki,"54 Rue du Dr Finlay, 75015 Paris, France",4.4,48.8509369,2.2917695,"Its a really really amazing restaurant. With fresh Sashimi, the Nabeyaki Udon is tasty, especially the Katsudon here is delicate but when you open the box you definitely will be astonished because it very huge and also yummy.

Further more , you can also see the cook deal with the Sashimi with cautious attitude, really respect to the cook.

Strongly recommend this restaurant, I think you will enjoy the food here , never regret. 55!
I definitely recommend this place. As a relatively small corner restaurant, my family went there for lunch expecting an okay experience. Instead, we found a gemstone restaurant that we will definitely be eating at again. First of all, the service was perfect. The restaurant was supposed to close at 215, and we came to the door 30 seconds if not a minute late. They still accepted us as customers and were very kind. The chef made wonderful food and they were very accepting and happy to serve us. The food was also magnificent, as earlier mentioned. The gyozas were the best weve ever had, and the quality of the ingredients was perfect. The sushi had perfect ratios of fish to rice, and we loved it so much! The fish was also fresh and delicious. This is a perfect family place, and it is so delicious! 100 recommend it for you and your family! Coming back after 2 years . They changed the menu after covid, which made us stop coming.   Surprisingly, they  put back the old menu, which are really great  and delicious  . Japanese restaurant.  Fresh tuna nd salmon.  Price affordable. Love the tempura. BEST JAPANESE RESTAURANT IN PARIS!

Backstory This place was my favorite restaurant since I first ate here back in 2018. I ate here for almost every week until Covid hit. I got really devastated when I came in 2021 and learned that they changed it to a ramen place. I literally cried and never came back

Very happy to learn that the sushi chef came back last Aug and I had to come and see if everything was as before

Ambiance is like before. Cozy and simple.

Service is very good. The chefs are amazing and very nice and friendly!! The waiter was very nice and was very accommodating and made sure all our requests where met.

Food was great as always. Just like before. Everything was fresh and big cuts. The  plates are very generous. The sashimi tuna, salmon and scallops literally melts in your mouth. The best fatty tuna thon grastoro. The tempura wasnt like as before, they were still good but they were better before.

Prices were higher than before but still cheaper than other places with the same quality of food. The price is very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.

Bonus they take reservations.

I highly highly highly suggest this place. This is the best sushi place in Paris. Amazing quality sushi run by a Japanese family.
The food is so fresh , authentic and tasty and so different from the so many sushi places that resembles fast food. Highly recommend it.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:15 PM, 7:00 – 10:15 PM

This was exactly what we were looking for it is on a quiet street so no people watching but it was perfect for us.
We were amazed by how good the service was and the food was amazing!!!! Really it was so good. We had the hummus, escargot,  and beef appetizer. The escargot the best weve had in Paris!!! We will be back for dinner without a doubt! Fantastic food, the atmosphere is very welcoming and warm. The escargot was phenomenal, a musthave! The dinner was great, my recommendation would be the sea bass as it was light and tasty. One of the best sauces we've ever had with the sea bass! Highly recommend stopping here after a long day of visiting Paris. We were greeted with a warm welcome and a lovely bread basket. The escargot was so delicious in the garlic pesto sauce. The angus steak is a must order. It was beautifully cooked and it had a wonderful sauce. We also recommend the steak tartare. It had amazing flavors when paired with the potatoes, tiny tomatoes and olive! The service was great and our server very friendly. We enjoyed the dinner at La Calche and look forward to coming back. Incredible food, service and overall dining experience. We were even given a special candle on our dessert to celebrate our honeymoon. Highly recommend! Restaurant staff is amazing. Every single thing we ate was top notch from the escargot to the steak to the chocolate with pistachio sauce.  An evening wonderfully spent.

Incredible view. They do city views right. Unfortunately they dont do meat right. Good news thoughthe point of this outing was the viewwhich, again, was spectacular. Wait staff was also super friendly and funny, and it felt like they genuinely wanted our night to be good. And it was. Justif youre a foodie and thats the primary try goal, I would go for drinks rather than get a reservation and the fixed menu. Pro overlooking the city of Paris.
Cons food not that great. The chicken is very rich to the plate, beef is just ok, the crab and fish salad had over ripe tomatoes. Wine is ok. Spent 165 euros. Paid for atmosphere. Could have been better if close to the windows but we have to have the special menu which doesn't look  sound appetizing. The building looks round down. The lower level looks scary and abandoned. On our first trip to France, this stuck out as not only our worst experience, but the only thing on our vacation that we seriously wish we could have had a ""do over"" on. Yes, the view is beautiful, but I would have to imagine that you could get a much better experience just about anywhere else.

The building was old, stuffy, and felt like it was in need of some serious updating. You go out of the beautiful French architecture and go into a building that was built in the early 70s and get the sense that it hadn't been touched since.

Our wait staff didn't speak English and I will admit my bad for not speaking French, but just bailed on us and had a different waitress come to take our order. Our table was not her area, so we never saw her again. Nor did we see our waiter again.

The drinks ordered were warm, even for a signature cocktail. Would have loved to have had an opportunity to order a glass of wine, but they never came back.

I ordered the pork chop, and more than 13 of it was pure fat! As a cook, this was unacceptable to me. You are better off reducing that fat and using the flavor in so many other recipes, rather than the customer throwing it away. It is such a waste of the animal, and so unappealing to the consumer.

We skipped dessert as we just felt like not only was our patronage not appreciated, but we just were an inconvenience for them. It took over 20 minutes of waiting for someone to come by at which time I had to waive my hands to flag down the manager to ask for the check.

I can't give a stronger recommendation to SKIP this place. There are so many other great places in France, that we wished we could have experienced those instead.

The pictures show the meal before and after. What was left on the plate was pure fat! Food is terrible, to the point I couldn't eat. The restaurant is old and the carpets are very dirty. Has a weird smell. The only thing you can actually enjoy is the view. However, windows need to be clean so u can enjoy a clear view. I booked the restaurant for my moms birthday in February. Very sweet that they tried their best to choose a table near the window and prepared a little candle for her.

The dishes serves like a standard French restaurant, the decoration and taste valued the price.

Waiters were very attentive and spoke many languages.

Will definitely come back for a special day!","Monday: 8:30 AM – 12:30 AM

Les Ombres,"27 Quai Jacques Chirac, 75007 Paris, France",4.1,48.86178,2.29869,"Ive read some of the other reviews and I have to say my experience at Les Ombres far exceeded my expectations. It is often the case that a restaurant with such proximity to a major tourist attraction rests on its laurels but the staff could not have been more obliging, the offering more inventive, the food more delicious or the setting more romantic. Sun streamed in through the glass the day we dined and it was nothing less than magical. I have no notes and wish to say nothing except thank you! The only good thing about this restaurant is the view of the Eiffel Tower. You are given a set menu with choices of 5,6, and 8 dishes. Main course dish is either fish or pigeon or both depending on which set menu option you choose. Theres no music in the background. Drink selection is very limited. Incredible place for romantic dinner. The staff    is very polite and pleasant. They helped to create romantic atmosphere. The quality of the  food is excellent. You can take photos from the roof with Eiffel Tower as well Good view. Location was lovely.

Food was mediocre, poor for the price you pay. The steak was dry, overcooked and had little flavor. Fish was very good. Desert was a flavorful nectarine and sorbet.

Drinks menu was also limited and there were only 4 bottled beers on the menu.

There was no flexibility on the menu as one person at the table was not allowed to choose the bigger menu while the rest of the table wanted the smaller menu.

The waiters were kind and attentive.

Overall, the views are great, the food and experience were underwhelming for the price. Loved this place for a magical dinner experience. Loved the view of the Eiffel Tower. Food was extraordinary and different from the norm. The atmosphere and even walking in to the restaurant was beautiful. Only complaint was that it was pretty hot in the room before the sun went down, but it didnt damper our time there. Highly recommended this place.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:00 PM, 7:00 – 10:00 PM

Sola,"12 Rue de l'Hôtel Colbert, 75005 Paris, France",4.7,48.851605,2.348313399999999,"Truly exceptional. The chef's concept was a welcome surprise, different from many Michelin star restaurants. The menu is seasonal of course and the overall experience is worth writing about. The wine pairing was well worth it, varying between wine and sake.  We left thoroughly amused, satiated without being overly full, and only a little bit tipsy. We sat in the mineral lounge, which I preferred. Highly recommend. Dont miss this unique dining experience. The service was especially interactive because you are not told the dishes in advance and get to discuss flavors between courses. Perfect to celebrate a special occasion. Highly recommend winesake pairing as well as sitting in the cave! Excellent dining experiencewith the fusion of French and Japanese cuisine being exceptionally wellexecuted. Every dish was cooked and seasoned to perfection. My personal favourites were the lobster soup and the pork. The lobster soup had a rich, robust flavour, and the hint of spiciness added a wonderful depth to the dish. The pork was incredibly tender and cooked to perfection. Their wine pairing was also good as well.

The staff were very professional, offering detailed explanations of the menu. The interactive element of guessing the ingredients in each dish was also unique and interesting, adding an engaging twist to the meal. Even though sometimes can be challenging. They also took the time to thoroughly explain the restaurants sustainability concept, from reusing broken plates to utilising every part of the ingredients to minimise food waste.

The basement seating area is nice, but the only downside is the lack of mobile signal or WiFi, which we were informed before being seated. While I understand the restaurants aim to encourage guests to focus on the food, it would still be better to have internet access downstairs.

Overall, its a good restaurant and definitely worth a special visit when youre in Paris, especially if youre a fan of Japanese cuisine but are looking to try something new. I would recommend it! An exceptional experience! The restaurant is intimate and the service is personable and very professional. The flavors are complex and interesting, and unique among the many restaurants in Paris. Omakase at its best. Nice people, creative, well executed food, nicely presented. Some dishes are spectacular. Only personal drawback Uninspired barsomething piano music in the background that does not make any sense. But this place deserves a visit. The wine and sake  pairing also worked well.

MA-SHI-TA,"9 Rue Poirier de Narçay, 75014 Paris, France",4.9,48.82411889999999,2.3246527,"I had an amazing experience at Mashita! The food was incredibly authentic, with rich flavors that transported me straight to Korea. The Dak Kangjeong and Jaeyuk Bokkeum were especially delicious. The staff was friendly, attentive, and the ambiance was cozy and welcoming, perfect for both casual dining and a special night out. If youre in Paris and craving Korean food, this place is a mustvisit. Highly recommend! The lunch menu offered a set, but Im a loyal fan of raw beef, so I decisively ordered the beef tartare bibimbap!

 The ingredients were fresh, the beef tender and smooth. Although the rice was slightly undercooked, mixing it with the egg and sauces oily fragrance didnt detract from the overall taste.

There were no complex innovations in the dishes, just simple home cooking done well

Overall, its a great little diner spot! It was beautiful Experience
Amazing Korean food really enjoyed it lovely dessert with coffee
Toilet was so nice too
Best experience! I can say that this is the best Korean restaurant in Paris. Reminded me a lot of Korean cuisine that I had when I lived there! Missed this so much!  Perfect dinner authentic Korean food
Super service
A little bit crowded but excellent price to value

Epicure,"112 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, 75008 Paris, France",4.7,48.8717373,2.3148528,"To even say it was a fantastic dinner would not even begin to explain this place.  It has the best service from the time you sit down to the time they call you a taxi.  From the wine pairings to the caviar, I have never had a better dinner.  The tasting menu is a walkthrough culinary wonderland. I highly recommend and hope to go back when visiting Paris again. One of my favourite restaurants in the world with a great captaincy by Mr. Frchon. The service is exquisite and delivers a personalized experience with spot on recommendations and explanations. The food is outstanding with a great balance of innovation, creativity and tradition. A great respect for the ingredients in their cooking techniques, combinations and presentation. To breakup our run of Michelin dinners, we decided on a lunch that offered the same full dinner menu at Epicure. I figured that it would be a long lunch which turned out to be a four and half hour lunch. Yes, the longest lunch of our lives. And it was worth every single minute!

The restaurant inside Hotel Le Bristol is gorgeous. We were met with a beautiful arrangement of flowers and rugs of pinks and violets. The warm reddish tones continued into the dining room where we were greeted with warmth by the staff.

The food here was exceptional with not a single course veering off in excellence. It ranged from the signature caviar with potato mousseline smoked in haddock with buckwheat crips and sour cream dressing, full of umami to the perfectly cooked langoustine in lemon and thyme, onion mango and broth flavored with coriander and citrus fruits. The candele macaroni with black truffle, artichoke and foie gras filling in parmesan cheese, and black truffle juice reminded of a similar dish at Acquerello in San Francisco in visual appearance and ingredients.

Out of the entire lunch full of numerous courses, there were three highlights. The salmon from Scotland in powder of tandoori spices, fennel and cucumber with mint oil and rice vinegar was stunning. Simply, it was the best cooked salmon Ive ever had in my life so far. If salmon is this good in Scotland, I wonder what other types of seafood exists in Scotland Before this, the best salmon I had was from Alaska. The hen breast poached in a bladder was incredibly moist that it cut like butter and the green asparagus with morels that accompanied it in a wine reduction with crayfish and golden chanterelles with Xeres was incredible. I immediately had a flash back to the piece of chicken served at La Grenouille in NYC some 16 years ago which was the best Ive ever had until this dish. To continue this momentum the trolley of macarons and chocolates were incredibly flavorful. I believe she said that the macarons were made on the premise every day. We love macarons and to hear my wife say that these are the best macarons Ive had so far brought immense joy.

To mark our honeymoon, the staff spread red rose petals and an edible sugar sculpture on our table during dessert time. They were genuine, warm, attentive, and clear professionals at hospitality. They made us feel special and well cared for throughout our 4.5 hour lunch for a very memorable experience.

Merci beaucoup, Epicure! Everything was almost perfect, the food, staff, atmosphere.
Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for fine dining. Some of the foods looked like a piece of art. If you don't mind paying the higher price, definitely try the tasting menu. It's hard to describe just how good this place is. We've done Kei and Le Clarence in Paris which were both phenomenal and this edged out both of them. There were literally no misses as far as the plates go and I enjoyed how tasty and yet creative and sometimes cerebral each course was. There was always a play on color, texture and sometimes temperature executed with perfect finesse. It's french cuisine yes but it wasn't completely bound by that. The salmon for example was crusted with tandoori spice and came with a raita like sauce, quite a pleasant surprise.","Monday: Closed

GrandCœur,"41 Rue du Temple, 75004 Paris, France",4.4,48.85960069999999,2.3538752,"That was the first restaurant we visited while in Paris. The service was exceptional! Props to the lady assisting us for our needs. With regards to food, overall everything was tasty but in my view some details I would like to see took away the 55 rating like the crispy skin on the fish. Description of the dishes was quite complicated but in my view they were quite simplistic. I found quite odd the approach of serving 14 of a chicken breast for a main course. Dessert was just OK. We had diners here with chill out atmosphere, the place is lovely. The food itself I would say good but yet special to my opinion. The ingredients were fresh, tasty but still feel like something missing here. The service is excellent any how it was a Nice and chic restaurant. I rarely write negative reviews, but I hope this helps fellow tourists in Paris make an informed decision. For a restaurant that pride themselves as being in the Michelin Guide listing, Grand Coeur was a huge disappointment.

The service was extremely slow. We endured a 30minute wait just to have our orders taken and an additional 40 minutes for the first set of entres to arrive. Given the table's limited size, the four entres were served in two separate batches, resulting in another 30minute delay in between.

The oysters were not properly shucked out where the muscle is still very much attached to the shell, and we were provided with wrong cutlery, forcing us to wrestle with them using a huge entre spoon. As a chef, I found this oversight inexcusable and funny.

The main courses took almost an hour to arrive, i had a glance at the other 3 tables on my side that were also left waiting with an empty table and angry faces. Our table was never wiped clean inbetween courses, and every new dish dropped on our table had to be on top of a dirty clutter.

The food was disappointingly bland and lacked any discernible flavor. Our high expectations were completely unmet, and we left feeling disheartened. Our dinner, intended to be a memorable conclusion of our trip in Paris, stretched from 8 PM to 1145 PM and was nothing short of a disaster.

Thank you but wont be coming back, nor recommending. The interior is sober, bit dungeon like feel  but there is a nice terrace for when the weather is nice. The dishes were good and portions too. The dessert of sorbet and cream sauce was disappointing felt like melted ice cream soup. The chef is clearly a cook more than a patisserie chef. Terrific food. The veal chop was the best I have ever had, without question. Dessert was terrific as well.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 7:30 – 10:30 PM

Le Chanard,"8 Rue Saint-Paul, 75004 Paris, France",4.7,48.8530556,2.3613889,"Sadly a little disappointed after the upbeat reviews. On the plus side the service by the owner was efficient and his wine recommendation excellent.  And the place itself was charming and a pleasant place to eat. However the food was largely average albeit not overpriced except for the large prawn.
The snails average the croquette of pig trotter really didn't work as it was runny and lacked flavour the duck OK but the breast had shrunk, the veal chop the best dish. The single large prawn didn't work at all for the price. Sadly the rum baba was dry and had zero taste of rum. Creme brulee was better. Wow, this was a highlight of our trip to Paris. Small place, small menu  that means they prepare and serve from scratch beware the large menu that usually means dishes are sourced elsewhere and just reheated. Food was excellent and very flavourful, and they have a great selection of French wines and other beverages to compliment any meal. Cozy, small restaurant run by a couple. The pork shank and fish dish were delicious. Entrees were reasonably priced. Dessert was so so. Service got slow when they got busy. Delicious dinner enjoyed here. If you want seasonal menu items cooked beautifully this is the place for you. We enjoyed lapin and pork rib mainentrees, and seasonal berry desserts. Washed down with refreshing cocktails and a bottle of crisp pouilly fume. Highly recommend eating here to get away from the standard tourist menus! Came here due to the good Google reviews. Unfortunately the quality of the food didnt live up to our expectations. We were a bit late due to the rain but the owner welcomed us very warmly. The table was a bit sticky. My starter was ok, nothing special. The other starter was a soup and the taste was just blend. My main dish was white fish, again ok. The other main dish was duck and the meat was quite dry. The desert was too sweet. Overall very overpriced meal and not worth it.","Monday: 6:30 – 11:30 PM

La Tour d'Argent,"15 Quai de la Tournelle, 75005 Paris, France",4.6,48.8497873,2.3549879,"What an exceptional restaurant, its certainly worth the expense and might have the best lunch view in Paris. From beginning to end, top marks from the staff and culinary team on delivering an unforgettable experience with food and wine to match. I will eagerly await my next meal at La Tour dArgent! I didn't have high hopes for a vegan meal andor experience based on the menu options, but resolved myself to have this experience with close friends, even if I wasn't excited about the menu.

That said, with a simple request for a vegan option, I am forever grateful for the curated meal and experience at La Tour d'Argent!

NOTE Our party reached out ahead of time to request a vegan option for me I highly recommend doing that if you have this dietary request.

As a party of five, we requested one vegan meal in our party and it was one of the best vegan meals I've ever had... and likely the best meal and dining experience of my life.

This experience NOT only didn't disappoint, but as a vegan, I felt like the entire meal was explicitly prepared for me. Every single course was curated for my vegan lifestyle and pallet. I never felt like any of the courses were an afterthought.

There was so much thought, care, and preparation involved to ensure my vegan experience not only met but exceeded my expectations.

It was FANTASTIC!!!

Thank you for proving me wrong and, as a vegan, providing me with an exceptional meal and experience! Absolutely exceptional Michelin starred restaurant. There's a strict dress code of jackets for men.
We had the five course tasting menu for 380 each. This was a surprise menu in that they didn't tell you what you were going to get. It did include their signature duck dish.
Wine is a speciality. They have over 300,000 wines in their cave and a heavy book acting as a wine list.
The service was superb and the food was outstanding. This was my first Michelin star experience and it lived up to expectations. The staff was warm and helpful  answering all my questions. The dining room and view are breathtaking. As for the food, it was spectacular. We did the seasonal tasting menu and every dish was perfectly balanced. I can only describe it as art! It was great experience with excellent service from the team right after I placed booking. They helped me for the pass, waited for us to reach the restaurant due to horrible traffic in Paris during Olympic and when we arrived they had accommodated us with warm and welcoming feeling. Food is great and they derserve to be pride of being oldest restaurant with high standards in Paris. If you can afford, I would like to encourage you to try Finding good food in Paris is not difficult but this is legend and it will worth every penny you spend.","Monday: Closed

Jules Verne,"Avenue Gustave Eiffel 2ème, Tour Eiffel, Av. Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France",4.4,48.8583698,2.2944833,"Its hard to miss the beautiful atmosphere and outstanding 5 star service you receive at this restaurant. Of course the food is presented very well and tastes as you expect. A great experience and worth the price. Once Our recent visit to Le Jules Verne was nothing short of spectacular.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warmth and professionalism by the exceptional staff, including Ines, Tiffany, Ann, and everyone else who contributed to our unforgettable experience.

The ambience of the restaurant is simply enchanting, especially as the sun begins to set. If you're planning a visit, I highly recommend making a reservation around sunset to fully enjoy the breathtaking transition from day to night.

While every seating area offers a unique and beautiful perspective, the window seats are particularly magical, providing unparalleled views that complement the exquisite cuisine.
Speaking of which, the food at Le Jules Verne is truly outstanding.

Every dish is a masterpiece, artfully presented and bursting with flavor. The combination of the food, the views, and the topnotch service made our evening here one for the books.

Thank you, Le Jules Verne, for an extraordinary experience. We can't wait to return! We were unable to book a meal on our anniversary but we were able to get a lunch reservation for the weekend that we were celebrating.   From start to finish our experience was spectacular.  We were wished a happy anniversary at the start of our meal and we even got a beautiful dessert with the same sentiment.  The service was wonderful, charming and well coordinated.  The food was delicious and well presented. We booked this restaurant before it got its second Michelin star.  We experienced second star service from the start and only realized that the restaurant got its second star after we looked it up while we were there after I noted that the service was better than I expected.  Thank you for giving us such a wonderful experience for our special occasion!  Your second Michelin star is well deserved. We recently had the pleasure of dining at the restaurant located at the Eiffel Tower with my family, and I must say it was an absolutely incredible experience. From the moment we entered, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality that made us feel truly welcomed.

The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the 7 course meal that we indulged in. Each dish was a culinary masterpiece, expertly crafted with exquisite flavors and presented beautifully. The attention to detail and the use of fresh, highquality ingredients truly showcased the skill and creativity of the chefs.

But what truly made this dining experience exceptional was the breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower. As we enjoyed our meal, we were mesmerized by the iconic landmark standing tall before us. The twinkling lights and the enchanting ambiance created an atmosphere that was nothing short of magical. It was a sight that left both my kids and myself entranced throughout the entire meal.

Not only was the food beyond exceptional, but the service was also impeccable. The staff at the restaurant were kind, caring, and attentive to every detail. They went above and beyond to ensure that our dining experience was nothing short of perfection. Their genuine warmth and hospitality truly made us feel special and taken care of.

I cannot express my gratitude enough for the wonderful memories that were created that evening. The restaurant at the Eiffel Tower truly exceeded all expectations and made our day truly unforgettable. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a dining experience that combines extraordinary cuisine, stunning views, and exceptional service. The restaurant is certainly worth it's Michelin stars with it's exceptional food and service.

The dishes are flavorful and full of techniques.

The view is breathtaking too.
Although, in addition to booking in advance, you'd still need to be early as window seats are first come first serve.","Monday: 12:00 – 1:30 PM, 7:00 – 9:00 PM

Songsan Restaurant,"20 Rue Marmontel, 75015 Paris, France",4.2,48.83666669999999,2.299318,"Songsan is among the very few traditional Korean restaurants of Paris. The staff is almost entirely Korean, the food is tasty and authentic, and the restaurant is modern. Most tables are busy with persons from the Korean community, which is an excellent sign. We loved it, and we will come back! Service good, food Tasty, portion was quite generous.
Cox's approved  It's like the food I eat in Korea. Moderately spicy and sweet. Like Korea, the food you order comes out quickly and the menu is diverse, but most of them are above average in taste. Bossam and Budaejjigae are impressive, and Koreanstyle Chinese food is also good. The chicken was a little disappointing, but overall it is a Korean restaurant that embodies the taste of Korea well. Delicious food and large portions. The bim bap boeuf was especially good. The service was attentive and food came out quickly. I do recommend reserving ahead, but they were able to fit us in when we called the day of.

The only negative to note is the tables are very close together, so much that your chair is touching the wall or the chair of the person behind you.

However, we had a very tasty and filling meal with the 28 menu, and will be happy to return! Nice and delicious lunch with , salad and gyoza ","Monday: Closed

Food was great, service was wonderful thank you to Tom!, wine recommendation was good and restaurant is small and cozy. Make sure to reserve! It was packed.

Bill came to be around 231 euros for 5 people. We ordered 2 entrees, 5 mains, a bottle of wine, and 1 dessert. The dinner was impeccable. Best meal we had so far in Paris, and one of the best dinners in general. Very well balanced flavors and perfectly cooked. The service was excellent. Tom was our server, and did a fabulous job! Merci Beaucoup! One of our favorite spots, if not the favorite spot, of our trip to Paris. Tiny little place so make sure to book in advance, but both the upstairs and downstairs are lovely.

The escargot was unique. Came with edible shells that were super tasty. The duck was a standout as well.

Great service and solid portions for the price. Cant recommend enough. Beautiful little restaurant in a cute neighbourhood with excellent classic French food and great service. The ambience is perfect for a relaxing meal. We had the escargot starter based on a recommendation, and it was so good and addictive we had to order a second portion. Duck fois gras was also very tasty. For the mains we had duck breast and rabbit  both were deliciously favoured and perfectly cooked. The wine list offers excellent choices to pair with the various dishes and at a reasonable price for us coming from London. Deserts and ice cream rounded the night off perfectly. Big thank you to Tom  Marine who looked after us so well, we left very happy. We will be back next time in Paris 100. The food was superb with a very caring and excellent staff. The smoked Stracciatella starter was definitely a highlight in both flavour and texture.

French restaurant with a Japanese chef that assumes his origin.
We have a lot of Japanese chefs in Paris. This one is actually the second restaurant from a Japanese chef Neige d t, review to come but a big backlog
The nice thing is that the Japanese origin are fully assumed but yet its not a Japanese restaurant, its a French one at the end of the day. So its not just the quality of execution and its precision that you enjoy, but you also have a little bit of exoticism without taking any gustatory risk.
The crowd was casual lunch casual for a one star . I went there with a friend to catch up. I did  feel I was not the only one.
It does deserve its star. Wow. One star Michelin restaurant absolutely impeccable, everything was perfect from food to service. Lovely experience high recommended, but not for everyday meal, it's perfect for special occasions and romantic dine. Gorgeous wine list, but not cheap. The general experience here is very good. You are well received and well served. The plates are beautifully dressed and very tasty. The cook is perfect.

The salad with chicken liver was pretty good, the soup was interesting but it was served cold, I think warm would have boosted the flavour. The mashed potato and potato gratin were very good, the fish was flavourless, so not good. And we got the roasted chicken, which was juicy and fine again lacking flavour a bit. however, there were still some chicken feather's in there. I pointed this out to our server and I think they got offended. I mean I know it's not hair, but still it's not very pleasant to have chicken feather's in your food. Fulfilling lunch stomach, mood and spirit! We ordered Tuna as starter with sweet and spicy grilled avocado. The sauce is refreshing and well balanced, not too sweet. Main dishes were Fish of the day, Chicken and Lamb. Fish fried just right, taste of freshness and tender, sauce balanced with the fishy taste, perfect but not for eater preferring strong taste. The chicken with the burnt rosemary over dish was tender with marvelous taste of baked chicken. Usually for health sake I skip the skin, but for this dish only the bones were left. Lamb was divine. So tasty and tender, in my mouth I refused to chew and swallow. I wanted it to last in my mouth. All the side dishes were amazing. The mashed potato was smooth with mini potato chunks. The best potato I have ever tasted. Too full for dessert, but I believed strongly that those would be great, too. Atmospheric restaurant with a magnificent chimney with a real fire. The staff are super efficient and pleasant. Food is rustic and very well done. Decent selection of wine by the glass. Memorable for being unusual! Went there for a corporate event. The setting is amazing with a fireplace and a very noce open grill.

The set menu was an artichoke soup and a veal roast.

The soup was OK, I just hate when you market a dish as truffle artichoke soup and then you go searching for that truffle taste which is no where to be found.

The veal roast was cooked to perfection. It lacked seasoning though and the jus was runny and missing the bold flavours you expect from a veal jus.

Will I come back? Maybe, probably not. The food and staff are great. We had the set menu with Cod and butternut squash soup. We also ordered the lobster special of the day. The waiter helped choose excellent wine options. The food was delicious and cost about 73 per person with two bottles of wine on a table of 5.

I started with eggs filled with crabs and then for the main course beef with shallot sauce, mushrooms and potatoes pure. The fish plate was same delicious and very colourful as well. This is one of the gastronomic restaurants that have the better relation between price and valuetaste.

The place was fully booked and when you see the dinning room like this, it makes the experience even better. The last thing to congratulate is the server, which is serving to 40 people in the same time and he is always on top of this game energic, funny and super responsive. Outstanding French cuisine. The food was top notch and presentation was delightful. For appetizers I had the mackerel, crab ravioli, and scallop. The mackerel was smoked and came with vegi, herbs, and very tasty complementing cream sauce. We ordered their Sea Bass, pork roasted since 8 AM, and Pigeon not on the menu. Each one is unique and exceptional in taste.  The waiting staff spoke fluent English and were very friendly.

The restaurant is small and fills up quickly.  Highly recommend making reservation from their website. It is very easy. We had the chef menu and it was very delicious. The service was also excellent. We would definitiv recommend the restaurant! The food was pretty good. I ordered a set from the lunch menu. I had the pigeon pate, beef cheek, and the rice pudding. They were all great. Would highly recommend it. Unique and very tasty cuisine. Not too pretentious which is a good thing  you can actually eat there, not degustate.
Personal recommendations are sea bass, vitello tonnato and lemon desert.
Vine from tresoir section is a gem, but all others are also good.","Monday: Closed

Presentation of the dishes was chic. Setting was beautiful too, like something from a movie. The lovely female waiter was so kind as well.
The cocktails could be fresherhave more of a kick, but the food trumps any drawback with the drinks.
Overall, fantastic dining. This restaurant didn't meet our expectations. The snails were disappointing, and while the duck was decent, the service was lacking. The crme brle tasted like it had gone bad, so I didn't eat it. We experienced long wait times, and it felt like the waiter was rushing to get rid of us. On the positive side, the wine was excellent, and the prices were reasonable. A nice choice to go if you want taste traditional French food. We ordered the Foie Gras, the onion soup and snails for the starter. And beef steak, brass And duck drumstick for the main dishes. They are really delicious! Here is a fantastic spot for good food in Paris. The location is very convenient, situated in a vibrant area that's perfect for peoplewatching while you enjoy your meal. The food is topnotch, with each dish bursting with flavor and authenticity. The staff here are wonderful  friendly, efficient, and always eager to ensure you have a great experience. A mustvisit for anyone who loves good food and a pleasant atmosphere. We had an amazing dinner. We each ordered the Entre  Plat  Dessert. Everything was absolutely delicious and the presentation of the food was great. The service was excellent. Highly recommend this restaurant.","Monday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM

Manna Restaurant,"44 Rue de Lourmel, 75015 Paris, France",4.4,48.8478056,2.289722199999999,"Great taste and quality food! I was craving some Korean cuisine, so I came to this place and I was more than happy. The chicken here is amazing, because it reminds of 1990s old school fried chicken from Seoul. So if yall crave some nostalgic old Seoul food, strongly recommended.  HHOORRRAAYYy!!! I finally get to eat authentic Korean food! OOHh it was so yummy and tasteful!  I have  
Hot bibimbap with beef and Pago Juice can.
I love the Kimchi!!!

The restaurant was pretty small to me and was nice to have extra room in the back. It took awhile for me to get my turn for table. I understand with large group of people are coming in and I'm by myself. The waitress was amazing and nice she can speak English.

I thought their outside sign was kind of small or hard to spot them right away. I realize they are in small area. One of the better korean restaurants in Paris. This time we tried the crab soup, two person portion. I away like to order these big pots of soup to share with another person. Blue crab and vegetables, slightly spicy. Heated continuously and warmed on your table. So the food stay warm to taste good. A cold crab soup will be too fishy otherwise. Its hearty and comforting even in warm weather IMHO. For 3 people, we shared bulgogi beef and nengmyeon cold noodles on a hot summer day, it was perfect! Food tastes really good and service was fast. We came here mainly for the cold noodles as there is only a few Korean restaurants serving this dish  The quality of food served had deteriorated. I lived here about 7 years ago and it was one of the best Korean restaurants in the neighborhood. However, during my recent visit, I was shocked by how bad the crpe was in the lunch menu. It was so dry and tasteless, like chewing cardboard. The beef main dish was also not good. Meat was dry, but seasoning was greasy yet bland and quite sweet. The lunch menu was around 1823. But I would prefer to pay more money to get better quality food. I will probably visit again at dinner to see if I should remove this restaurant from my list...","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 7:00 – 10:30 PM

I would have liked to try all the entrees. The riz au lait was  I didnt know anything about this place before going there, but seems like in 2018 it was a Michelin rated restaurant. My wife and I had kimchi jiggae and bulgogi, and we were both pleasantly surprised. The kimchi jiggae paired extremely well with the bulgogi. I would definitely recommend these two dishes as a pairing, but beware, the kimchi jiggae is a bit spicy. I wish there was delicious Korean cuisine restaurants in Texas, like this one. Loved every single bite of the food here!!! Favourites were japchae, the pajeon and the stir fried pork! Japchae was flavoured very well and the pajeon was super crispy. The pork slices in the stirfried pork dish was super thin and cooked real good.

A definite must try if you are looking for legit korean food in Paris. The service was great! Menu is simple and they have the essential korean dishes. The food was clean and good, but not super impressive. I would definitely recommend. Seems to get busy so it should be best to reserve ahead of the visit. Very tasty and cozy korean spot in Paris. I would definitely recommend the fried korean galette and the beef tartare as starters, they were really delicious. As for the main, I wasnt too impressed with the salmon bowl but the pork was great.","Monday: Closed

Laï-Laï Ken,"7 Rue Sainte-Anne, 75001 Paris, France",4.4,48.8658004,2.3350601,"We went there during lunch hour, super packed but service was fast! We had dumplings for starters, very delicious. Then we shared the spicy miso ramen, broccoli and mushrooms stir fry, and also slow cooked pork i think its called buta kakuni. I couldnt recommend the pork enough, so soft, tender and super tasty! Just had a delightful meal at Lai Lai Ken!

The service was efficient and quick  leaving me feeling content and satisfied. While the decor is a bit plain and the lighting too bright at night the food more than makes up for it!  The fried chicken is an absolute musttry and the wonton soup is perfect for warming up in winter.  Overall, a great spot with excellent valu for money!  Contrary to what many people say, this is not a japanese restaurant, but an asiatic one.

The food was good, it had good taste and good quantity.

However, as youll see in the picture, the gyozas were stuck together, which is not great.
Unfortunately, the mapo tofu was not spicy, adapting to the local palate is good, but they went a bit too far here.

And finally the price was a bit excessive, as it ended up costing 21 for a meal with almost no meatfish, which is normally what makes a meal expensive For years I've looked for good ramen in Paris and I think that finally I found it. The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic, mixing France and Japan with a cosy environment where finally conversation are possible without shouting. I think the price is a bit higher than the competitors on the same street but definetly there is a reason and it remains affordable and proportionate to the quality of the food. I ordered an ebi yakisoba that was very mildly seasoned. It had the wok hay char which was nice, but the overall experience was underwhelming. It's also not cheap for what it is, even the normal yakisoba was about 1314. However, the service was quick and they were very nice and polite.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:45 PM, 6:30 – 10:30 PM

Veal was so fresh, soft and perfectly cooked. Scallops delicious. Kind and attentive waiters and staff. After reading reviews on this restaurant we decided to try as we had Vegan and Gluten Free dietary requirements. Staff reassured me that my meal was Gluten free, but proceeded to give me a vinaigrette salad which is not gluten free, vinegar is not gluten free. Disappointed that these needs couldn't be met efficiently, especially for the price of the food. Service was fantastic apart from this, worth a try if you eat meat and have no allergies. This is our first time in Paris and by far the best meal we have had. We do not speak French but felt very comfortable with the service we received and to top it all off the food was absolutely excellent. I will recommend this restaurant to anyone who is coming to Paris! Friendly staff. However, it is filled with food that is close to French home cooking and perhaps that is why it is filled with only older locals. It doesn't have a French feel and is not good for the price. Honestly if u North American food will be taste very plain for us i didnt like anything and special menu of the day tuna fish was just so dry. Steak was okay nothing compared American with all good review I disappointed I dont like nothing even salmon tartare was taste mayonnaise not good I dont know maybe they pay for reviews but it not best and all mans workers except are server was staring at my friend wrong way very impolite they staring so much make us uncomfortable place is so small for price we pay could be better specially when they called themself  French restaurant portions small drinks expensive.

Highly recommend this place. Have been multiple times and have never been disappointed.  The service is always friendly with a laugh and smile.  The food is fresh and tasty with generous portion sizes.   Must not miss! Absolutely loved this place and would highly recommend it to everyone. Service was fantastic.

For finishing we asked for a crme brle with pistachio.

Incredibly attentive and accommodating staff. We were given a small history of the house as well as a very through description of the wonderful food. They accommodated my husband's vegetarian diet and it was equally as delicious as everything else and the bartender made us some amazing Mocktails. Best experience at a restaurant we've ever had in all of Paris Recently I had a pleasure of dining at this restaurant, and It was one of the best fine dining experience ive had in Paris.

Staff went above and beyond to make our dinner unforgettable. Many thanks! Very nice experience in one iconic building in paris.

It was an overwhelming experience last nite that 3 courses of meals turned out to be 7 dishes with surprising presentations and quality. Even every meals even the entree and mains were small serve. We were full. Would highly recommend to do five course to make the dinner more complicated. Had absolutely delightful experience at the restaurant. The food was delicious, and don't get fooled by the small portions  after the whole set I was definitely good to skip breakfast the day after.
Very yummy, and the tastes opening more at every stage and each new one completing and building up on the previous one.

Kohyang,"6 Rue du Général Estienne, 75015 Paris, France",4.7,48.8440964,2.2842264,"A huge fan of Korean culture, including music, dramas, and especially food, I was delighted to discover this amazing Korean restaurant in a quiet neighbourhood. The food  Seafood pancake, Samgyeopsal, and Sesame ice cream  was exceptional, and the service was fantastic! I really appreciated the recommendations of the staff who were very warm, welcoming and helpful.  
I can't wait to go back again.
NB There's air conditioning, which is a huge plus. I had lunch here, enjoying the Korean food, which was genuinely authentic. The dishes were fantastic, bursting with flavor and made with quality ingredients. Every bite was a delight, making it a memorable dining experience. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for truly delicious Korean cuisine! When pass in front of a Korean restaurant and you see that all the clients eating were Korean, it was a invitation for me to try it and I loved it. Great typical food, well cooked and presented! The service was also nice. It was a very good experience and I hope you enjoy it too! Found this place by chance. It was first experience of Korean food for me and my wife and I can say, that we were lucky to try this food here and enjoyed our dinner a lot. First of all, as newcomers, we asked waiter what we should try and it was best choice. Unfortunately I have forgotten names of dishes, but in such places is to ask what best dishes to try. Liked experience a lot. Enjoyed that meat was cooked in front of me and all the entremets we received. Taste of some probably could be to spice for unprepared person, but I liked everything and meat was superb. Also enjoyed a talk with owner after our meal, it was really very pleasant. My recent visit to Kohyang left me deeply disappointed and frustrated. As soon as I entered the restaurant, I sensed judgment from a nonKorean waiter who scrutinized my friend and me from head to toe. It looked like he was trying to figure out where we were from. Even though we made it clear that there were two of us, he just ignored us and acted like he didn't get it. We tried FOUR times to talk to him, and he responded in English at the end. Even though we were the only ones waiting to be seated, it was so strange how the waiter couldn't understand simple french such as deux personnes

Once seated, the bad treatment didn't stop, as this waiter kept ignoring us and chatting with other tables nearby. It was only when a Korean lady came and assisted us with our order. Our main courses came without the side dishes, and when we asked for sauce and extra items, we had to wait even longer. This whole experience left us feeling really frustrated and annoyed.

I felt like the waiter was discriminating against us, which made this the worst dining experience I've ever had. My friend, who was with me, wasn't Korean or French, but we both felt like we were treated unfairly. I hope that management will take my comments seriously and address these issues to make sure that all customers are treated with the respect and professionalism they deserve!


After reading your reply, I must express my disappointment with your attitude as a restaurant owner. I want to clarify that upon entering your restaurant, we greeted with ""Bonjour."" Also, we did not raise our voices at anyone. I am very distracted by your distortion of the facts. As customers, we understand what it means to be busy and when we're being intentionally ignored. We never believed we were more important than others. All we sought was equal treatment. A simple apology would have sufficed!  Thank you, but we cannot take the risk of returning. No, we have decided never to come back, and we will share everyone we know about our experience.","Monday: Closed

Service was relatively fast and friendly, but I wouldnt define it as high end.
We ordered the cordon blue that was delicious as well as the round croissant with eggs and salmon. Dessert absolutely FABULOUS! We had the Mount Blanc and I would recommend it to absolutely everyone! Staff were really friendly. Made us feel very welcome. Hot chocolate was divine, best of my life but would recommend sharing with a friend even if youre a chocolate lover as it is very rich. Great range of pastries and other food too. Beautiful venue. Angelina Paris is a quintessential Parisian experience. The moment you step inside, you're transported to a world of elegance and oldworld charm. The Mont Blanc, the star of the show, was absolutely divine. It perfectly balanced the sweetness of the chestnut cream with the light meringue. A true delight for any dessert lover.
The French toast was a pleasant surprise. While the exterior was golden and crispy, the center was a bit drier than expected. Nonetheless, it was still enjoyable. The hot chocolate was undeniably rich and decadent, with a velvety texture. However, it was incredibly sweet, almost to the point of being overwhelming. Be prepared for a sugar rush!
The ambiance of the tea room is undeniably charming, with its ornate decor and soft lighting. The service was competent, though not particularly exceptional. Overall, Angelina Paris is a mustvisit for those seeking a taste of Parisian luxury, but be prepared for a hefty price tag to match the experience. Arriving for a late breakfast, I found this place to be a gem that exceeded my expectations. It had been on my researched and saved list of places, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. The classic and beautiful decor set a charming ambiance. The service was topnotch  professional, welldressed, and the staff knew their roles impeccably. The food was outstanding, living up to its slightly higher price point with quality that matched. The breakfast menu was exceptional, offering a variety that left me thoroughly satisfied.

Additionally, they have a shop located in front where you can purchase pastries and other homemade products, adding to the overall experience and convenience of the visit. There was a small queue, but we were in in less than 15 minutes 1pm, Saturday, Sept 2024.

L'Orangerie,"31 Av. George V, 75008 Paris, France",4.9,48.8688845,2.3002625,"Absolutely great experience
We had the pleasure of dining in this wonderful restaurant. It was a truly memorable experience. The food was exceptionally delicious, the wine pairing outstanding and the service impeccable.
And while not cheap the price is reasonable compared to other restaurants in Paris in the same class.
Thank you to Christopher, for the wonderful service  unfortanetly I didn't catch the name of your female colleague The food was amazing and the service exceptional! They were very accommodating of our dietary restrictions. Definitely one of the best dining experiences I have ever had! We came to France for our honeymoon and this was our first Michelinstarred dining, one of 9 around France during our trip. Out of sheer luck in timing, we caught LOrangerie when it was upgraded from a 1star to a 2star Michelin restaurant earlier in the year. Located inside the Four Seasons George V, the restaurant has just 6 tables inside with large windows facing the beautiful courtyard of the hotel and Le Cinq, the 3Michelin starred restaurant next door. The amount of money the hotel spends on flowers daily is astronomical but the opulence shows as is beautiful.

To start, this place is underrated. The Chef provides 3star quality food at 2star pricing. When we were done with our honeymoon, 7 of the 9 Michelin trips were to 3starred restaurants and we thought LOrangerie was better than half of these at twothirds the price.

The pescatarian menu is inventive, well balanced in preparation and flavors, and creatively displayed. Most importantly, it was downright delicious. The simplest things like bread were served with seaweed butter which was full of umami and incredibly addictive. The baby squid with fresh herbs, watercress, and matcha was perfectly soft combining just the right amount of umami flavors. I can say that it was the best tasting squid Ive ever had in my life so far. Then the next course of green asparagus with cloudy rice fermentation and blended mousseline was perfectly cooked. Normally, asparagus is prepared with heavier elements such as butter and cream but this sauce was light, acidic, and counterbalanced by crunchy veggies. I probably had asparagus at every Michelin dinner during our trip and this was easily top 2, possibly even my favorite. Every dish kept hitting with the spider crab, the milky morels, langoustine, sea bream, and blue lobster. Both my wife and I were blown away by the flavors.

This great momentum was slowed when the desserts came as the two courses lacked the flavors of the savory courses prior. Perhaps something with a bit more citrous and acid to lighten the palate and start the salivation as the Pompona vanilla vacherin with candied Carpentras strawberries lacked depth of flavor and finishing the dinner for something richer and sweeter than a Samana chocolate and sea grapes?

Beyond the food, the staff here were wonderful. They are friendly, genuine, inquisitive, and caring. When I was looking through the wine list and commenting at the amazing prices compared to the US, they even brought over the larger wine list from Le Cinq for me to browse while dining. The next night, we were back at the hotel to dine at Le Cinq and when I walked past some of the staff on my way to the bathroom, they remembered my face and asked how our dinner was going at Le Cinq. The server even remembered that I was wanting to try a Coche Dury Meursault and asked if I had gotten it at Le Cinq. They made us feel like friends who were checking in to see how we were doing even when we werent dining there.

This is an exceptional restaurant, especially for its price. If they continue this path and fine tune the dessert, 3stars may be coming their way in a few years. Were planning on coming to this restaurant every time were in Paris and to say hello again to the wonderful staff.

A bientot! I went there twice this week. Because the first experience was so good, I booked another one two days later. The food is excellent, the service is very nice. Each dish is the ingenuity of the chef, plus the careful interpretation of the waitress, and more importantly, the taste of each dish is great and unique! Michelin 
This restaurant is located in the beautiful Four seasons hotel. The entrance is breathtaking. The restaurant is very elegant. The food was amazing. Its a seafood tasting which was a first for me because I love meat but this restaurant did not disappoint. The way the chef put mixed and combined different types seafood with the different spices was  amazing. The flavors are soo unique. I loved the blue lobster dish. The desserts were amazing as well.

Entres are generous, better to be shared. Excellent meals!! It definitely reminded me of Korean food in Korea. We finish every single thing of the plate. We do offer great portion. We will definitely come back when we miss authentic Korean food. Highly recommended. The taste is amazing omg, just go and try it!!
We ordered the Korean flavor and the lamb, believe me they will surprise you.
But the pork we ordered only had two ribs  in the pics ...... a bit strange Visited on a Friday evening and ordered bbq. Experience was almost like dining in a restaurant in Korea! Lots of side dishes and they even served us complimentary dwaenjang guk Korean bean paste soup.

We also ordered cold noodles and it was very good.

Overall a good experience! Would come back again for sure when we crave kbbq.

Also they take Amex. My favourite Korean restaurant in Paris!
Highly recommend!!! Love all the side dishes as they really taste like authentic homemade grandma style ones. And the meat is always on point.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:00 PM, 6:30 – 10:00 PM

Brasserie Bellanger,"140 Rue du Faubourg Poissonnière, 75010 Paris, France",4.7,48.8809206,2.3500288,"Food This has to be one of my favorite restaurants in Paris that weve been to. Their flank steak was perfectly rare and their garlic parsley butter complimented the steak so well. Their french fries were SO addicting and flavorful, and this is coming from someone who doesnt even like them in general  I honestly could not stop eating them! Also, their snails and beef tartare had amazing flavor and seasoning. Everything we ordered was perfectly seasoned and had amazing flavors! Definitely the French food experience we were looking for!

Service Our waiter was one of the kindest and most attentive waiters weve had! We definitely didnt experience any typicalrude French service that France is typically known for.

Ambiance Felt like a cozy diner experience with highquality food! It also seemed like a favorite for locals. Good food served in this traditional Parisian brasserie. Menu offers a variety of options at very good price. Staff is nice. Few seatings available outside. Booking can be made ahead. Suitable for groups. Great place, amazing value for money I thoroughly recommend the duck breast it was absolutely exquisite! For desert we had Parisbreast and cherry clafoutis and they were both very tasty although Parisbreast was a little bit too sweet.
All of that staff were very friendly and attentive, which completed the atmosphere.
We paid 61 for two main courses, two deserts and a large bottle of sparking water, which I think is amazing value for money for Paris. Steak needed some salt but was perfectly cooked medium and the fries were good but not sure how fresh they were. Our server was lovely and the wine was pay for what you drink which we enjoyed! Will go back again. Very nice French brasserie with very nice food and pastries. Can highly recommend this restaurant when in the neighborhood of Paris Nord train station. Excellent service also but my only gripe is that the tables are too close together. We had to squeeze in between other tables to sit down at our table. It would be a nicer affair if there was more room between tables. Anyway, the Paris Brest dessert was to die for, excellent! We all ordered it, all 4 of us.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Love the vibes, services and great food here!
It's a small yet cozy place, reservation would help you to secure good seats. We are lucky that we got two bar seats! Stumbled across this restaurant on our first night in Paris. The food, service and atmosphere were incredible. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Paris. We were lucky to get a table for four when arriving around dinner time, but this place is indeed small so would recommend a reservation ahead of time if possible. We ordered Escargots as an appetizer, and beef, stuffed duck breast Wednesday special, sea bass, and steak as entrees. The duck breast is a bit dry, but all other dishes had great flavor and tender texture as they should be. The crme brle at the end has appropriate level of creamy sweetness and crispiness. Highly recommend for a casual French cuisine experience. Very nice and cozy restaurant.
For starter we chose escargot and mussel which their tastes were unbelievable delicious and above our expectation.

Our main courses we chose duck breast which was mixed with sweet sauce and it was  delicious again. My friends ordered beef steak which was larger than their expectation , they were only rare, medium rare and medium. My friends told me that it is delicious and worth trying.

For dessert creme brullee was nice and not too sweet. Icecream nougat was also delicious, the tastes were mixed with sour from berry and sweet from milk icecream.

Will definitely visit again next time very good food and good service!
the confit de canard texture was nice, the crispy skin, tender meat, and juicy fats of the duck was perfect.

another dish i order is the marget de canard, the duck breast is medium rare which is just nice and the sauce was flavourful with some fruity taste

staff was very patient and helpful to explain in english","Monday: 12:00 – 4:00 PM, 5:00 – 10:00 PM

Le MaZenay,"46 Rue de Montmorency, 75003 Paris, France",4.6,48.8636402,2.3533729,"Our experience at dinner was excellent, in fact I even had lunch the same day to sample the lunch menu and both were extremely good with a stand out mention for the fresh herbs used in the salad an extraordinary combination that really delivered a new TWIST on traditional French cuisine. I discussed this with the chef and it was very excited to get the feedback as I think it is a signature part of his cuisine. Exceptional service also from his wife and the other brigade members.

We will definitely be back definitely worth a detour! Love their Vietnamese Salad and their steak, the Bordeaux wine they recommended was ok, will definitely want to try their different menus next time. We got so lucky finding this little gem.  Reservation is a must. The owners are obviously passionate about food and serving. My Scotish grouse with red wine sauce and grilled eggplants was probably the best meal of my 10day trip in France.  The wine list was also vast and very good. The place looks very inviting, being located on a small street in a touristy area.  The service is kind and not very formal.
The food was amazing, I really liked it.  Dishes weren't  ""super creative"" not like fine dining at all, but not quite ordinary either.  Interesting, original, with a twist, but simple and tasty  at the same time. Having finished both challenges all the Parisian stars under 365 days and all the 3 stars in France  follow me for all the reviews and updates Im now redoing most of them and testing some more Michelin.
I went to this one by chance, simply because I arrived way too late for the Michelin Star in front , and they were kind enough to accept me for a late lunch.
Whats interesting here?
I thought that I would appreciate more the meat the chef is a country guy who loves his game and it was the beginning of the season but surprisingly I loved his take on the sea. Especially with the usage of citrus not for acidity but for the fruit flavor. Its not very common and very pleasing.
The service is very nice, the staffing is normal for a standard Michelin. The nice touch is that the chef is active in the dining room, so you get to see and meet him.
The crowd was chilled. Family on holidays, friends and I guess people from the surrounding or working in the surrounding .

JJ Beaumarchais,"92 Bd Beaumarchais, 75011 Paris, France",4.9,48.8599086,2.3678246,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 4course dinner at JJ Beaumarchais. Seated at the patio window, we got to people watch and have our own little quiet cozy corner of the restaurant. My husband is not keen on seafood, yet he loved the meal, especially the cod! Everything was so delicious, cooked well with high quality fresh ingredients, and healthy. Nothing was overly salty nor greasy, and we left with happy tummies and wallet!. Definitely book a table here if you want to take a break from traditional French dishes. Extraordinary. The meal at JJ Beaumarchais was not only delicious but surprisingly healthy too. The choice of ingredients were dominated by vegetables and fish, and seasoning was used in moderation, so the meal was low in fat, salt, and cholesterol, yet achieved a level of satisfaction usually associated with heavier dishes. Service was friendly and efficient, and the environment was quite pleasant. Very reasonable prices too! All around excellent. We were looking for a special place to celebrate our time in Paris. JJ Beaumarchais caught our attention based on the comments of visitors and its rating on Google. We went to check it out and were intrigued by the fact that we would be served a menu chosen by the chef with 4 or 5 dishes specially prepared for each night. We added to the uncertainty and expectations of what would be served, observing the neighboring tables. The dishes that followed us on our unknown journey were compositions with fish, seafood and vegetables. An explosion of flavors with fresh ingredients, enhanced by the seasonings and sauces of the dishes. Highlights include the octopus with tempura, the flounder fish with roasted lettuce and a delicious dessert with cherry ice cream with a lemon mousse and a cupcake. Matching the spectacular dishes, the service staff is extremely attentive and thorough in their explanations, very friendly, offering excellent tips on pairing drinks with the dishes. Surrender yourself  to the atmosphere and flavors of JJB and make your time at the tables in Paris more special and unforgettable than ever. Now this is an experience. Elevated small plates focusing on seafood and vegetables. I could feel my palate expanding during this dinner.

One of our top culinary experiences in Paris, and thats saying something. Do yourself a favor and stop by JJ for a special night. This place is truly exceptional, I would give it more than 55 if possible. The quality and value of their food are unbeatable, with four courses costing 46, and five courses priced at 59. In addition, when we ordered a glass of wine, our waiter was generous with the pour.  We had missed our original lunch reservation due to a delayed flight, but we were delighted to have made it to dinner instead. The menu is a surprise blind menu, and changes daily based on the fresh ingredients available that day.  Each dish is distinct and flavorsome, but with all elements wellbalanced, such as the combination of asparagus, pistachio, and pumpkin seeds or beetroot, cherry, and tomato. My favorites were the langoustine bisque and grilled mackerel, but I can't wait to try their new menus in the future. Overall, a fantastic dining experience!","Monday: Closed

Loulou,"107 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France",4.1,48.86305559999999,2.3333333,"Worth the hype!! Food was delicious  vibes were incredible. A few notes

1. You NEED a reservation and it is incredibly hard to get one. It opens 2 weeks in advance and even though I checked the DAY OF, it was already booked up. We ended up using our hotel concierge to make the reservation, so if you have access to that kind of in definitely utilize it.

2. Would recommend going slightly earlier in the evening, before sunset, so you can enjoy the views as it transitions to evening time. We are at 930 so it was already very dark  still lovely but different experience

3. Our service was alright  waiter was not particularly helpful and a little bit short, but did an overall fine job.

4. Food  only complaint is that our pizza wasnt super hot when it came out. Flavor was AMAZING but I am very temp sensitive, so that was a little bit of a bummer. Recommendations are the truffle pizza, beef carpaccio, and the puff pastry dessert that you dip in chocolate

5. The wine I posted in the picture was delicious! Highly recommend  This was hands down the best restaurant experience that we had in all of Paris. Our waiter was incredible and kind. He had the best recommendations for food selections. The food was high quality and delicious. It was the best restaurant environment that we had encountered. 1010 we will be back every chance we get. I was a little worried that this would he a tourist trap given its location in the Louvre, but it ended up being one of the best dinners we had in Paris.

The vibes and the service were stellar. The food was delicious. We had the burrata salad, the pulpo, and the truffle
pasta, with sorbet for dessert. I get the sense that everything on the menu is amazing. Next time, Im definitely
getting the truffle pizza! While the food and ambiance at this restaurant were excellent, how we were welcomed into the restaurant was shockingly terrible. The two members of staff at the door are unfortunately unprofessional and clearly incompetent.  Their behavior completely ruined what could have been a pleasant experience. I expected much better. We had to wait to be seated, and the process was a bit disorganized. Our waiter seemed a little grumpy, which detracted from the experience. However, the food and drinks were 1010. Improving the service would make a big difference. Despite this, it's a beautiful place to have lunch on a spring or summer day.","Monday: 12:00 – 2:30 PM, 7:00 – 11:00 PM

La Coupole,"102 Bd du Montparnasse, 75014 Paris, France",4.4,48.84225459999999,2.327950599999999,"If you are Asian, I strongly recommend avoiding this restaurant due to their discriminatory treatment. I made a reservation for 1000 PM last Sunday, excited to try French cuisine. We arrived at 930 PM but were completely ignored while other guests were seated. I thought it might be because we arrived early, so we waited until 1000 PM, yet still received no attention.

After waiting until 1020 PM, one of the servers finally approached but prioritized taking orders from two ladies behind us. I stood up to seek help, and she eventually noticed when I went straight to the reception. She seated my husband and me, along with the other two ladies, at a table in the middle, but the servers continued to ignore us while serving the tables beside us. When I inquired about this, they claimed they were too busy.

After I complained to the manager, they offered us a table, but who wants to eat there after being treated like that? Why were they too busy for us but not for others?

The service we received was unacceptable and felt distinctly discriminatory. It was clear they didnt care about us as Asian customers. If you want to enjoy your time in Paris, I suggest staying away from this restaurant to avoid a negative experience. Nice place for varieties of seafood. This, incredibly, huge restaurant has been around for decades. Chicken breast is soft and juicy. One dish may not be enough to fill one meal.  Order a plate of seafood to share before the main course. 3course meal is highly recommended. A very traditional French restaurant. Has been there forever. Good for oysters. However, I go there once a decade to have the escargots, the mussels and the profiteroles and they are simply wonderful!!! The art deco design of the dining room is undoubtedly the highlight of this restaurant. While the cuisine reflects the standard offerings typical of chain establishments, the dishes are still enjoyable. The service staff are polite and helpful, but due to the restaurant's large size and numerous tables, it can sometimes be challenging to get a waiter's attention. Historic brasserie in the heart of Paris, exceeded all expectations with its authentic atmosphere and classic French cuisine. We enjoyed a wonderful lunch that perfectly blended tradition with the charm of local Parisian life.

We started with the French onion soup, which was richly flavored and deeply satisfying, with just the right amount of melted cheese on top. The crab and mussels were fresh and expertly prepared, while the salmon was perfectly cooked, delivering a beautiful balance of flavor and texture. Every dish was a testament to the kitchen's mastery of classic French dishes.

What made the experience even more special was the vibrant atmosphere. The restaurant was filled with locals, giving us an authentic taste of Parisian dining culture. The art deco surroundings and bustling yet relaxed vibe added to the charm, making La Coupole a mustvisit for anyone seeking an iconic Parisian dining experience.

Well definitely return for another meal!","Monday: 8:00 AM – 11:00 PM

CoCo,"Opéra Garnier, 1 Pl. Jacques Rouché, 75009 Paris, France",3.5,48.8718936,2.3324214,"The pancakes were amazing! So good!
The other food was very good too, but I definitely recommend the pancakes  The lobster roll was a lot of roll and very little lobster, but still good. Although for that price we did expect more lobster.
The service was very nice as well, our waiter was very friendly and gave good advice. And because of the live music which we could hear everywhere on the terrace but wasnt too loud because they used boxes on the terrace the atmosphere was great too.
The prices were a bit on the high side but because of the quality it wasnt too bad.
Would definitely recommend! Fantastic dinner with great friends. Wonderful service. Very reasonable prices for the food and wine. Extensive wine selection. the only thing I didn't like was the portion of lamb chops. Very small and not enough to fill me up. I was excited to take my 9 year old to a ""fancy"" dinner here, but I left feeling disappointed.  She had a great time, so that is what matters the most.

1. I ordered a med rare steak, and it came out before our drinks. Well done.  Less than 3 minutes after I had ordered it.

2. They corrected the steak but didn't bring back my silverware.  I waited nearly 6 minutes, and the steak was then cold.

3. They said they were bringing bread, but it arrived just before dessert and after our food had been removed.

4. The entire dinner felt VERY rushed.  We booked a 6pm dinner so we could beat the rush and take our time. We were in and out in under an hour.

5. When the bill was dropped off, the waiter kindly told us that a tip was an appreciation of the service.

The good
The atmosphere was beautiful, my daughters chicken was delicious, and the amazing man singing live music was the best touch of all.

Don't take it off your list. Just be aware! This was, without a doubt, the worst meal we've had in Paris so far. Don't be deceived by the beautiful scenery and decorthe food quality falls far short of acceptable. I was utterly shocked by the 125 rack of lamb we were served. While some fat on lamb is expected, having threequarters of it be inedible is unacceptable, especially at this price point. When we raised our concerns with the waitress, we were dismissively told, 'lamb is fatty,' with no acknowledgement of the issue. Despite our disappointment, we paid the full amount, accepting our misfortune. The small portion of meat that was edible was severely underseasoned, though the accompanying salt, pepper, and side sauce somewhat salvaged it. It's unclear whether the problem was poor fat rendering or simple carelessness, but we were thoroughly disappointed. The only positives were the good wine and the friendly staff. The ambiance was pleasant, but it's certainly not worth the price for the lamb chops. Took my daughter here to celebrate her birthday , it turns out to be a disaster.

The waitress was pushy and you can tell they will always ask you to order the expensive wine.
Food serving is small. The seabass comes with rice and no other sides. They make you pay extra for the sides. we ordered 2 beef fillet. The waiter mixed up my mediumwell with my friend rare medium. Service and attentiveness simply wasnt there. Food is average and its really not worth the .

We had 4 adults squeezed to a small table. No space or basket offered to put my tote bag so I had put my bag on the floor. Ended up my bag was smeared with some butter on the floor.

The worst is yet to come. I was locked in the washroom. The lock was stuck and handle came off when I tried getting out!! Fortunately I got my phone with me and called my Daughter who came over to help. The French guy outside who spoke no English kept speaking. I was really frightened and sweating inside the stuffy toilet. Finally after a few struggle, I came out.
When I complained to the lady manager , she was unsympathetic and dismissed me.

Totally disappointing.","Monday: 12:00 – 3:00 PM, 7:00 – 11:00 PM

Le Gentil,"26 Rue Surcouf, 75007 Paris, France",4.8,48.8602491,2.3094817,"Le Gentil in Paris is a unique restaurant that beautifully blends French and Japanese cuisines, offering a creative and memorable dining experience. The dishes are not only delicious but also presented with artistic flair, sometimes incorporating 3D art, making each plate a visual delight as well as a treat for the palate. The pricing is very reasonable considering the high quality and craftsmanship of the food.

The restaurant attracts a diverse crowd of Japanese, international, and French customers, which speaks to its broad appeal and excellent reputation. However, due to its popularity, its always busy, so reservations are essential to ensure you get a table. Such an amazing small, family owned restaurant featuring a fusion of French and Japanese flavors. Each dish is perfectly executed and the owners couldnt be more welcoming.

While you cant go wrong with your order, the shrimp appetizer and basque cheesecake dessert are absolutely divine! Cant wait to come back next time Im in Paris. Such a cosy little restaurant with a great menu, atmosphere and service!

We had a wonderful time dining here! Small restaurant serving a small menu with a Japaneseinspired dish in each course. Service is swift and friendly. The ambience is lovely and they seem to attract locals as well as visitors.

Everything was done with care and attention, and the taste is overall good. Although I feel there are too many types of sauces and ingredients on each dish so not everything is in perfect harmony. Personally I prefer simpler dishes with a focus on the main ingredient. Hidden gem in the 7th district.
Our experience was excellent!
The restaurant is neat, simple and elegant.
The service was great!
We had as starters 
 crab croquettes so good! fresh ingredients and well fried
 pork trotter I was doubtful at first but it was so good !

Not only does it have a great view because it is on a high floor, but it also has the sea indoors with sharks and stingrays swimming around. The shark is a gentle black tip reef shark, but do not put your hands in the tank as safety accidents may occur. Occasionally, stingrays will hit the surface and make fun of you. In addition, the butterfly koi and cichlid tanks were beautifully decorated. If you pass by Gapyeong near Seoul on the weekend, it might be a good idea to stop by. It's not cheap, but it's good to go with kids, parents, and boyfriend.

This is Ade restaurant.
Personally, the table next to the swing chair is my favorite spot.

Café de Flore,"172 Bd Saint-Germain, 75006 Paris, France",3.9,48.8541588,2.3326046,"Honestly, this place is way overrated from all the social media buzz.
You can get better and freshoutofthe oven croissants elsewhere. Croissants were quite hard. We ordered the eggs as well, and they were way under done!
Coffee was mediocre.

The only buzz here is the famous hot chocolate and cream. Did it live up to our expectations? Probably not...was too sweet for my liking.

We decided to visit this cafe due to all the buzz it has gotten recently from a certain Netflix drama..
But was the food worth it? No. You can get better and cheaper breakfast elsewhere.
Only positive was the waiter we got quite a rarity to find a polite and friendly waiter in Paris! We heard this was the best cafe in Paris.  Well it definitely was the best cafe on our trip.  The hot chocolate was phenomenal, the best Ive ever had.  The quiche and the rest of the food were also great.  The staff provided world class service.   A lot of influencing happening all around us, entertaining to see it in action. The best cafe on Saint Germain des Pres in my opinion. Stylish and traditional cup, cutlery, location and service. All of it adds to the experience and you get a good breakfast in a location where you say Im in Paris. The croissants are classic, good bread and eggs are cooked well. The hot chocolate with cream seems to be the specialty here and its one of the best I had. This is a must for me whenever I go to Paris as I went here twice in three days. Theres a lot of people taking pictures around you of the cafe, themselves so be ready to be filmed  Went for breakfast around 11ish. Few items were already finished.
The food overall tastes above average but the prices are just ridiculous.

The coffee tastes really bad and that too in such a small cup priced at 9 euros.

We were visiting Paris for few days so we tried few more cafe's nearby, and they have better quality with significantly cheaper prices. Great hot chocolate with whipped cream, that is for sure. Amazing ambiance. Is the food and drinks worth the price? No. You can definitely find a cheaper menu across Paris that has equally great dishes. If you really want to go, I say eat a pastry beforehand and go only for drinks. The hot chocolate is velvety and the whipped cream honestly tastes like it was milked right before it got to our table it was tooooo good.","Monday: 7:30 AM – 1:30 AM

While the coffee is certainly above average for Paris, it doesn't quite reach the heights of worldclass brews. It's a nice spot to relax and peoplewatch. The best part is its location in a beautiful park, which makes it a perfect place to unwind. Drinks were very average, literally something you can make at home yourself haha. Seating place in the garden was very limited as well and dont bet your chances on getting an empty one during the weekend. The park benches make for quite good alternatives.

But I must say I really like the logo on the cup. The only good thing really  This Cafe Kitsune was perfect. The Coffee was amazing and they really have a universal flavor profile. No matter where you go the flavor is consistent Gotta love that. This location is perfect because after you get your coffee the park is right there where you sit and enjoy the view or find a quiet corner to read. Visited a few of the Kitsun cafes in Paris, the coffee is so smooth and not overly roasted, I am a big fan. Looking at the previous photos of the location it appears the space has been scaled back to consist of an order and take away shop with only outdoor seating facing the park. Note Google Maps may lead you to the street entrance which is no longer open so you must walk around to the other side of the building to find the shop and enter. Recommended if in the area. One of the best locations a cafe can have! In center of palace royal with a great view of the garden. Staff were extra nice and the flat white was delicious.","Monday: 9:30 AM – 7:00 PM

The Caféothèque of Paris,"52 Rue de l'Hôtel de ville, 75004 Paris, France",4.2,48.85445250000001,2.3557667,"We recently visited this coffee roastery and shop that offers a selection of African and American coffees, with a special focus on Guatemalan beans. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable, which made the experience enjoyable. They offer more than a dozen types of singleorigin beans, but only two were available for tasting, which felt limiting. Prices range 4.4010.00 for 100g .
We purchased four different kinds of beans to try both as espresso and drip coffee, but unfortunately, none met our expectations. The coffees either lacked complexity or were overly acidic, leaving us disappointed with the overall taste. While the variety and expertise are impressive, the actual flavors fell short for us. Amazing place to spend time. Coffee is great and they have small bites to eat. There is some comfy seating near the front and then as you move deeper into the Cafe there are lots more seats. Service is great, in both English and French. There is a piano as well, which was great to see someone playing.
It's an awesome place to read and study. A NatureLovers Haven with Freshly Roasted Coffee
My friend recently discovered a hidden gema naturefriendly cafe that offers an unforgettable coffee experience. The atmosphere is incredibly serene, with greenery all around and a cozy, ecofriendly vibe that instantly puts you at ease.
The freshness and depth of flavor in the coffee were unmatchedeach cup was rich, aromatic, and full of character. You can really taste the care and craftsmanship that goes into every brew.
Sitting back and enjoying a freshly roasted cup of coffee in such a beautiful, natureinspired setting was an absolute treat. If youre a coffee lover who appreciates a sustainable, naturefriendly environment, this cafe is a mustvisit. Ill definitely be back for more! Great place for coffee, every day you can try the variety of the day for coffee. Best coffee  Cappuccino so far in Paris. Highly recommend, great service and very friendly staff, multilingual as we don't really speak French but the staff speaks English and even Spanish, not sure what other languages are available but won't have issues at all if French is not your forte.
Great prices. Will be able to have. Abite, there is soup of the day and on our visit luckily got empanada served with salad empanada is like a Paty pastry filled in this case with either chicken or veggies. Offers also alternative milk, oats milk. We visited multiple times in or short visit to Paris. Superb coffee. One of the best. I could have stayed here all day.

I would definitely recommend this cafe to anyone looking for a place to relax and peoplewatch in Myeongdong. Myeongdong Caf, one of the most prominent tourist locations in South Korea, and we had dinner at the Myeongdong Cafe Restaurant. A few of the delicious meals are affordable. A lot of unusual menu items are also available,  bean noodles, fried chicken, and stirfried pig belly with vegetables. I recommend that vacationers make many trips to this cafe in the future. In addition to several quaint cafs, Myeongdong caf has a wide range of shopping and dining alternatives. If you're exploring Myeonydong's caf, this is a perfect place you visit. Myeongdong CafeCaf de Paris in Myeongdong Cafe is unique. We went there with our families while on vacation in South Korea from Canada.

Both the coffee and the banana bread were beautiful and tasty for a breakfast. Great vibe in the shop too! Highly recommend if youre looking for a brunch place in Paris  Modern and popular cafe. It can get very busy on weekends. Good coffee, good music. Expect to pay a one euro premium compared to other local cafes. No laptops. Love that. We come here very regularly and it is always busy. Queue is fasting moving and staff are friendly. Coffee is probably one of the best in Paris with 2 different blends to choose from. Cakes are also delicious. Coffee was excellent, best coffee we had in Paris. Roast and blend onsite, had the Italian blend. Staff were very attentive, service was first class. I had a cortado and carrot cake, which was an amazing combination of tastes and textures. The coffee is very foamy and pretty decorated.

The coffee was perfect, and we tried the Yakgwa and matcha tiramisu I love tiramisu and this was a really good combination, recommend going to this place after walking down or up to Montmartre. The staff were incredibly kind and friendly, will definitely go back when Im in Paris again   Incredible service and attention to detail. Such cute interior and zen atmosphere. Everything is delicious, the drinks and the sweet treats are amazing! One of the best Korean cafes in Paris! If you want your coffee in peace, this is your place. The Japanese design and peaceful environment allowed me to sip and think about my day before I ran outside. The coffee was strong but didn't taste strong and still was delicious. If you like syrups in your coffee they had a few flavors. A cozy refuge for incredible coffee in the 9th. It feels like the proprietor has invited you into her living room to enjoy a pace change, a nice conversation, and the kind of warmth you only get from good food made with love. The coffee is exquisitely roasted, light to medium, which makes Jijis work on the espresso machine really stand out. The espresso work is solidly third wave but the ease and softness of the space connotes a simpler, more casual time in high end coffee shops. This is really a special place, stop by early to avoid crowds. came here w friends today the lady at reception was so nice and its prolly the best cafe ive been at since living here no joke so glad we found this spot everything is delicious you cant go wrong !! she even slipped us a pistachio cookie it was very delicious you could really taste it and i was left feeling fuzzy and warm all day j thinking of this visit,, will definitely come again","Monday: 8:00 AM – 4:30 PM

MAEUM,"2 Rue de Lesdiguières, 75004 Paris, France",4.9,48.8519881,2.3666465,"This might be Londons best marinated raw crab!! Ma Eum in Pimlico serves up authentic Korean dishes. We started off with the makgeolli alcoholic beverage served in a teapot. The beef tataki was tender and delicious. Trying the soy marinated raw crab for the first time was an amazing experienceI absolutely loved it and highly recommend it. The Korean fried chicken in a sweet and spicy sauce was a definite winner, as always. We paired our dishes with flavourful kimchi fried rice and an incredible beef bulgogi bibimbap. Overall, Ma Eum is one of the best Korean restaurants Ive visited in London! This is a cute Korean cafe owned by the sweetest people in Paris. Ive gone frequently for the BTS events that they organize and you can tell how much effort that they put into these events. I always have a really fun time and feel very welcome. If you ever have the opportunity to go for one of the BTS events, you should definitely go. Make sure to reserve your spots fast on their website though, because they sell quick!

Even if you are not a fan of BTS, this cafe is not to be missed. The owners are so sweet and kind. You can really tell that they enjoy what theyre doing and they put in so much hard work and effort to create such a genuine and great experience every time that you go there. The food and drinks are as delicious as they are beautiful and the cafe is decorated with care and style.

I started learning Korean by myself 4 years ago, but Ive never had the confidence or opportunity to speak it with other people until I came here. The owners really make going to this cafe so special. If you are learning Korean you can practice with them and feel encouraged to continue studying. Ive always felt so welcome here as the owners remember you every time you come back. You can really tell how much they care about the people that come to their cafe. This cafe is truly a hidden gem and I would recommend visiting if you have the chance. Cannot recommend this caf enough! The decor and ambiance set up such a comfortable and comforting mood which was perfect to unwind and take a break from the city pace. Anyone can instantly notice the attention to detail from the owners to give customers the best experience. They also sell beautiful clothes, items and accessories, wonderfully curated! I purchased the prettiest glass which I use every single day now.

Also, if you're indecisive on the menu like me, trust the owners' recommendations! I was recommended the Korean plum tea  and I loved it! I got to taste the hodugwaja  pastries as well, so delicious!

Finally, the owners are truly so kind and lovely, they made me feel so welcomed and even took time to chat with me, which really shows how much they value their customers. Thank you so much!

What more can I say? I truly had the best healing time and if I lived in Paris I'd definitely be a regular. Can't wait to go back! A very enjoyable shop visit
First of all, maeum must be a mustvisit for every kpop fans! It's a bit of a shame that they don't take reservations, but it was acceptable and I only had to wait for about 20 minutes. It's not a big shop, it's even a bit small hahahahahaha. But the dcor is pretty pink and pink!
The price of the menu is acceptable, a little expensive, and there's not a lot to choose from, which is a pity. If you order a smoothie and a drink, it will cost over 10 euros per person.
The attitude is really super nice! We ordered a smoothie and ate it very slowly, then she came to care if it was not to our liking, nor if it was not tasty or something. But it was actually a bit cold because it was too cold hahahahaha, so she brought us a cup of hot water!!! Let us warm up! omg she was sososo sweeeeet.
The shop manager is purely Korean Before leaving, he will chat with you, giving you stickers and candies as little gift, and teach you a few words of Korean, which is really cute. He also gave us little BLACKPINK stickers because he knew we were here to travel.
All in all, it was a really good experience. If you like kpop and have enough time, you should definitely come there! I discovered MAEUM on Instagram several months ago and have been following along with their posts and stories ever since, hoping to get a chance to visit one day. I finally was able to visit and was not disappointed!

The shop is super cute. The decorations were beautiful and the atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. I had a blueberry bingsu, which was the most BEAUTIFUL dessert Ive ever had! It was also delicious 

The owners were truly some of the nicest people Ive met at a business in Paris! They were so kind, from offering me extra condensed milk for my bingsu to taking time to ask questions about me. I also got to practice a bit of my very, very limited Korean.  It seems like they truly see their customers as human beings, and not just as a means of income, and you can feel the difference. I will definitely be coming back here one day to have another  ! ","Monday: Closed

It mixes history and quality in a great way.
The part they could definitely improve is the kindness of the staff. No smile nor hello when you arrive. A bit touristy unfortunately but definitely a place to try. A must stop for coffee and tea lovers. It is so incredibly difficult to find rich velvety Cappuccino or Flat White in France but this place will not disappoint. The decor is absolutely beautiful. Old World Charm in its best edition. Will be back! The cafe has a nice atmosphere and vibe. But it is a bit pricey for the quality it offers. The Madeleines with chocolate sauce were not as good as I am used to from other places in the city. The double espresso was ok but again I had better.

All in all a good choice to flee from the rain before going to the Louvre, but don't expect the best food you ever had. The place is so whimsical. They have coffee beans in drawers and the traditional burlap sacks.

I ordered the cafe viennois and it was delectable. It was mostly whipped cream which is what I was feeling that day. It came with the usual tiny chocolate square.

I was only going to get a drink but oddly next to my seat, there was a platter of desserts inside a glass case. At first, I thought they were only for display and not fresh, but the server assured me it was all real. Since they all looked enticing, my friend and I decided to share one. We pointed to the one we wanted most on the count of 3, and thank god, it was the same tart. Suffice to say, we had good taste I especially loved the crunch of the pistachios. I visited a cozy cafe during my last holiday in Paris and absolutely loved its tranquil ambiance, classic decor, and delicious dessert and coffee. The cakes and ice cream were so mouthwatering and refreshing, especially after a tiring walking tour of the area. I highly recommend this cafe to anyone who wants to enjoy a peaceful and tasty break in Paris.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Like this one. It's a 4 cause the people are nice inside and the food wasn't gross.

But really, it's just a simple cafe with a simple menu selection. Something like the crazy croissant makes you think it's gonna be... crazy. It's really like your average croissant with eggs and a slice of turkey inside.

Food is very basic, the place is small but it turns over quickly. If you're a tourist, go experience a meal at a classic bistro instead. Great food. Small space but with excellent ventilation system. We couldn't smell the eggs cooking eventhough it is an open space and you can see the kitchen. The waiters are super friendly.
The only thing that I was uncomfortable with is the long line. People wait outside while you eat and they can watch you through the window. It felt a bit awkward. Great cafe! Pancakes were good, latte was well balanced, avocado toast was fresh. Great service, layout is done well for the small space, would love customs on the chair lol Delicious vegetarian options! It's a pretty small restaurant so if you want to skip the line, go right as they open up. I got a crazy stuffed croissant sandwich and the salad it came with was just bursting with flavour. The drinks were yummy and service was very fast. Definitely a recommended breakfastbrunch place in Paris if you're looking to be satiated until the afternoon. Glad we made it for breakfast today.

Amazingly fresh food and friendly environment.  Cant wait to come back.

So fantastic  They are extremely busy but still so polite and attentive. Food was very tasty. We had the Hemingway and chose the omelette which was delicious. Hot coffee   Highly recommend this amazing experience   We came here for brunch and had a lovely time. Our table was right at the front, allowing us to enjoy a delicious brunch while watching the street and people.  It was a wonderful atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and attentive, which made the experience even better. We really enjoyed the taste of the coffee as well. Even though the interior of the restaurant is small, it's definitely worth a look inside. My husband and young son and I had breakfast at this gorgeous Parisian establishment during our stay in winter. The hot chocolate was absolutely divine, as was the coffee, juice and all breakfast items we ordered. The breakfast we ordered was plentiful and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience there  a bucket list item of mine for a long time! Being winter the cafe wasnt packed which we loved, as we could immerse ourselves in the atmosphere of the cafe. Id definitely come back on our next trip to Paris! Very nice food, excellent service.
Our waiter was helpful, patient, friendly and funny which added a lot to the experience. I'm very happy he helped us and not the scowling person that was waiting on other guests by throwing menu's on their tables and endlessly clinging glass while cleaning tables.

Enjoyed our visit today, it is a bit out of the sightseeing area. Super service with Eka and nice coffee! We did have a nice moment in this little cafe. One of the best specialty coffeeshops in Paris! Amazing coffee! And look at this latte art its made with oat milk!","Monday: 8:00 AM – 12:00 PM, 12:30 – 6:00 PM

I ordered an espresso of the Ethiopian origin. It was flavourful, quite fruity.
The cardamom bun was also amazing. Soft, moist and absolutely scrumptious l.
Great service. Very small place great quality coffee and pastries. The babka roll was a bit dry by the cardamum roll was perfection. Really nice little coffee shop, not too busy, seems a hidden gem I think. Nice outside seating as well as some indoor seating. Thought it was independent but it was a small chain I think. Had an oat milk flat white, my go to back in the UK. Not the cheapest coffee at nearly 7, but really nice coffee beans used and overall one of the best oat milk flat whites Ive ever had. Highly recommended for any UK tourist if your into your oat flat whites. i was here with my parents, their coffee brews are pretty good! i had their cardamom roll , which was heated up slightly, it wasnt the freshest but still had a good cardamom flavour but it could definitely have more and be more spread evenly through the bun Very small, cozy place wirh delicious foods and drinks! I had a chaud Matcha Latte, it was perfectly slightly sweet and a banana bread fluffy, juicy and very tasty 1010! Would recommend","Monday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM

There are bakery options, but it's not a show. Just good! Limited seating available inside. Definitely a grab and go type of coffee shop, not to chill and stay inside. Had the pistachio latte and it was SUPER!! Place was a vibe but prices were pretty high for coffee We had coffee here for all 3 days in Paris. We tried the pistachio, salted caramel, and honeycinnamon latte. Their coffee is so smooth and the flavors blend perfectly. Its not sweet, but lightly flavored so you still have a great coffee flavor. They have the order counter and some bar stools in the inside and a few small benches outside to sit. The staff is also really kind and drinks are ready pretty fast even with a long line. Great coffee and chai latte, we are really surprised how good everything tasted. Despite the queue, we were served really quickly. We will recommend the caf to others. I tried a flat white with oat milk. The taste is amazing. The store looks cozy. I like the design of the store.

Saint Pearl,"38 Rue des Saints-Pères, 75007 Paris, France",4.2,48.8549342,2.3305526,"The Eggs Benedict is outstanding  I highly recommend trying it! The cappuccino and cortado are also fantastic. It's a small place, but the staff is very friendly, making it a truly exceptional spot in Paris. I absolutely love it  Arriving with high expectations for brunch, we were delighted by the exceptional quality of the food. I highly recommend savoring the Parisian toast and the pain perdu they truly stand out.
Aptly named, this establishment is undoubtedly a pearl nestled in the heart of Paris. A bit overhyped, arrived during breakfast time on a Saturday, a line quickly built up. They were pretty busy so they tended to try to make people leave right after people finished their food, so everything could feel pretty rushed. Food menu is interesting, pretty average though but not cheap. I would try if you are around the area, but won't necessarily line up a long time for it. Great spot for breakfast and coffee or tea. They have a lot of matcha and Asian flavors infused into breakfast fare. The flavor combos are unusual but delightful.

Timing is everything because its a small space. Your experience will vary a little bit depending on where youre seated, hope not to be seated near the kitchen entry, you will likely be bumped and jostled but the food is worth it. Great coffee, although we had to wait a while now I understand the long wait was due to the amount of coffees to go they have to prepare for their second location, read below

P.S I unfortunately need to change my opinion, based on the service at the other location 4 rue Perronet not indicated on the google maps. The drinks are prepared here and then delivered there, causing them to be served barely lukewarm. The two tables next to ours complained about the same thing. My paper cup tea was served more than half empty, which i think is scandalous considering this is just warm water. The waiter filled it up after request though, but reacted very passive agressively after i brought my half empty cup to the counter. Finally, the same waiter kicked us out later saying they are closing when it was 1530. The cafe closes at 6pm according to google maps, and since we saw other people coming in, this just feels like a good excuse to make us leave. The overall experience is bad, and is a shame since I hoped to enjoy it the second time I came here. This will be the last though ","Monday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Happy Caffé,"214 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France",4.8,48.8646927,2.3296897,"Delicious food for an affordable price in this area. The service was wonderful, as the staff friendly and fun. We dont speak French but they spoke Spanish! Our daughters crepes came with a Colombian flag and a nice message, such cute touches to complement our lunch. Our server also gave our daughter a desert as a gift and she loved it. We all Kraft with our tummies happy and a big smile  Delicious food, good value. Very attentive staff. My crepe even came with a NZ flag after they asked where we were from. We sat outside so it was great for people watching and resting our feet. Definitely recommend. Happy cafe in more ones than one. Great service warmth, care and engagement. Not at all pretentious.
Yummy crepes savoury and sweet plus the cheese cake.
Super location too without the tourist prices.
Highly recommend. It might feel like a tourist trap at first, but the food is delicious! And the service was amazing. Very friendly, would definitly recommend if you are looking to grab a quick snackrest. Honestly, the food here seems a little overrated to me. I don't want to say it was bad, but I simply expected something more. This was just a plain crepe with cheese and tomato. Anyone can make one of these at home for a fraction of the price, even if they have no cooking skills. It doesn't add to the pleasant feeling that the seating areas are very cramped and the staff probably didn't think too much of us, because the food was also served to guests who arrived long after us and before us. I have to admit that the guys who run the business are huge sympathizers, but unfortunately that doesn't make a good business.","Monday: 7:30 AM – 10:30 PM

dear Jane,"58 Rue Sainte-Anne, 75002 Paris, France",4.8,48.86810930000001,2.3364478,"The cafe is cute and small, with not much seating. The cookies are so delicious! I had the matcha cookie and I will definitely get more of them when I get the chance. The cutes little cookie and coffeematcha shop in Paris! Went to this place because of its great google reviews and it did not disappoint. From the cookies to the design to the staff treating us  everything was 1010. Matcha cookies were the best we have ever had, not too sweet, the perfect consistency and prices were reasonable. The staff treating us was extremely nice and even shared some secrets on how they make their cookies. It was just an overall great experience.
The place is quite small and has only two seats inside and two seats outside, however, if you want to sit down and these would be taken, a very cute park is close nearby. And if you are a matcha fan, their sister store Matcha Social Club is just around the corner and offers great matcha but also the cutest matcha merch!

The biggest recommendation for dear Jane! Dear Jane is a quaint little coffee shop here in Paris. The coffee is amazing and the cookies are scrumptious. My favorite cookie is the Matcha. I frequent this place and Im always welcomed by warm and friendly ownersstaff. The only drawback is that the place is so small that it only truly seats 2 people at a time. Therefore, this is more of a takeaway place. Cant recommend this place enough! By the way, these cookies are better than Levain in NYCIYKYK  We bought milk chocolate and matcha white chocolate. The milk chocolate is a bit too sweet but I love their matcha white chocolate cookies. I recommend ! The price is also reasonable compared to other viralhyped cookie places in Paris. Best Cookies in Town! We tried the Pecan Nut Cookie and the Salt Choco Cookie. They were perfect! Huge Chocolate Chunks inside and perfectly soft! 1010 would eat them again I forgot to take pictures because I ate it too fast","Monday: 8:30 AM – 6:30 PM

Selection of the beans epic! 5 stars Francis is very nice and I like the cafe here!! Its a very nice cafe!! Cant wait to come back  Good coffee. Pretentious staff. Overly rigid house rules about the amounts of milk you can or cannot have, whether you can or cannot have foam based on the alleged punditry and expertise in coffee making and testing. Probably impressive for French people who dont know what a good coffee tastes like but the lack of simplicity and the attitude are overshadowing the quality here. Great coffee with oat milk. Beautiful inside with great seats out front. 55 recommend if you are in the area. I have just had the most horrible experience here. There is limited space to sit and was told to sit outside by staff. A woman sitting alone at a table for three said her husband was coming as if this prevented me from drinking my full cup.

Came back the following morning to confirm my previous opinion. Nothing changed. It hits right where it should. Love the professionalism and respect for the coffeemaking process.

I stumbled upon this gem of a coffee shop and discovered the best matcha I've ever tasted! Even as someone who wasn't a matcha fan, this place has completely won me over. The food is consistently healthy and fresh, and the staff's friendliness and welcoming atmosphere make it a joy to visit. I could see myself being a daily regular here. Highly recommended! nice, cozy coffee shop in the 15th. the black sesame cake was a bit too dry for me though  but still tasty. I want to come back to try the scones and the lunch boxes though!! The atmosphere was so good! Tried signature latte and the coffee was tasty. Ordered scone its a bit dry and a bit hard to eat maybe cuz the tableware is not fit for scone
Would come back and try more cake True hidden gemstone of Paris caf. Very small and cosy place, but there is sth very special about this place. The owner is incredibly kind, polite, and gentle. When you enters in it, you even feel the air is softer. Full of positive vibes and refined drinks and desserts selections. You MUST MUST try their black sesame latte with sponge cakes.

The coffee is pretty good, a little bitter but great milk work. The Cortado was 7.8 bit too thick milk and the flat white was a better 8.0. If you are a coffee lover this is your place. Super nice atmosphere. In a cute little square. I had the batch brew it was from Colombia. Really tasty. They also have good food. Really nice coffeeshop in the middle of Pigalle. The terrace is well exposed to the sun, great for summer and sunny days! The service is fast and efficient, plenty of seats and laptops are accepted. I really enjoyed my time there! Their chai latte and hibiscus tea are really tasty.
Definitely will try their other cooffeeshop Back in Black. This place felt like a real spot to hang out. Very busy, people seat hoping to get the best position for people watching. Oat flat white  was smooth Oatly and quite well pulled although not perfect, but I'm being nitpicky.  I would definitely go again. Only one toilet though. Best coffee shop in Paris!!

They actually really care about the blend, the roast, every beans blend is different for almost all the drinks espressomilkice I usually only find these type of dedication to coffee in London or Copenhagen in Europe, so that is amazing!

The pastries are really nice too! Fresh French pastries  The bun is really nice!

Drinks were very reasonable, 10 Euros for a nice red and no entry fee.  I paid 42 for 2 mixed drinks and 2 very good glasses of wine.  Don't forget to tip the lovely servers.  Great service from the lovely ladies serving me and my friends.  I will go back again in a few days for my last night in Paris.  You really get the feeling of being in Paris singing along with people you don't know.  Everyone was having a great time. If you're looking for a few drinks with good live music, close to Notre Dame, this is your place. Fantastic attention from the staff, nice wine and good location. Totally recommendable What a fantastic venue. I thought everywhere in this part of town would be a tourist trap. But... Excellent drinks, wonderful music and a great vibe. I chilled out after a day on my feet with some good wine and excellent service.
I do have to especially call it the amazing Zaira... I wish all bars had a worker like her. She watched the floor like a hawk, making sure everyone drinks were filled and everyone was happy. If I EVER opened a bar in Paris I would want her working there.
Make sure you drop by for some great music and even better service. Prices are fantastic too. was wandering the streets of Paris when it started to rain on us when we stumbled upon this hidden gem! the live pianist was amazing, playing a range of different songs and the drinks were fantastic! we will definitely be back  Hidden gem!

This place was such a hit and I will be returning for more live music. The inside looks dark and moody and fits the vibes of the music. Drinks are a good price, however the only food I saw was a meat and cheese board so thats something to consider.

I walked in asking for an Americano with a side of milk and he said non.  The milk would spoil the flavour and if I wanted milk he suggested a cappuccino.

He was right.

Sometimes it is nice to surrender to the experts!   And that they are in here!

Great atmosphere, with hanging chairs and bright yellow seats and soft French music!

 You walk in and can tell they mean business with their coffee! Quality is great  my macchiato was nutty with hints of chocolate. The staff are very friendly, but the interior although a decent size seemed cramped. Hanging chairs, bar seats and small tables  theres a variety of seating. Worth the visit. Great cafe for a midafternoon break from exploring Paris, with one of the most delicious espressos in the city. Highly recommend the relaxed vibe and chairs suspended from the ceiling, if thats your thing! Excellent coffee. freshly roasted beans. the grand cru in particular was terrific. Pretty small selection of foodbites. The interior feels a lil crammed but nice vibes nonetheless. friendly staff! Okay atmosphere.
Service depends on the person.
Tight spacing. Coffee is very expensive.
Menu is fixed with a we cant change anything attitude. Not even adding a drop of milk in the coffee  come on
Overall, the experience was better at the original small Terre de Caf on rue Rambuteau, which was still expensive back then.
But now, it is a 5 charge for a double expresso and mediocre overall experience.
I wont be preferring this place again, cest dommage.

The staff were very fast and attentive. I had the tasting menu with the wine pairings and every bite was just fantastic! I would recommend to anybody visiting Paris! We wanted to visit this place regardless of the thought that it could be too touristy. We were really delighted that the place lives up to its reputation. The scallops were really well prepared and delicious. The escargots with parsley butter were very tasty and very well cooked. Pleasant and helpful personnel guide you through the many menu service options. Lovely and vibrant setting provides a superb backdrop for an excellent Parisian lunch. I started with a half dozen oysters and turned to the seared tuna for a main course. Most enjoyable way to kick off my holiday in France! Style over substance. Stopped by for lunch and had a croque Madame which looked great though I found it to be both cold and lacked taste. I sent the food back after a bite to which they reheated the food and gave it back. On a positive note the French onion soup was good and hot.

I didnt order food, just dessert and coffee, which were both very delicious and of good quality.
Despite it being extremely crowded, the service was very fast. I enjoyed a pleasant time with my family.
I highly recommend the hot chocolate Its a bit pricy but the food is quite delicious. I love the hot chocolate very creamy and thick, and the bakery is great. Service was also good here in my experience It was our first time there, the breakfast was good. Overall a pleasant time spent there!

We wasn't too familiar with the culture, but they wasn't very patient. But still acceptable I guess. Food a little overpriced too compared to some of the other breakfast places I tried in Paris.

Environment was beautiful. 

Breakfast was good too!

Worth trying once! If you enjoy pastries, cappuccino, crepes, macaroons, a classic Paris cafe feelvibe then run don't walk to Carette!!! During our trip to Paris we ate at two different locations and they were both delicious. We ordered a variety of items and everyone in our family was extremely happy with their meals both times. Not only was the food good, the service was delightful. We didn't feel rushed or neglected, just the right amount of time to order and eat. The atmosphere of the cafe was very classic Paris and had great charm, this for sure was one of our favorite spots in Paris! Visited July 2024 with my teen daughter and nieces who had seen this place all over social media. Hot chocolate and croissants were delicious but a bit overpriced for what they are. Brother in law had the eggs with mushrooms and he loved it. Hubby had a Cappuccino and a side of bacon that was really tasty too. Overall we enjoyed it, service was ok. Guy behind the counter at the bakery could be nicer. Our waitress was nice and efficient. Got vanilla macaroons to go and they were delicious!!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:30 PM

La Rotonde,"105 Bd du Montparnasse, 75006 Paris, France",4.3,48.84236199999999,2.3291618,"La Rotonde is a true gem for anyone who loves classic French cuisine! The tartar beef was wonderfully seasoned, and the steak was cooked to perfection, full of rich flavor. The oysters were fresh and delicious, but the real star of the meal was the snailsthe best Ive ever had, hands down! Each dish was prepared with care and authenticity, making for a memorable dining experience. What truly sets La Rotonde apart, though, is the exceptional service. The staff Morgan was the warmest, treating us with genuine hospitality and making sure we felt welcome and taken care of from start to finish. Their passion for great food and topnotch service truly shines through. I highly recommend La Rotonde for a fantastic meal and unforgettable experience! Very lively, beautiful view of Eiffel Tower, lots of seating inside and out. Food was very good and prices were reasonable.

Service was great.

Lovely experience!

I was a bit tired of French cuisine and they had delicious Pad Thai! We were recommended to this place for dinner and had a lovely time . We went at a time when it was very busy 8p so be prepared to wait a little in between orders if you go there between 730p to 830p. However, the staff is very nice and will work with any dietary restrictions you may have. Overall, it's a great place for dinner and whenever we're in Paris, we will dine here again . What a beautiful restaurant. Loved it !
The food, the service and the environment, everything was perfect. The manager gave us an amazing table next to the window, even though we didnt book one. Bathroom was clean too.
I would definitely be coming back one day. Great dinner spot. Cozy and romantic. Excellent French traditional food. Service was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful.","Monday: 7:30 AM – 12:00 AM

The sesame latte was good but not exceptional. Personnel is really nice! Come by if you are nearby, I recommend Amazing fruity food options with great service and atmosphere. Way better and way cheaper than nearby mainstream options. A must go if you stay nearby. It is a very cosy place. The cakes and cookies are homemade. I ordered the carrot bento cake which was delicious I believe it cost 5 as well as a cinnamon cookie Id recommend anyone try it and a sweet potato latte. It cost me 16,40 and I will definitely go  there again ! Cozy little tea  salon in the 15th arrondissement of paris.

Ordered
10  Bingsu Th Vert sweet shaved ice and matcha powder sprinkled over it topped with sweet red beans, whipped cream and a cut in two mochi placed ok each sides.

Wifi, not for  work space  on weekends, fun upside down decorations look up, gives it a little Alice in wonderland vibe. The injeolmi bingsu is the perfect eat for a hot summer day.

Finely shaved ice, topped with soybean powder, sweet condensed milk, red bean, icecream, mochi and usually bungeoppangtaiyaki which was outofstock when I went.

Its a big serving, like a meal for one, but really made to be shared by two.

The cafe is small, and cozy. Theres WiFi available, so its a great spot to work from as well.","Monday: 12:00 – 7:00 PM

The atmosphere and service were not bad.  Just to go for experiencing the coffee time in France. So many people lined up, waited for around 10 mins. Great choice for a casual dinner in Montpasse. Generous cocktail pours and classic French bistro food. Solid preparation. Attentive service. Good atmosphere with lots of terrace dining. Cute caf in the 6th with a nice terrace. Sunday brunch is pretty good, offering several combos or  la carte options.

Big downside is the quality of service. Staff are overwhelmed and very inefficient. Enjoyed some very tasty French onion soup, Poke bowls, and seafood pasta. The restaurant is very cosy with an open air garden which is very enjoyable in summer. Very good french onion soup, cheese and meat plater were also delicious. It's a lovely atmosphere to relax and eat. Our waiter Clement was very helpful as well, especially since our French isn't that great.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 2:00 AM

Café d’Auteur « Specialty Coffee Paris »,"39 Rue Mazarine, 75006 Paris, France",4.7,48.854221,2.338259,"Very expensive, but at the same time extremely delicious coffee! There was a large selection of coffee beans with their detailed descriptions. The most expensive one went up to 20 for an espresso, which seems a little crazy to me. But we settled for coffee at a quarter of the price and were very satisfied. Actually, I have to say, I don't think I've had better coffee in Paris. The attention in the form of a small cinnamon cookie will also please. So this place is for real coffee lovers, but definitely worth it! Great place  and great coffee with lots of variations and blends. Lovely place to sit aswell and the staff were lovely. The only downfall is the prices like very expensive and even the basic ones weren't cheap. Cafe d'Auteur specialises in all sorts of specialty coffee and is a mustgo for coffee lovers in Paris! The variety of coffee types is endless, from espresso, Americano, syphon, cappucino, viennois, Cafe du'Auteur provides you also with a wide range of roasting and beans.

You basically pay based on the origin of the coffee and the type. Even very rare coffee from Ethopia, Jamaica, and Indonesia kopi luwak is being served, which makes this coffee shop quite unique.

We loved the coffee of the day and Colombian cappucino! The flavours were extraordinary and of very good quality. Highly recommended specialty coffee shop in Paris! The coffee origin selection is outstanding and you can have it made by your method of choice. Service was impeccable very friendly and welcoming. A nice conversation to go with your Parisian breakfast is always a plus Very good place. Top beans but some of them just rare and thus pricy but not necessarily tasty. Good machinery. They roast the beans by themselves. The barrister quality was ok and not overwhelming... But still all top for a good coffee.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM

They also have some interesting chocolate bars for sale. I bought the praline one and it tastes like good chocolate.
The staff was kind and spoke English rather well.
They have an area for anyone who wants to work on a computer. Super fast wifi and a few sockets makes for a great place to have a quick meeting or do some work. The host is very friendly and helpful. No ambient music when I was there which I prefer, but if it's full I think it can get pretty loud. Again, the wifi was the highlight. I got a very stable connection of 70mbps updown with 4 people in the cafe. What an amazing gem for coffee and cake lovers! Such warm treatment and excellent coffee. The iced latte is a must in this Paris summer and there's a choice of milks almond, oat etc. Really friendly people and great expertise on coffee. We will be back as soon as we can! We were looking for a place to sit and have coffee in the afternoon and stumbled across this cozy intimate place. We had a decaf cappuccino and a 2shot Americano along with a slice of pistachioapricot pie. It was delicious. The service was attentive and welcoming. Definitely a come back to place. Delicious coffee and delicious, rich, hot chocolate . This little spot is perfect if you want to get some work done there's a counter which often has people sitting at it with their laptops or if you want to grab a takeaway coffee and walk through Luxembourg gardens.  But I travel here just for their coffee. I usually order a latte or cappuccino ","Monday: Closed

The infusion drinks are also done with quality ingredients. Everyone there is knowledgeable about coffee and willing to share. It was a great experience for us.

Go in with an open mind and you will be surprised What a great find! Felt like we were having coffee on the plaza of a small French village in the middle of Paris!

Coffee was great, staff super friendly. Would just say that the V60 filter was a bit small compared to other coffee shops.

Highly recommended. omg, very kind and nice stuff and the most delicious coffee in the city, 1010 Very good coffee. And iced latte. You can tell they are passionate about their coffee.

They have some tables outside in the shade  perfect for a hot summer day.

Unfortunately they don't have decaf coffee. The cookie has a nice texture but was a bit too sweet for me. This is beautiful cozy coffee. The coffee was great and the atmosphere makes magic. The only downside is that there were none food options when weve been there.
Beware that computers and workers are not allowed. Theres no WiFi. I kind of liked that.

Grand Café Tortoni,"45 Rue de Saintonge, 75003 Paris, France",4.5,48.86304310000001,2.3639147,"Go for the decor, bar stools and experience. Stay to have a Madeleine and smell their scents. I have to agree with another reviewer, I've had better tasting coffee elsewhere.

The bar stools are super comfortable, even for a bigger hipped lady like myself. There are purse hooks too.

After my snack, I took in the scents and purchased a wonderful body oil and the orange toothpaste  most I've spent on toothpaste thus far. It's a delightful experience to sit down and enjoy a coffee and some pastries. The place is beautiful, and the staff is super friendly. On the other hand, the coffee is not the best, but not everything has to be specialty coffee. Additionally, you can purchase highquality combs, perfumes, and other items that are perfect for yourself or as a gift. One thing that you definitely must have in Paris. Scents  sensations, this cafe romances you from the moment you walk through the doors.
Old world charms and corners filled with stories, you feel transported and all of a sudden very in the moment at the same time.
It may just be one of my most favourite cafes in the world.
The coffee is sensational, the presentation is flawless and to have Buly scents be a part of the experience provides the perfect compliment.
Just go already!!!! This place is a true gem! Vintage classic atmosphere and so unique. The moment youll enter the space youll be blown away by all the amazing scents.

Unfortunately we didnt have the opportunity to have a coffee. Keep in mind barista goes out for lunch brake between 12301330. However we bought a couple of things!

All items are exceptional. The scents divine and the quality seems to be high as well.

I sprayed myself with the perfumes around 1230 its 2115 now and I still smell them. Especially the oud one.

Keep in mind that perfumes scent keeps transforming as time goes by. I am thinking of going back to get one more perfume the Oud one.
At the beginning was very intense even for me who I love Oud, but now it has transformed into this irresistible sweet mystical Oud saffron  woody scent. My favorite hot chocolate in Paris.
Yes, its a bit expensive but here you are getting very high quality and the experience and ambiance is worth it.
Great style.

Le Café Marly,"93 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France",3.7,48.86166890000001,2.3359927,"Le Cafe Marly, located right in front of the Louvre Museum, offers an iconic and breathtaking view of the Louvre pyramids. The setting is simply amazing and adds a unique charm to the dining experience.
We visited for breakfast and were delighted with our choices. The pastries and toast with butter and jam were delicious, and the coffee latte was perfectly brewed. The quality of the food, combined with the stunning view, made for a memorable morning in Paris. Highly recommend to book in advance! Nice food well presented and the service is definitely five stars for Paris. Very friendly staff that brought me new breads because mine was not warm enough. I found very nice from them. I found a bit overpriced the menu but you just pay because of the view the Louvre so is understandable why is a bit overpriced. Highly recommend this place if you are in this area. Really lovely views and great hospitality. The door staff was lovely and really beautiful and although I wished the champagne was colder it was still good.  we had the steak and the Tom yum Cod.

Gerard was lovely. Spectacular atmosphere. Magical views of the Louvre inside and out as always! Food has really declined since the many times Ive dined here in the past and the staff were tremendously unprofessional. Suggestions were awful. Bottle of Wine was brought to the table after the mains have already arrived. And when we inquired  it was as if it was a surprise. I would have much preferred to enjoy a glass before starting our meals like a proper French restaurant. The only real reason to eat here is because of the views after all. To top things off  they demanded a tip.  If youre going to demand American style tipping  you should as such be prepared for American style expectations of service and smile a bit more. Beggars cant be choosers as they say.

Also suggest to have a look at the wine list in my photos. I had breakfast at Le Caf Marly before visiting the Louvre Museum. I ordered a caf latte with a croissant. To be honest, the food and drinks were pretty averagenothing particularly special.

What really makes this place stand out is the view. While eating or drinking, you get an amazing view of the Louvre, which adds to the experience.

However, the prices are quite high compared to other spots in the area. For the photos I took, it was worth it, but overall, its more about the location than the food.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 2:00 AM

Angelina Paris Musée du Louvre,"Pl. du Carrousel, 75001 Paris, France",3.8,48.8617341,2.3362121,"We came here for afternoon snack. We had no idea about the fame of this brand but ended up trying out their famous hot chocolate. I have to admit that if you have sweet tooth then you will love this place. But for me the hot chocolate was way too sweet and I could not finish it. Other items we ordered were also too sweet and the onion soup was too salty. It seemed their menu items were all on the extreme ends of the spectrum.

Overall it is not a place I would order sweet or savory items again. BUT, their terrace seats had a fantastic view of the plaza in front of the museum and that photo opportunity alone is enough for me to revisit. The best cafe in the museum . Do visit and try to catch a table in the front view. Its amazing. Egg avocado was awesome and the millefeuille was delicious. Take photos of plates with the pyramid  We got to Angelinas around 930 and there was no queue.  Service was really slow today.  It took nearly two hours for Le Brunch.  After clearing table from Eggs Benedict it took twenty to thirty minutes for French Toast to come.  It took a similar amount of time for paying the bill.  Food was good though a bit too sweat by the end.  We asked for water with the French Toast to help with the sugar, but we never received it.  We left half asleep.

It was our second time here in as many years, but probably will not return due to the slow service. My experience at restaurant Angelina Louvre in Paris was thoroughly disappointing. After visiting the exhibition, my party and I decided to have lunch there. I ordered a homemade lemonade, but to my surprise, it turned out to be just lemon squeezed into water, without any added flavor.

For food, I opted for the quiche and ravioli, but both dishes lacked any taste whatsoever. The quiche was bland, and the ravioli was flavorless and devoid of any seasoning.

Although the view of the Louvre Pyramid was stunning, I can't say the same about the food. In summary, you shouldn't come here for the food experience. Nice location and the chocolate cake that I ate was delicious. I never write bad reviews but the iced chocolate was so disgusting. It was warm, had no ice or ice cream in it and just had a really foul taste? I really dont know how someone could stuff up an iced chocolate, but they did. Perhaps the milk was off? I read reviews about their hot chocolate being delicious, so was thinking the iced one would be too!  I went later in the afternoon when the massive line was gone. Was asked if I wanted to leave a tip, but I did not as the expensive iced chocolate was undrinkable and I had to wait for a long time sitting there holding my credit card to be noticed to pay and leave. They did not ask why I had not consumed the drink and I just wanted to get out of there.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 4:45 PM

Good coffee and the staff were really helpful and friendly.  My favorite cafe in all of Paris! Everything from their self made coffee and chocolate to the beautiful atmosphere! Love love love Coffee was good, as it should be at this price. Had a very mediocre cookie, no madeleines were available. Only one staff member was on, who was really friendly, but had an impossible job to do taking all the orders, making coffee and apparently also responsible for baking the madeleines, so it took ages to get our coffee. The toilet was blocked, obviously the one staff member wasn't able to do anything about it. Also disappointed to read Alain is a tax dodger! Is a roasting coffee shop, where smells like coffee, has various types of beans for your espresso, very good taste. Interior is inviting and seems bigger, but has only 3 tables inside, but is enough, chairs from lether and comfortable. Good coffee machine, personalized, and various grinders. Very professional. Why is so hard in Paris to get a good coffee? This place is ideal. Thank you for nice service and suggestions. Also you may buy coffee and various products.

Although the Turkish eggs were tasty, the dish was served called. My partner said the same about his Egg Benedict. The coffee was okay. Sadly, I got the impression that they dont really try or care which is a real shame. I got the iced latte and my friend got the yuzu lemonade. My latte was okay, nothing special. And the lemonade was a bit too sweet for her liking. We had to wait in a really long line to order, but overall service was friendly and super fast. Im ordered the pancakes and its burn!! I already cut a bit on 1 of the 3 pancakes that has been served. And then i saw the burn part and i ask em to change it.

Then they took it and replaced it with the 23 pancakes from before becau its cold. And just replace to top one which I already cut to a new one which is also burn. I cant imagine how come this fancy cafe serve that kind of food and the taste is below the standard.

Its too pricy for that cheap taste food. DONT EVER TRUST TIKTOK The ambienceatmosphere of the restaurant is nice with pleasant street views. However the place is very over priced. On the same block there are several other places that are way cheaper with significantly better food e.g., Bohemian, etc.

I had the kombucha 7EURO, overpriced and the bagel with salmon, cream cheese, capers, onion, and dill. The bread it was served on was not toasted and was a bit staleold tasting and also over priced compared to other places where you would get the same dish.

The staff are very polite and helpful. We had two dishes and some coffee and matcha. The dishes were average. The scrambled eggs were a bit early off the stove and a bit liquid. The Turkish eggs were nice but low in flavour. It felt as if something was missing. I saw some guy eating avocado toast and thought it might have been a better choice","Monday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Fringe contact me to solve my misunderstanding, they attach great importance to the problem of the guests, try to clarify and deal with it, very thankful.

I order a cappuccino, americano and a cinnamon roll there. The coffee is okay and the vibes is good. With some problem there cinnamon roll is sold out so i didn't get it. Also the toilet can't use. When i leave the shop and check with my consumption record, they charge the price not the menu's price. I was confused. Overall, my experience was not good. Best coffee I've had in Paris. Service was kind and gentle. Highly recommend.  Oh, and the pastries were still warm mmmmm delicious. Really cosy spot to meet up with friends or to chill alone reading your book as I did! Strong competitor for the best cinnamon bun Ive tasted in Paris so far! Really delicious and excellent comforting chai latte. The girl who served me was super sweet as well!

Try the fresh seafood platter with raw oysters. This is one of Paris most authentic restaurants of course a little touristy but perfect to get the full on experience. The escargots were amazing, same as the steak and frites. Good atmosphere, beautiful decor and very relaxed setting!
Thumbs up! Our service was perfect and the meal was absolutely delicious. I had sea bass and my daughter had salmon tartar. The Parisian Onion Soup was likely the best Ive ever had. My daughter experienced her first ever escargot here and she admitted she loved the flavor it had an earthiness that was brought out by the herbs, garlic, and butter. For dessert my daughter ordered crepes flamb and she was able to watch as our server prepared it which delighted her. Thank you so much for the experience and we look forward to dining with you again in October. The food is excellent especially the seafood. The service is great and friendly!

It is such a pity to produce so bad coffee with a decent machine. Far too hot, bad foam and on top served in a plastic cup. We left without drinking it. Please get a barista training or watch some YouTube videos at least. Cannot recommend enough. If you are within a 40,000 minute metro ride, consider stopping by. You wont be disappointed, but you will have a reoccurring metro bill problem. The Gent knew our order by the second day 

so kind This is the second time I stopped by this caf and I'd recommend it highly. Very friendly staff and excellent coffee and lattes. Very welcoming and I was able to sit and read a bit while waiting for my partner. Came here for an afternoon drink and snack with my family. The cinnamon croissant was good and had a nice texture. However, the drink was not great and the atmosphere was cramped with bad music playing, unfortunately. Idk where this high rating came from. The cappuccino had way too much milk, and the milk tasted bitter. The presentation could be better, Also clean up the place a bit.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 5:30 PM

Loved sitting outside people watching. Cafe de Paris has good vibes and nice service. I love the food thereits flavorful and delicious. Best place for a simple breakfast or evening home made fries with a bottle of chardonney. Great service despite lots of people. Feels good when you're there. Great dinner, didnt take enough photos of this place. Service was awesome, snails and duck were very tasty. Beer was good too.
Would recommend eating here to experience local Parisienne food on a street that has an amazing vibe at night, weekends are much busier but during the week is still a great experience.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 2:00 AM

We taste coffee all over the world
We had 1 flat white and 1 cappuccino
Good balance between espresso. I would have preferred a bit stronger espresso but this is a VERY good cappuccino Great cafe that was opened from 8am. And it's right across from Amelie's apartment which is very cool. Also they offered milk alternatives and that is not that usual in Paris. Excellent cappuccino, and fresh pastries toasted on the spot, as if they were freshly baked

Super friendly baristas

Adorable little quite quaint sitting room, natural light, mellow ambient music at a very low volume

Clean bathroom

..and most important AIR CONDITIONING!! 5stars

Must visit on your way to Montmartre. More like a 4.5 out of 5.
Espresso is very strong, not watered down like most other places. The deco and atmosphere is great. The only drawback is the coffee has a bit sour taste and I wish they have a dark roast choice. For the price this is great! We had cookies and they are amazing dipped but the drinks were a bit weak for my liking anyways. The store is amazing vibes and I could see myself coming here regularly.

ONI Coffee Shop,"10 Bd Saint-Martin, 75010 Paris, France",4.5,48.86881670000001,2.3577134,"The food was not worth the money. I ordered a brunch package include Focaccia and coffee. The focaccia and the egg was cold. The vegetables were not fresh and regarding to the portion is not worth the price for 13. The waitress politely asked me to leave because it turns out that the cafe is not available for working space from 1300 even if purchased more snacks which also not worth the price, in my opinion. I would say its a weird regulation. The only good about the cafe was a good hygiene with the sanitation, friendly staff, and the vibe. The coffee was standard Lovely little coffee shop with a nice menu for breakfsst brunch. The people here are kind and helpful.

Food was delicious and coffee very nice.

One downside is no laptops weekends all day and weekdays after 1300, if you are looking for a place to sit and work for a while then. I went there with my girlfriend for brunch on a Sunday a few weeks ago and we spontaneously got a seat. The service was very good and the atmosphere was great. We enjoyed the dishes and the price was worth it. Very good coffee. We will be back definitely! Very pleasant and nice place to stay for a good cup of coffee and delicious meal. The service was extremely nice, food was delicious and fresh. Definitely recommend this place to enjoy your time here when you are nearby. Excellent coffee shop and brunchlunch spot with a weekly menu, that incorporates fresh seasonal produce. The food is pleasant to the pallate and lovely to the eye, the drinks are refreshing, the coffee is carefully selected and lovingly brewed, and the ambience is calm, warm and very plasant.

Café Kitsuné Tuileries,"208 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France",4.2,48.8644663,2.3303945,"What a cute, beautiful cafe in heart of Paris, with exceptional service and kind staff. The cafe is airy, clean and welcoming. So many non dairy options and coffees I have ordered were perfect. Staff was welcoming and kind from beginning to the end. Their matcha was lovely, but nothing special. The smell of the coffee intrigued me and I'm hitting myself on the head for not getting one of their coffee drinks instead! I will definitely go try one at their NYC location. I could have given a better review if staff was a bit more attentive. Our order was ready on the counter for unknown period of time and we were not notified. Coffee I ordered was not as good as I expected and on top of that it had cooled down to the time I decided to go and check if my order is ready. Ive tried sandwich with poached egg which in my case was cooked fully and not poached. Good coffee served with a smile. The flat white coffee could have been a bit stronger in our opinion. It tasted like a latte macchiato. It's still good, but there is room for improvement. I do not understand the hype of this place. The coffee is good but not amazing. Also would be nice if they had something on their page about the coffee shop not being laptop friendly. Didn't know until I arrived and was looking for somewhere to work remote for a couple of hours.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Staff were friendly albeit sometimes a bit difficult to get a hold of or would take a bit long to come back with what you had asked for.

Super close to the Louvre and is a good option if you dont want to have fast food or anything chainlike in the area. The staff couldnt have been better! They were attentive and lively! The food was good, I had the steak with an egg on it and fries with a side salad, everything was very delicious.

The location is ideal if you are visiting the Louvre museum!! amazing place! delicious, guys are very attentive, friendly, courteous. food is amazing! cappuccino at the end, mind blowing highly recommend, the owner is just great! The fries were good but thats about it. Good to stop for a drink after the Louvre but really better to save your calories for elsewhere. I'm pretty sure this is a tourist trap. This place reminded me to always read the reviews before going to a restaurant. It took 30 minutes for them to take our order, and another 2030 minutes to actually receive our food, which was actually not as bad as I thought it'd be.

JOZI BRUNCH Pantheon,"3 Rue Valette, 75005 Paris, France",4.7,48.8478702,2.3471071,"We've found this small Cafe not far from where we were staying in Paris in the Latin quarter. We've been there twice and both occasions the food was delicious and the coffee was arguably one of the best we had in Paris. Service on the other hand is on the slow side may be due to the number of staff servicing the tables, once the order was taken food and drinks were served pretty quickly. I'd definitely recommend it and go there myself again. Had a lovely meal and all in our group were happy with their food. The avocado toast with egg was great.

Charming spot, and very friendly staff. I did my best to try and order in French, and they were very patient with me and helpful.

Keep up the great work! I loved loved loved this place.  They had excellent high quality coffee, as good as a good Melbourne cafe, and prices were fair and every single staff member was friendly and positive.  They even laughed in a good way at my attempts to joke in French.  I tried lots of places but went back here multiple times as my goto when i was staying in the area.  Thankyou Jozi for making such a lovely welcoming place. We had the Brunch and it was simply amazing. Everything fresh and tasty, great coffee.  Recommend 100 Great place by Panthen to grab brunch. We had the brunch menu and the ham and cheese croissant. Everything tasted awesome and the staff were very pleasant. Not much space to sit and the place seems popular so get in early so you snag a space. One correction needs to be said that even though they open at 8am they start serving the brunch service at 9am. Before 9am you can only order to go coffee and pastries.
Other than that recommend this place to get food before coming on Panthen visit.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 4:30 PM

Picture if you have watched Amelie !

Waiters are very nice but I didnt really enjoy my meal

However the place is very fun and the service
Is excellent

Didnt like they staff asked for a tip Without giving me the change of adding this myself which probably would have been a
Bigger amount as
I was about to leave cash as a tip  but  when they come with the ticket and grab the machine and say how much with the tip it kind of
Broke the magic of the moment and left me thinking that was a bit cheeky  however they make you feel very welcome and are very nice people I read a bunch of the previous reviews, and still had to come to Caf des Deux Moulins to honor the teenage version of myself who adored ""Amelie."" Maybe the reviewers we're having a bad day or maybe the staff was having a bad day... But I had a wonderful experience. The staff and I interacted with several staff members were all lovely. Our server in particular was very kind, charming and also very stylish. She was attentive and did her best to accommodate a couple of Americans. I ordered the onion soup and the small Parisian salad. I thought they were both great. The baguette that came with the soup was good. I think baguettes have to be good if they are madesold in Paris. Anyway, I was very pleased with what I ordered. My husband ordered the cheeseburger. He said the burger was decent but nothing to write home about and he was very pleased with the fries. We shared Amelie's Crme Brle  and I thought it was fabulous. If it wasn't socially unacceptable, I would have licked the ramekin clean. It was trs bon! I loved the cute aesthetic of the cafe and how they feature Amelie all over the cafe from photos to the menu. I loved it! If you're a fan of the film, it's definitely worth checking out! Heres a touristic stop. If you are into the Amelie movie, you should stop by.
We ordered her menu and unfortunately the dishes came in a little bit cold. Not the best choice for having lunch, the hamburguers ordered beside my table looked good though Toilet was dirty.

No olive o served in the table. We only took a 5 euro coffee to check the interior since we wanted to see how similar the place looks compared to the movie Amelie. It looks a bit different than in the movie but a lot of what was in the movie is still there. The service was surprisingly pleasant. There were just 2 guys working plus kitchen staff, and they seemed a bit overwhelmed but in very high and positive spirits. I had read some bad reviews about the service here so I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't the case when we visited. If you love the movie Amelie, you must stop here for a coffee and soak in the atmosphere of Montmartre. The staff are so lovely, and the service was prompt. We recommend the croque madame and croque monsieur! As Amlie says, ""We pass the time of day to forget how time passes."" This is the perfect place to do just that.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 2:00 AM

Staff was very kind, they offer some cute merch at the cafe too! The cafe has selfservice  Cappuccino was very delicious! 1010! Loved the foam! Many cool people here! 
I would definitely recommend this place!! Very cool coffee place, great for a quick meeting, lovely deserts and amazing blends and roasts. Dont expect to shelter yourself from the cold in the winter . The sitting inside is almost non exhistant.
The terasse must be amazing in the summer .

I just went there because of a colleague this lunch, the staff is prompt and quick. The quality of the product is great. My coffee was perfectly balanced. I took a cappuccino  and a carrot cake today.

Ill definitely go back to try their other desert one day.

Anyone passing by les Halles that is a great coffee shop.

I loved the ambiance and the sticker they sell for 1 euro. This is the BEST cafe I have ever been to in my life, and I have been to a lot. I reside in NYC but when I find myself in Paris, Motors is a must. The staff are some of the nicest people I have met. They take time out of their duties I know they are very busy to come check on you and see if you are liking your coffee. No other cafe I have been to does that. The coffee options are some of the best you can find, from friedhats, to special guests and beyond, you can be sure that each bean is dialed into perfection. The prices are perfect! Remember you are paying for the coffee bean, which a lot of work goes into, NOT just the drink. The aesthetic is truly something else. I wear their tshirt every day!  One of the best coffee shops I have been to in Paris. Try each and every coffee especially the handmaid ones. And the cinnamon roll is awesome! You have an area at the front to enjoy your coffee outside. Amazing and pretty unique specialty coffee, with several sweet bites that are absolutely delicious.

The coffee in this place actually made me feel different tastes than usual, worth stopping by!","Monday: 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM

This appears to be a local spot, as we seemed to be the only tourist at lunch, which is a great sign. We had the Parisienne burger, the croque monsieur, and a bottle of white wine. The burger was the best Ive eaten in a long time. Somehow the delicious sauted onions stole the show, but the cheese and bacon were great as well.

Coutume,"47 Rue de Babylone, 75007 Paris, France",4.3,48.851643,2.318316,"I feel the need to leave a review given all of the recent, poor reviews. Not only was the food delicious but the service was friendly and very good! We are so glad we came! We got the Brioche French Toast, two fried eggs, bacon, black coffee, and a flat white. Everything was wonderful. Dont let the other reviews stop you from visiting this spot!

Also, if you are visiting with children, its worth noting that their bathroom has both a changing table and a training toilet seat making this spot unusually welcoming to kids! I want to write to sincerely show my gratitude of my experience at Coutume. I had a really exhausted morning but the food and hospitality here really cured me. The staff was really kind. My dinning experience was amazing. And thx again for making my day  had one of my best coffee here A little cafe gem in Paris, particularly if you're after an Aussie brunchlatte style vibe. Coffee hits the spot go double shot if you want a stronger coffee flavour and the menu is broad enough to cater to your preferences.

Unfortunately I experienced a minor letdown in the service for a simple order and those next to me didn't receive 1 of their 3 items, but I suspect this was a oneoff circumstance that occurred during the Paralympic Games and not reflective of the everyday experience. Nice place to have lunchbrunch. Prices are a bit high for my taste. I ordered a Caesar salad which was a bit dry but overall very nice. Service was great and I had an enjoyable visit.  It did look like other dishes people around me ordered were amazing, so I'm hoping to come  back and enjoy more! Thank you! I checked it out on Google before going to the market and visited it.

The best bagel I've ever had in my life. The ingredients were the freshest I've had and they all combined into the perfect bite every time.

Shodai Matcha,"7 Rue Volta, 75003 Paris, France",4.6,48.864899,2.356821399999999,"This place is pretty famous. Known them since they were just having 1 restaurant and now there are 2 more branches! Meaning they did a good job! Durian crepes were the best for those who love it, matcha is a bit bitter than the Japanese tea salon. Well, others have different preferences. The ambiance was great but crowded, which is normal theyre famous!. Definitely a good one. Today went to opera branch, less crowded than this one Get the Mango thousand layer cake !!!!
It was SO GOOD. Prices are about 8 per dessert and about 7 per drink. It's a very cute and cozy place, definitely check it out if you like great bubble tea and matcha desserts. This is a really cute place with a lot of Matcha based options. We tried the popular Matcha cake with nuts on top, but we ended up removing the nuts because it was better without it. The tea with taro was okay. I would say overall, it is quite pricey for what it offers but could be a good experience Very delicious place to eat at but it is TOO CROWDED.

 The wait line was the most atrocious I had for a dinein place  it was a Sunday afternoon and we waited over an hour ! I understand the hype and it does taste delicious but I probably will only go there for takeout from now on. We were tired and miserable by the time we entered and it really impacted our overall experience.

Food wise  delicious. The ingredients taste raw and fresh, we took a sesame rolls and it tasted just like the one I had in Japan. The matcha was very good too. However they didn't have any of the new menu items advertised on the storefront.

 I observed a bad management of the table service inside. We were told that some tables were available but a lot of people inside refused to go, not ordering anything for hours. I went to other dessert places that were in high demand but I never waited that long. I believe you should be more strict as a waiter and make sure everyone in line gets to enjoy your desserts. I had the Yuzu miel smoothie float, and the taste was pretty good and refreshing. I was caught off guard though when they didn't accept card for under 10 euros. The staff also told me I could only sit in the store and drink if there is not so many people. Not sure if there is a policy for that? I also paid for my drink, so I think I should be allowed to sit in the store to enjoy it?","Monday: 12:00 – 10:30 PM

Ladurée,"75 Av. des Champs-Élysées, 75008 Paris, France",4.2,48.870839,2.30319,"Did get to visit on my last trip, so I made it a point to visit on this trip. So happy I did. The entire vibe of the restaurant was wonderful. We had a leisure breakfast before we went shopping and it was so relaxing. Everything was delicious and I enjoyed my macaroons purchased here throughout my entire trip. The  service was great and not once did we feel rushed. Everything was clean and our server was attentive and kind. Will definitely be back! So this is how I think of this place Its a museum filled with fun colorful things. And you paying for the museum fee by paying for an extremely high price for the menu. The prices for food and drinks are extremely expensive, but what you get in exchange is to appreciate the ridiculously cute decor, and a chance to taste the original Paris macrons. In other words, it is a tourist trap. However, if you can afford it, it is still fun. There are some exceptionally delicious tea and the macrons are indeed out of this world. Theres also a shop area where you can purchase additional gifts and takeaway menu. It is worth trying once as a tourist, but I wouldnt go back again. We went during the Grand brunch on Sunday and everything was delicious! The options were endless and I had the best French toast Ive ever had. The service was also topnotch. Highly recommend brunch at Laduree! Beautifully decorated restaurant at one of the most expensive streets in the world to be. They offer everything from coffee, pastry, dinning and of course colorful macaroons. The burst of colors would just make you try everything, but the cost would make budgetconscious travelers think twice.

I am not a macaroon aficionado so I couldn't tell the difference from other macaroons I tried. Not twice as good for twice the price. There are flavors only available at this store and I enjoyed them.

If pictures is all you want you could go around the restaurant and caf without purchase. Although when in Paris?  What a beautiful and perfect place, it looks magical, very cute. We love getting to know the place.

We had already eaten macarrons in other places but never in France. The price is a little expensive, but it was worth it, its very good, we got the box with 6 different flavors, and they were all wonderful.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 9:30 PM

The cream is so airy and not too sweet. The fruit is not the best quality thats why the rating is 4 stars. I love, love, love this place! It's a big mustvisit for all matchafans. The staff was very friendly and the food was tasty as hell.  The sesame cookie is really amazing! The best matcha eclairs Ive ever had. Ever. And I try matcha things all day erry day errywhere. This is a must visit spot whenever Im back in Paris. Delicious JapaneseFrench ptisseries at affordable prices. Buns were to die for!! We got the melon pain could eat this everyday, red bean beignet the dough was heavenly and red bean paste was not too sweet, red bean mochi bun super yum!!

Also tried the salmon and okaka bonito flakes onigiris which were good!

Stohrer,"51 Rue Montorgueil, 75002 Paris, France",4.4,48.8652644,2.3468149,"I went there late afternoon and even though the pastry selection was limited I picked up a pain aux raisin which was beyond delicious. Crunchy exterior and soft, fluffy inside. The chocolates were also great recommend the caramel. Lovely service, cheap and affordable and lovely area to walk around. Perfect Insta spot! All of the baked goods would not have looked out of place in a food magazine. The flavours though were not as stimulating as the aesthetics. Don't get me wrong, the pastries taste perfectly fine but they don't thrill your taste buds as much as they exhilarate your eyes. Except the chocolate eclair, that was way too bitter! I was recommended to visit this Patisserie, it was my first stop when I arrived in Paris and I was not disappointed! It's visually Beautiful and the Macaroons and Pastries are amazing, if you visit Paris you must visit Stohrer! This is a well known spot that I'm not sure deserves its popularity or maybe that was its downfall. It was OK but in Paris I'd recommend just grabbing a croissant from anywhere, it's probably better than back home. The one here was either on par or lesser than any other I had. Their vanilla flan is one of the best Ive had and it is a very generous slice for 4.20! Baba au rhum also was excellent, very strong on the rum so even the individual portion is definitely good for sharing.
Also bought a coffee macaron and it was simple but delicious. Definitely an institution worth visiting and if youre lucky, they have some free samples of chocolate by the cashier which are sooo delicious!","Monday: 8:00 AM – 8:30 PM

Pâtisserie Carl Marletti,"51 Rue Censier, 75005 Paris, France",4.6,48.8393696,2.3504509,"I dont want to tell anyone about this bakery and would prefer to keep it my hidden gem. I came in to purchase one dessert for myself and after devouring it, I went back to pick up other treats for my family! Half of their stock was already gone within that time.

If you arent a fan of something too sugary, the chantilly nougatine is a must try. Its very light but the flavours are so well balanced. The cream on top is refreshing and its my new favourite dessert.

They packaged the desserts very well and they came out of the box without a scratch after being in subways and a busy bus. The associates were very kind and even packaged one of my desserts separately so it wouldnt tumble on the others. Cant wait to return!

The only con I can see for others is the price point. For the box I purchased 5 items was around 44 euros. On the last day in Paris, I found a shop coincidentally which offers macarons. It tastes quite good! And feel warm to see owners smile  Incredibly delicious and beautiful pastries. And staff handles them as if they are jewels. At about 8 euros each, they are expensive, but all that deliciousness and beauty is worth it. I liked the chocolate eclair and the cake with purple glass on top. The chocolate cake was not special, I wanted the milfeuille but was not available. We were experiencing serendipity to get to this place being pastry lover. We were in the area and attracted to buy pastries from Carl Marletti  because of the long queue. My favourite is the BelleHelene tart. OMG! It might be the best pastry I have tried in my life. Such a complexity of flavours the chocolate almond cream and poached pear create amazingly tasty contrast in fruity and sweet tastes. We tried the Feather that was also great and the caramel eclair. They didn't had everything because it was December 31st. But it worth going back to Paris to enjoy these amazing original pastries. I will get huge box of pastries next time! If you are visiting Paris definitely worth going here. Thank you for providing such a great pleasure!","Monday: Closed

L’Éclair de génie,"14 Rue Pavée, 75004 Paris, France",3.9,48.8561874,2.3607075,"A place with lovely eclairs and chocolates. Each eclair is so beautiful, although the prices are more expensive than other patisseries.

The staff are very friendly and helped with ensuring the products I bought suited my allergies.

It's a lovely indoor space, but I wish we could have eaten at the shop rather than only have take out options. The store is like a dessert boutique with all the clairs beautifully presented.

Both the clair de pistache pistachio and the clair de vanille vanilla were delicious.

The choux pastry was light and airy filled with a beautifully flavoured and balanced cream.

The pistachio and vanilla fillings were authentic. The glaze and nutty garnishes enhanced the flavour and provided a needed crunchy texture elevating the desserts.

There isn't indoor seating so I'd recommend either carefully taking the clairs home or having it in a nearby garden Jardin des Rosiers Joseph Migneret. the Eclairs were not what they used to be. A Years back they used to be exquisite  a pity.

They looked boring and tasted very average. Will not come back. The macaroons tasted surprisingly good. Delicious cakes we got red berries and passion fruit ones they were goey inside as well so nice! Very good clairs and nice service, I also liked chocolate Easter eggs. It is a pity though that there is no place to sit down and eat clairs like in this other venue","Monday: 11:00 AM – 2:00 PM, 3:00 – 7:00 PM

Ritz Paris Le Comptoir,"38 Rue Cambon, 75001 Paris, France",4.1,48.8688063,2.3276317,"One of the best madeleines in the Paris city are at this bakery. There is almost always a line outside and rightfully so.

By the evening they are usually sold out with few pastries. The staff is nice and helpful.
There is an option of takeaway which most people prefer considering there is limited seating.

Very centrally located and falls way on great strolls. Highly recommend this bakery. Beautiful shop, wonderful service, flawless presentation, but sadly super underwhelming pastries. I had a raspberry Madeline and a strawberry tart. The Madeline was tasty, with a tart jelly in the center and a sweet coating, but not something I would go out of my way to eat again for 8. The strawberry tart was 90 whipped cream with a good cookie base, but no other real flavor outside of the strawberries on top. I am very whelmed in my experience, versus how hyped up this place was for how it performed taste wise. Honestly, save your money and get like 23 pastries somewhere else unless you want to take pictures of the gorgeous interior. We visited this boutique yesterday and were confronted with unacceptable behavior from the staff. I wanted to sit at a table that had not been cleared while my husband placed the order. The lady raised her voice at me, almost shouting, intimidating all the customers in the boutique and creating total silence. I understand that her job is not easy, but in no case is it acceptable to behave like that with customers, especially in one of the best pastry shop in the world. It is neither professional nor humane.

Otherwise, the boutique is great in terms of taste we loved the cookie and the hot chocolate. Got the riz au lait pate a tartiner, really underwhelming. The whole chocolatecookie layer is way too sweet couldnt eat more than two bites and the ritz au lait sadly has not flavour whatsoever. Definitely not worth 16, had to take to go as there is very limited seating My favorite pastry shop in Paris and a must visit every time Im there.

Odette,"77 Rue Galande, 75005 Paris, France",4.4,48.8520569,2.3465064,"We bought a box of Odettes delicious cream puffs as they were recommended by our Paris guide. She declared that they were the very best and she certainly was right! We tried a variety and they were all delicious! My wife and I had eaten cream puffs before, but these were on another level! We still talk about them! The cream puffs are so good! A little pricey individually but worth trying. Great selection of flavours to choose from. The most iconic Choux in Paris 
A very Parisian cafe located behind  Shakespeare and Company and looking directly at Notre Dame de Paris this little cafe offers not only a great ambience and delicious Choux but a very Parisian spirit.

To begin with the service is great  The girl was very helpful, friendly and welcoming. She was also very fast to serve us.
We spent a lovely time in the caf and enjoyed our stay there. Needless to say that the Choux are delicious and out of this world.
They are of different flavours and rich in texture and taste.
I opted for the Pistachio one and my daughter chose the one with raspberry 
Even though the Choux is quite small, it is absolutely fulfilling. The coffee was also great and the hot chocolate that my daughter had.
The prices are super affordable and reasonable taking into account the location and the view on Notre Dame that it has.
Thus, if you want to spend a lazy and quiet evening in the very heart of Paris, France, definitely go to Odette.

I myself will definitely be returning there the next time I am in Paris 

Highly Recommend  Best cream Puff near Notre dame, amazing terrasse ! So much worth it!
A cream puff is 2,5 goes lower as you buy more, 1 bite of divine pleasure.

The cream puffs are very good, amazingly good in fact, you have about 89 variety that dont seem to change and always a different Chou  cream puff of the month.
You can order as few as just one and sit on their terrasse, what a treat. One can also order different sizes of boxes and tower made out of it.
This is one of my favorite terrasse of Paris, it overlooks Notre dame, its on a piece of sidewalk that is very quiet and for most of sheltered from the rain.
There are toilets on the second floor, on and the first floor you can also enjoy the view of Notre dame from your chair.
Definitely a must go to places while on the Latin quarter or at Notre dame. If youre in the vicinity, stop by for a caf and cream puff filled with the most delicious pastry cream flavored with the likes of praline  raspberry chocolate or passion fruit. Sitting upstairs in one of their tiny rooms overlooking the park below, youll catch sight of Notre Dane directly across the way. Theres nothing more Parisian than sipping your afternoon pick me up and admiring our grand lady in the midst of her post fire renovation, with a rainbow overhead no less.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Takumi Pâtisserie,"29 Rue des Pyramides, 75001 Paris, France",4.0,48.8662862,2.3338041,"We had the matcha cheesecake and it was lovely but also the staff was so friendly!! They were so nice, I can't give less than 5 stars. I would love to see smaller cheesecakes as we were doubtful of getting one as it was only 2 of us will def get it morr often if they had smaller sizes!! I have come across many positive recommendations for cheesecake, but I am not impressed with their quality today. Despite my love for matcha, this flavor does not meet my expectations, and the original cheesecake is just average.
Could you consider saying 'Hello' to clients when they enter the shop as part of your service? There were only us at that time. Gorgeous and delicious pastries!! We stumbled upon this while shopping and went back just for more two days later! We had the black sesame and yuzu tarts and some rice balls. All so good!! I tried Matcha cheese tart, it's amazing!
I like that it's not too sweet, and intense matcha.
It's hard to find good quality Matcha in Europe, but here it is!

The first bite I tried, I felt it's authentic japanese matcha. I wish they sell Matcha latte drink too.

The onigiri is average, not much filling. Next time sandro and the bento set looks all good. You can find tasty japanese cheesecakes here. We tried the original one and it was more than enough for four people. You can get cutlery from them. There is open kitchen and you can see everything. Highly recommended!","Monday: Closed

Great place to go to if you are strolling around champs elysees
Its a lovely place to enjoy your dessert. Very good dessert. The cakes were probably some of the best I have had. Macaroons were ok. Service of good. Its a good place for people watching and enjoying some afternoon tea. The Isfahan croissant was amazing!!
It's got a rose, lychee and raspberry sorbet filling on the inside and is just amazing!
It was so good that after finishing one among four of us, we went and brought another!

We heard that this place was known for a little more unique flavors of macarons, so came for that.

ISPAHAN Rose, Letchi  Raspberry  really creative and unique. It even had some jam filling on the inside which was probably raspberry jam or something? But whatever it was, it was really nice!

INFINIMENT PRALIN PISTACHE Pistachio  praline  lovely flavor here! Very soft and smooth and just delicious.

INFINIMENT CHOCOLAT PAINEIRA Pure Origin Dark Chocolate Brazil   If you are a fan of dark chocolate, you will like this one. It actually is really rich!

PLAISIR SUCR Milk Chocolate  Flaky Praline  Actual milk chocolate flavor here. Not too rich or anything. Like eating milk chocolate.

MOGADOR Milk Chocolate  Passion Fruit  Another one of their classics It was fairly sweet for me, but dad loved it.

INFINIMENT VANILLE DE MADAGASCAR Vanilla from Madagascar  actually very simple, but nice in its own way.

INFINIMENT PRALIN NOISETTE Hazelnut Praline  Crunchy Praline  Real good!! I'm not usually a hazelnut fan but this was wow! Macrons awesome  very fresh. Very authentic French taste. And the Stawberries pistachio pastry was yummy. Came here for ice cream, as his ice cream in London is fantastic. We got the vanilla macaron one. It was bad.

Berthillon,"31 Rue Saint-Louis en l'Île, 75004 Paris, France",4.4,48.8517232,2.3567354,"I ordered a triple scoops of icecream and chose cherry, chocolate, and strawberry. However, it was served incorrectly as coffee, chocolate, and strawberry. I informed the staff that the wrong item was served. A new icecream was served again, but they just scooped out the coffee flavor from the originallyserved ice cream and put the cherry in it. It seemed, during this process, the chocolate ice cream underneath had melted a lot. Even the coffee ice cream was left inside, ruining the taste. It was annoying when the coffee flavor entered my mouth unexpectedly. It is possible for the staff to get the order wrong, but the process for correcting it is unprofessional. The staff said it was to keep the ice cream that was originally served from being thrown away, but why should costumers pay full price for a substandard product? I strongly request that they make it again from the beginning if it is served incorrectly next time. The cues are long but so so worth it when take the first lick! Fabulous ice cream. I tried the blood orange,the wild peach, the chocolate with nuts and raisins and the cacao whisky. The blood orange was my favorite! But the rest was great too. one of my most favourite icecream parlours of all time  a must try in Paris. The icecream itself is very popular and well known among the Parisians. The vibe and how you can eat it out of the metal sunday bowl was just fun  and after all, the coffee and wild strawberry icecreams were just fantastic!
the service was a plus too! The BEST ice cream shop! Highly recommend coming to enjoy a nice break from the heat and to order some delicious sorbet and other ice cream.

They offer a three scoop combo with whipped cream and coulis, which is quite lovely.

My favorite dish here is the Coupe Belle Hlne, which has both pear sorbet and vanilla. Their praline crackers that come with each scoop is also delicious!

The servers speak both English and French, and like most French restaurants, they have impeccable service. The ice cream here is worth the hype  possibly a top spot in all of Europe and it would for sure make a worlds best ice cream list. .  Two things to take note of 1. The staff is super busy and, being Parisian, werent fond of my son asking for samples and they expected us to know what flavors we wanted to order. This is status quo in Paris establishments  the people often just suck and come across as rude. 2. Try a flavor you normally wouldnt try. Some of their best flavors arent your typical chocolate, vanillas, berry, etc.  impatient service aside this place rocks.","Monday: Closed

A very popular bakery often with lines out the door, standing room only and a decent range of pastries and breads.

Croissant  buttery, flakey and reasonably priced. Light and airy with some structure.

Eclair  delicious, light, chocolatey. Sweeter side.

Worth a visit and worth the short wait. REVISED
The best boulangerie of the year.
And the master of briochs I tried all kinds they make.

Despite their flawless products, the staff knows how to remain friendly, helpful and efficient in a hectic working environment where people are desperately queuing for freshly baked bread and pastries that are undoubtedly worth queuing for. aot 2024

Oh, their croissant beats many other trendy boulangeries around the area, and the overall price is fair!

I usually avoid visiting popular or touristic bakeries in Paris, but this is an exception. I tried their brioch au sucre, brioch feuillete aux pommes and cookies. All of them are SUPERB! The cookies are crunchy, embellished with naturally scented nuts and the bittersweetness of dark chocolate. The brioch au sucre has a thin crust and a soft, buttery interior. I ate it one day after, and it didnt turn dry like many other mediocre ones given its ingredients and texture, brioch generally has a longer freshness span than leaner bread. The brioch feuillete is the most surprising one among the three. The flavour is a perfect blend of rich butter and a delicate sweetness from a bit of apple pure in the centre. Fortunately, its not so close to our place my belly and wallet must suffer otherwise. juin 2024 Not into cake, but thought I'd pay a visit here. A queue when I arrived, usually a good sign.

The cake pictured was lovely. Very tasty and beautifully presented. I can see why it's popular. Well worth a visit. Lovely staff too. This is traditional local baker. There are lines, and sometimes they set up tables to eat on the deck and sometimes they dont. But I have gone here almost everyday. It is really decently priced. I get a chocolate croissant and sometimes a baguette or sandwich and sometimes both. Lunch and a treat under 10 is always great when travelling. Wish I took photos but I almost always eat everything too quickly.","Monday: Closed

The gelato was DELICIOUS  get the basic chocolate you wont regret it. The staff are so nice, the lady behind the counter told me I can choose as many flavours as I wanted. I recommend this! Delightful presentation of the real thing gelato in Paris!

Loved my hazelnut and vanilla rose and the sweet service with which it was delivered! Please try pistachio and Coffee here!  Very good I took a detour from rue de Rivoli just to grab some gelato, and let me tell you, the gelato was fantasticbut the speed? Unbelievable! I barely had time to blink. One guy asked what I wanted, I tapped my phone to pay, and before I knew it, a girl handed me my 'medium cup, half vanilla, half pistachio.' In and out with my treat in hand in under 30 seconds! Fastest gelato run of my life! They have so many unique flavors, such as blood orange ginger, citron basil, passion fruit etc. the fruit flavors all taste natural and fresh, unlike some places they use artificial sweetener or syrup. The waffle cone was very crunchy, thick and tasty. No wonder they open so many branches","Monday: 12:00 – 11:00 PM

BRIGAT',"6 Rue du Pas de la Mule, 75003 Paris, France",4.8,48.8560302,2.3672925,"During my visit to Paris, I discovered this place. One word AMAZING.

The staff is extremely helpful and caring. The pastries are to die for, and the sweets are the best in town for me. I've visited many places, from highend to lowkey, and this one stands out. Before I leave, I will definitely go back.

The coffee is great, and we took away one of the fruit breads, which was also amazing. Honestly, well done. This place is full of passion and care. Thank you for such a wonderful experience! The things  that we didnt like
1  , the coffee is absolutely horrible. Dont go there for the coffee. Its from this automatic machines and the taste is really bad.
2 the space is really small, barely 3 tables to seat
3 if you order for at there you pay a small extra surcharge
4 they handle cash and at the same time they cut the bread.. I would suggest to keep and eye on the hygiene

What we liked
1The pastries, everything was super tasty. The croissant was super crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.

2The team was super nice and extremely helpful !  

3 We bought different types of bread to take away. Amazing taste and flavor. Chausson de pomme was really good. The croissants are fresh when you come early. No line ups for me. Can't go wrong here for some great parisan bakery The best pastry that we tried in Paris. Staff were friendly and the service was quick. There are spaces to eat inside too. Amazing little patisserie. The staff were so friendly and spoke English very well. The man we spoke to took the time to explain all the pastries to us and how they were made. Not only were they beautifully made but they tasted as good as they looked. I would definitely come back.","Monday: Closed

Amazing gelato and good portions served. You can choose as many flavors as you want in any size order.
Staff is friendly and welcoming.
Would definitely come back for dessert here  You must try this place when you're in Montmartre! It's my second time visiting Paris and my second time having Amorino ice cream here. Despite reading many comments about unfriendly staff, I had great service. The girl who made my ice cream was so focused and turned it into a work of art. There are so many options that it's hard to choose from. I paid 5.50 for three different flavors of Amorino ice cream. Don't miss this spot and enjoy some delicious ice cream!  Amorino Gelato in Paris offers the best ice creams with natural flavors, each delicately shaped into a beautiful flower, making for a perfect presentation. It's definitely a mustvisit for gelato lovers in the city of lights! Best ice cream! A must try. The staff were very nice and there is outdoor seating.","Monday: 12:00 – 11:30 PM

Berko,"23 Rue Rambuteau, 75004 Paris, France",3.7,48.8607614,2.3545182,"Would you pay 70 for this? The cake looks nothing like the one I ordered. It looks like they threw together leftover cake trimmings, slapped some dead flowers on top, and called it a day. The photo shows a comparison of the cake I received vs the one shown on their website. Classic case of false advertising. My favorite bakery! as a big fan of red velvet, this place makes the best one so far, you can taste the cheese cream frosting and all the right ingredients, what an amazing job! whenever I come to Paris I always have to stop there and get me some, it is a pure delight!!! I Berko is my secret haven in Paris as an American living in France. I must say, they have the best Red Velvet in Paris, and I'm not exaggerating. The cake is dense yet fluffy, and the Cream Cheese flavor is authentic, comparable to the Red Velvet at the Waldorf Astoria in the U.S.  truly outstanding.

Furthermore, Berko is the pioneer of Cupcakes in Paris, with a 23year history, making them the founding figure of Parisian Cupcakes. My personal favorite is the Raspberry Velvet, and despite their small size, you can easily indulge in several at once. The Cupcake toppings are spot on, each with its own layers, combining French finesse with the relaxed texture of American desserts.

In conclusion, I personally love Berko and highly recommend it. Ive placed orders a few times for a preordered and customized cake, for several occasions which have been delicious and pretty! Their small cupcakes are an absolute delight! I tried a red velvet cupcake and a raspberry red velvet one. The cream cheese was nice but the cake was too dry to my taste. For the red coloring, I could tell from the look that it was natural, maybe beetroot, because it was more on the brickbrownish shade. But overall, it was nice. Their other cakes looked so inviting. If I pass the shop again, Ill try more.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:30 PM

Boulangerie pâtisserie BOM,"28 Pl. Saint-Ferdinand, 75017 Paris, France",4.8,48.8782405,2.2883111,"This place is worth getting up early for and you should go early because the pastries go quickly. Ill definitely be back again on my next trip to Paris. The pastries are just delightful. and still tasted great after an 8 hour flight. So yum. If you are staying near the Arc de Triomphe, it is worth to visit this boulangerie. I had the jambon beurre, brioche, and rhubarb tart, and those were so delicious! I also got a free drink which is a event for buying both sandwich and dessert. Moreover, this boulangerie opens earlier and closes later than other stores. If I had known about this place earlier, I would have come to buy some bread every morning, and I wouldn't have spent my money for breakfast at the cafe near my hotel. I am grateful to staffs with beautiful smiles and hope to see U again  There are many pastry shops around Paris and so to stand out from them all, you need to be special. This place bakes baguette multiple times through out the day until they close at 8pm so you can have freshest baguette all throughout the day. We first visited at 4pm, and the baguette was warm! Softly crispy on the outside and soft and tender inside  WOW.

We were lucky to have tried the seasonal fog danish amongst countless pastores. The pastry was crispy and beautifully layered.

Don't bother with the chain pastry across the street with flashy interior. If you want baguette and pastries made traditional way without the fanfare, this is the place to go.

We visited this place Every day while we were in Paris. It is the most delicious baguette bakery in Paris!
I stayed for 2weeks in Paris and tried to have  baaguettes in many places.but BOM is the best. A nice little bakery. I came during lunchtime and it was quite busy, but they were handling it perfectly. I was served fast but with a smile and all the necessary attention. The sandwich and the croissant were tasty.","Monday: 6:30 AM – 8:00 PM

Definitely will come again.

P.S. the place is super tiny, with just a small table by the window, so more of a togo or quick soloduo biteandrun. Fantastic approach! Their pastry creations are made with up to 65 less sugar that traditional pastries and still taste so good! A perfect destination for those with sugar related illnesses or just if you want a guilt free treat. The cheesecake is my absolute favorite, so airy and creamy pure pleasure! We tried the chocolate tart and the lemon pistachio cake. It was okay but not less sweet than a regular bakery, we were expecting something with much less sweetness considering these are low glycemic index deserts. Delicious sugarreduced pastry. Lemon was ok, berries one was underwhelming by using only plain sweetened whip cream. At the prices they charge It's hard to recommend.","Monday: Closed

Mollé Pâtisserie 甜品工坊3区,"27 Rue au Maire, 75003 Paris, France",4.3,48.8646292,2.3560295,"I will never recommend this bakery. This is the worst bakery I have ever been to! I ordered a birthday cake. They didnt make any requirements I had offered. It looks disgusting and tastes really bad, we almost puked after eating the cake. And they asked for 100 euros for a 6 inch cake. Very conveniently located near the metro Arts et Mtiers and among the other Asian cantines and supermarkets, this patisserie is the place to be to have a quick dessert break without breaking the bank.
I took the taro bread and bubble tea, both were delicious, good quality for the price. Unfortunately they didnt have green bubble tea and did not offer bigger sized cup so I had to go for black tea based and standard sized cup, I guess to be able to have more choice of drinks it is better to arrive early. In any case I think their specialityfocus is the patisserie not so much the bubble tea business.
They also offer custom made cakes I would try that next time.
Service was good and staff were friendly. All cream pastries are always delicious. The cream is fluffy, just right not too sweet. The bread is always perfectly soft and springs back. The pork floss desserts are done with mastery, we were expecting thick layers of Mayo inside but it was sweet cream. Still delicious.

Previously tried their sausage rolls, brings back to childhood in Asia! All the cakes are made at the day! 
strawberry cake is so GOOD Best bread and pastry store with original Chinese taste in Paris! High recommended no matter where you are from. For the sweet bread, my favorite one is the pain au fromage. Super good! And for the salty ones, you must try the Roul avec porc sch. The staffs are really friendly and efficient to explain all my questions, which I appreciate a lot. Cant help going there everyday!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:30 PM

Bulliz,"14 Rue d'Hauteville, 75010 Paris, France",4.6,48.87154949999999,2.3499713,"So Many flavors to choose and each of them is so unique and extra. I had tiramisu, raspberry rose, pistachio orange, strawberry verbena, mango olive thyme and they are all good. Prices are reasonable as well. I wish they rotate the flavors so that I can try other new flavors. I had a latte which was coffee with milk no latte art and the price was 3.5 and a Choux a Lacreme 1.9 the taste was fine. A kind lady staff try to help me a little although she didnt speak english. They have also fresh fruit juice if someone is interested. Amazing quality and flavour. We loved it! Service was prompt and friendly  Very delicious choux, soft, great quality and filled with tasty cream. I discovered this shop by accidentally while I was visiting a restaurant in Paris. The shop is small but nice, clean and cozy. The seller is very nice and friendly. Will absolutely come back here. I had vanilla and salted caramel choux.

They're freshsqueezed orange juice was great as well. Delicious food provided by good staff. Would highly recommend the cookie, it was absolutely delightful. I would recommend getting takeaway if you can as it is about 20 percent more to eat in. You would like to try all cakes they are so tasty cant resist.
I always take a Flan and a coffee.
Make a brake after a long walk. Everything we ate here was delicious. It was our goto for breakfast and we had sandwiches for lunch several days. The only complaint is our order was missing at item a few times not surprising since we were speaking broken french and ordering a lot. The only thing that wasn't amazing was the coffee which was just soso. Staff was very friendly. Amazing service from the team. Beautiful place and very kind. The best in Chatelet and in Paris.

Friendly staff , super clean
Make sure you get the pistachio and the flan I visited this place several times when I came to Paris. They have great selections of delicious Ptisserie.
The shop is very small with only two table outside to eatin. Otherwise its great for takeaway. Desserts are very special, interesting combinations of tastes, fruits, and textures. The decoration is attentively made. We tried the rhubarb rose and flan. So this is very unique place!
They take from something like 12 patisserie chef every month one dessertchocolatecake etc and sell only that so the costumer can taste from all around the best of Paris.
Great idea!
And the pistachio tart is just unbelievable, wow!!! Just go and take it!
The service is also a key when they let you know everything about the choices and help you choose The most delicious pastries we tried in Paris! Exquisite and pleasing your taste buds. We tried raspberry tart and pistachio one, raspberry is our new favorite now. Perfect sweet balance, bouquet of flavors, nice look. On the pricey side but well worth it.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Paris Baguette,"11 Rue Jean Lantier, 75001 Paris, France",4.0,48.8585036,2.346079899999999,"We tried several pastries this morning, their pastries and cakes are soooo delicious! Must try lemon meringue tart which has the right amount of tartness and no over powering sweet, highly recommended! The raspberry croissant is so flaky yet so moist in the inside! Simply scrumptious! A bit of a touristic version of the classic French bakery by a Korean group totally undercover and posing as an old French brand. Not bad but nothing extraordinary. Very annoying to be systematically asked he you want a coffee when you say you just want this or that.They always try to push you to buy something else which doesn't make you want to come back. In terms of french tradition, I prefer the original this asian copy... Everything was delicious!! The stuff is very kind. I tried to order in French, but they realised Im a tourist and they started to talk in English. I really appreciate that  bonus tip you have to try the almond croissant  Chain from South Korea. Good but nothing wow. Coffee fell flat. Had better baguette sandwiches from other places nearby. It is my favorite boulangerie ptisserie in Paris and has many branches all over the city. This particular branch is located behind the Thtre du Chtelet and has tables inside as well as on the sidewalk. It is worth trying the croque monsieur, the quiche lorraine and from the desserts the raspberry croissant and the Madagascar vanilla flan.

Kl Pastry,"78 Av. de Villiers, 75017 Paris, France",4.4,48.8842142,2.3036484,"I went here on the 26th of July, opening Ceremony night. It was raining. My 5 year old son and I were in the area and I really wanted a coffee, so i see this place as I'm walking to my destination and I'm like let's get a coffee and a dessert while we also escape the rain. It was 525pm when I got in. I saw 3 people sitting on the table eating. I got excited seeing this place , took out my camera and even recorded it, thinking it will be a great mom son date.

I go in and we're looking what's there, my son gets excited and starts calling the lady out madame madame.  I told him not to call out like that, we will try and get a place to sit and the lady was like oh we are closed for sit in. It is 530pm now. I'm like oh are you. She said yes but you can do take out. I was like hmm I don't know I really wanted to sit and enjoy but my son was eyeing the clair and was like I want one. I was like we can go else where. I asked the lady hey do you do drinks for take away too. She goes what are you after?I was like tea or coffee. Then she proceeded to tell me ' no that's closed too now but franprix is next door' . I told her, I'm not interested in that.

I came out of the door, as I was leaving I saw the back of the sign for the shop hours, I then looked at the opening hours and it is open until 630pm. I checked on Google, I checked on their website, sure enough that's the hours. I was first of all left very shocked,  but also you kind of gaslight yourself into thinking it is not what you think it is, aka rcism or some kind of discrimination.

Imagine this, on the night of the opening night of Olympics when paris is flooded with tourists and this employee was  essentially saying no by simply looking at me.

We are big desserts and chocolate fans, and try such places wherever we travel. This being in the 17th so close to where we live, could have Been a place I'd frequent with my family and my friends. But sure enough, this is the end of it and I'll be sure to spread the word to everyone to avoid this place at all cost. If it isn't good enough for us to sit in, it isn't good enough for our money to be spent here!!!!

I'm actually upset that I bothered to spend a penny here after this really leave a horrible taste in your mouth experience.

Thank you Kevin for responding, but an apology doesn't rectify the root cause issue. I'm really curious what will be done on your part to address that this sort of thing doesn't happen again? I'm still not sure why I was discriminated because your response below proves I was indeed discriminated as you are admitting that the shop doesn't close at 530. Was I discriminated because I'm not white, or wax it that the lady thought I cannot afford the place or was it because i came in with a child? Or any other form of discrimination?

It is important for you as a business to train your employees properly in customer service and also in diversity and inclusion training especially because this happened on the opening night of the Olympics, thousands of tourists will be flocking to Paris. Your location is in a very heavy expat area plus tourists will drop by. If you'd sort of behaviour continues by your employees, it will yield significant loss to your business, which I assume you have put your heart and soul into.

Also, it was not both the ladies I talked with but just the one manning the till, dark hair, big glasses.

Thanks, I look forward to hearing from you.

I arrived at 525pm,not 550pm. As I've stated earlier. So I got lucky to visit this amazing patisserie  and more lucky to meet the ownerchef patisserie of the place.
When you enter you feel like you just got in a michelin star restaurant, every detail is on spot, clean and I love the window to the prep area.
We took salted caramel and macadamia tart that was sublime and chocolate eclair and canele that eas the best I got to taste in Paris.
Wow Don't go there! I recently visited this patisserie in Paris 17th, lured by their claim of having the best SaintHonor. Unfortunately, my experience was far from what I expected.It was for my GrandMother 94 Birthday 11th of July

The SaintHonor was terrible. The taste was off, and the cream had probably turned. Additionally, the service was equally disappointing. The staff was inattentive and unhelpful, making the overall experience unpleasant.
We reported our experience to the store , and the answer was even worse. At Patisserie KL, I found that they dismiss any form of criticism and their client service leaves much to be desired.

I do not recommend visiting this patisserie. Save your time and money by choosing a different spot for your pastry cravings. Tried their flan. Lots of puff pastry and an extremely tasty one, beautifully puffy and delicious. Sadly they dont sell a slice so you have to buy a full one 4 pers.
Tried 10 flans Bristol, Jardin sucr, tapisserie, KL, Couvreur, Mam, Jojo, Brigat, conticini, Meunier, to my taste, its the number 4 after Bristol, jardin sucre and tapisserie. For sure worth a visit Big fan of patisserie. I tried all the galette des rois this year Grolet, Herme, lignac, lenotre, michalak, Ducasse etc and I have to say the best one comes from Kevin Lacote by far. So while I was there, I tried a few goodies. The pink praline brioche is out of this world, the hazelnut cake is deliciously moist and tasty, the vanilla flan is perfectly balanced, the cannelets are probably the best in Paris, the saint honor is unbelievable. All very well structured, with an amazing crust base and the sugar on the low side which is good.
Definitely one of the top patisserie in Paris","Monday: Closed

They serve freshly made Mochi that's wonderfully chewy, unlike the frozen ones you might find elsewhere.
I sampled four different flavors, from matcha to lemon yuzu, but the almond with orange blossom stole the show for me. The unique combination, especially during the spring season, made it the perfect treat for the moment.
While it might not become my regular haunt, it's still a great spot to pamper yourself with some delightful Japanese delicacies. Lovely mochis. The seller is so nice, very friendly, very welcoming, very passionate about the products. She explains all the flavors of mochi really well. And we really enjoy the desserts. I give 45 because its a bit expensive. Price range high per mochi, however they are fresh, gooey inside, with a large filling and delicious flavours. We got yuzu, matcha and black sesame kindly recommended by the waitress and cut them in half to share for two! The best thing is that the mochi are vegan Freshest lightest most delicious mochi. I enjoyed a black sesame one. Definitely coming back for more. Yuzu is the best! Highly recommended.

I wish I had a chance to try more of their goodies but highly recommend!! Every time we come to Paris, we can't resist stopping by Ptisserie Alexine. It's a must for us! Their chocolate clairs are simply delicious, and everything from the crpes to the baguettes is amazing. Each visit feels like a treat, with fresh, flavorful pastries that never disappoint. The pain au chocolate was good, but the croissants with almond and chocolate wasn't really tasty. No table just for takeaway  Love their baguette and tarte citron. Yummy! Best quiche of our lives!! Best pain au chocolat I had in Paris so far.","Monday: 6:45 AM – 8:20 PM

Came across this place. It was indeed small but there was a queue.
So wanted to kill our hunger pangs and try the food there.
We ordered Churros only. Was really nice. It was made in front of us fresh. With Nutella, it was really ticking all the boxes.
We saw the crpes being prepared, but didn't go for it as had to meet someone.

5 X, all the way in all ways.

People were very friendly. Not sure if they were owners or workers. Either way, they were too good.

Overall atmosphere was too good in and around the place.
Given an opportunity, yes will definitely go there again. Good, hot, fresh crepes to go. Would have again if I'm in the area! Cheaters. Average waffles and they overcharged for a supplement speculoos. Better buy a waffle at Cafe de Beaubourg at the same price for better quality Nice churros prepared to order in fresh oil. Also good crepes. Very good churros, fried in clean oil and they used original Nutella",no operation time,"restaurant, food, point_of_interest, store, establishment"

Well located in the heart of the 7th district, this French pastry shop from the renowned Chef Philippe Conticini serve some of the best pastries in the city! The Paris Brest has won some awards as best Paris Brest in Paris and it was really good! The price is a bit high as you could expect but once in a while, it's a nice treat  Rather small shop, famous for the huge croissants. You can get it now without having to preorder. Fun idea with friends. We xame here to try the stunning croissant XXL and you can see my reel in my IG profile merceonearth

The lady was very attentive and welcoming. Helped us find the specific type that we were looking for and added a small box as a gift in our bag. I wish we could buy their chocolate in the US too! Pretty packaging. Candies are not the best. But I still buy them as souvenirs. The Japanese staff there spoke French whole time when I asked a very simple question in English. It would have been nice if at least a little effort had been made to use basic English so that foreign visitors like me could understand what she said because she seemed she fully understood English. There arent enough good things to say about this shop. The products are top quality, of course, and they are the perfect gift as they represent so well the history of confectionery in Paris. The most impressive however is the quality of the service. Every time I have gone in to this store in the last two years, I am greeted with a smile and helpful advice. I recently requested a large order, and the Boissier representative had a bag prepared and waiting for me upon my return. Incredibly thoughtful! Thank you. I saw it online and the candy and cans were cute, so I decided to visit.

I bought chocolate coated with sugar and candies with syrup inside.
Both the container and the paper bag are very cute and I am satisfied!
At the end, I got a piece of candy to taste.
It was delicious and I can't wait to give it to a friend.

When I told them about the trouble I had on my trip, the Japanese staff were very kind and helpful. thank you very much. This is a store with really friendly clerks. The staff explains the products in detail and helps you taste them. The store was pretty, and the candy I bought here was delicious. I want to visit again next time.","Monday: 12:00 – 7:00 PM

Lots of variety from breads to pasteries to desserts, all very affordable. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for a great bakery near the Eiffel Tower. BEAUTIFUL CAFE IN THE HEART OF PARIS

 If you are in the area, this is a beautiful bakery to visit. The staff are friendly, the pasties and delicious and it is seriously affordable!

We ordered a baguette and a croissant as tourists and they were so tasty and absolutely to die for It is one of the most beautiful cafes near the street heading to the Eiffel Tower. It includes a variety of delicious French baked goods. I very much enjoyed this beautiful and distinguished cafe by sitting in it for breakfast. I picked up assorted baked goods for breakfast for myself and my spouse and we both agreed that the quality was simply lacking. Beautiful presentation at the boulangerie, but the food tasted like it was leftover from the day prior. Not fresh tasting, and a sad reminder that I should have returned to La Parisienne across the street. Comparatively, more expensive than La Parisienne as well. The orange juice was good, but didn't make up for the lackluster food. While there are many superior options for breakfast and baked goods on Rue St Dominique, if you have to come here, I do recommend the moelleux chocolate with salted caramel and the orange juice. Otherwise, skip this place and head over to the far superior La Parisienne, a better treat for your bouche and pocketbook. Stopped by Liberte while walking to other activities and picked up snacks, coffee, and a ham sandwich. Everything was absolutely delicious and well priced. Service was fast as well.

Clove Bakery,"69 Rue Greneta, 75002 Paris, France",4.5,48.8655304,2.3474173,"So happy with my chocolate and vanilla birthday cake! I got exactly what I hoped for. The cake was delicious and spongy and just the right amount of chocolate, the buttercream was great and the presentation too. Highly recommend as I know no other place like it in Paris! Clove Bakery made us an amazing three tier wedding cake  vanilla, carrot and chocolate. Not only was it gorgeous, elegant and refined to look at  but absolutely delicious. They were super easy to deal with and communication was smooth and efficient. Id 100 recommend if you want a more Anglosaxon cake for your big day  grand merci ! This is a fantastic American bakery. Everything we ordered was fresh, moist and baked to perfection. The frosting very important was legit. Being an expat I appreciate this bakery so much. Don't get me wrong, I love the boulangerie and patisseries here in Paris but I do miss these types of treats and desserts. Highly recommend! So happy that I found this bakery.  I needed an American cake and not being a baker and far from achieving anything in baking , I was so relieved that Stoney Clove had one cake left.  Red Velvet!  Exactly what I needed. I also purchased oatmeal raisin cookies as well.  Everything was delicious.  It's a tiny place and the ladies hustle to get their goodies out. Love this place, I'll definitely be going back and will also order in advance. In a city where classic ptisserie is what people are mainly seeking, I often find myself yearning for classic American treats like cupcakes, pies and cakes. You would think that the French bakers could easily make something as simple as a cupcake. They have tried many times but they get it totally wrong and dont even come close. They also dont understand the simplicity and beauty of  the fruit pie. I felt hopeless for a really long time that I could enjoy these American ptisserie classics that are overshadowed by the French ones. Then I happened to stumble upon Stoney Clove Bakery. Not only did they have the cakes, pies, brownies, and all the indulgences I missed so much, but they are next level amazing in what they make. When I have surprised French people with something like a red velvet cupcake, you see that look in their eye when they take their first bite. Its their realization that they have never really had a cupcake before and this is what we Americans were trying to tell them about. Stoney Clove Bakery is the legit real deal and they may be small but what they make is truly magic. Red Velvet cake is my favorite, but in the summertime the pies are heavenly and a great addition to a picnic.","Monday: Closed

The croissant was one of the best I've ever hadextremely buttery and perfectly flaky. Each bite was a delightful experience. If you're in Paris and looking for an exceptional croissant, I highly recommend Tout Autour Du Pain. Family owned boulangerie. Very good flavor baguettes with simple ingredients. Baguettes a bit chewy.  Other petite pain are really good and flavorful too, like fig and nuts pain. Agreed with other comments that bees fly around the pastries. The absolute BEST croissant  and pastry. It was fresh, delicious, warm n perfect!!!  Wonder why the ratings are not better here. Our absolute favorite bakery in France! Favorites are fruit tarts and baguettes. This are the best croissants I ever ate in my life. They are crispy on the outside, slightly caramelized at the bottom and fluffy on the inside. When they come straight out of the oven and still warm it is even better. The staff is also very friendly and tries it's best with non French speaking customers.

A lovely bakery with a good selection of sweets which all truly tastes amazing. ""Pistachio"" is a MUST try! Best croissant ever 
Greta place and friendly service
Really good prices as well
Proper Parisian and not a tourist trap A lot disappointing.
The Croque Monsieur was not crispy around it as it was heated in a microwave.
The quiche was warm outside and cold inside.
The chocolat chaud was watery and not so warm either.

The workers here were very kind and patient with me while I chose. There were a ton of selections and difficult to choose, and the ladies here were very sweet while I made my selection. I would return again and highly recommend this bakery. The croissants are very good with crispy bites. Different drinks are available which is nice. However the staff who served me was a bit rude to me maybe because I dont speak good French? But the place is super touristy though. Other staffs seem nice though there is a bit of waiting  line but the line goes fast. Top rated, but very touristy. The line goes quickly and they have many options from sweet pastries to savory. The bacon and cheese croissant was good after they warm it in the oven. My friend ordered a passion fruit dessert that was phenomenal. The place can get crowded and the staff overwhelmed. There were many tourists inside when we went on a Tuesday morning in August. YUM!. my god  the size of the croissants.  Amazingly good. And the girls were so nice here. Pain au chocolate was also very good. The only thing is the coffe comes out of a machine and not made with an espresso machine. A few tables to sit .but one of the best and freshest pastries here. Great spot to grab a quick sandwich or pastry! Had the vegetarian sandwich and pain praline and both we delicious. Many pastry choices to choose from.

Slight edit they offer a free croissant and espresso upon a return visit if you leave a review but getting them to honor it is a bit tough and staff was a bit rude.

Tapisserie - Motte Picquet,"16 Av. de la Motte-Picquet, 75007 Paris, France",4.4,48.85648260000001,2.3084451,"We tried two of the most hyped things on the menu, the tart syrop and the choux with vanilla cream. To be honest, both were quite overpriced and pretty underwhelming. The croissant, on the other hand, was really good. The right amount of juiciness, crunchiness, flakiness, and an intense buttery flavor. It almost seemed like the flour was a mix of wholemeal and regular, not only white flour, which gave it a nice touch.

The service could also be improved with just a smile on the cashier's face. The coffee was good for Parisian standards, but again, quite pricey. I guess the prices reflect the neighborhood, but overall expected more from the high price and the very good reviews. There are many better patisseries and boulangeries in Paris for a much lower price. A cozy and minimalist place serving sublime pastries and good coffee. simplicity refined with details and atmosphere. I tried the croissant and the fames tartlet with maple syrup and cream. Both cakes were delicious  although the tartlet required alternating black coffee and water due to its sweetness. I recommend this place near the Eiffel Tower, worth visiting and stopping for a second and take a breath Delicious coffee and fresh food. Service is really friendly. Definitely I will come back in my next trip. Delicious and quaint. Extremely happy to have chosen this location, with a much bigger sitting area to have our morning breakfast. The chocolate tart is divine and extremely well balanced. Would visit again! Went twice to Tapisserie 7eme, the viennoiseries never disappoints if you like it not super buttery. The croissant, pain au chocolat and the danish are delicious and you can see the layers crumble with each bite. Eggs are super bio and for my surprise I found herbs inside of one of them, I guess maybe some people may be bothered with this but for me it was ok. The chouquette  la flouve was a DREAM, definitely not an ordinary chou. Bad point is not petfriendly. I was with my dog and even water was denied for her. So I had a quick brunch cause I felt my dog wasnt welcome.","Monday: Closed

The cinnamon roll 3 and babka 12 are disastrous and absolutely dont match the price. Nonetheless, the worst is the male staffs attitude. He looked at us without uttering a word when we said bonjour to him. He even seemed reluctant to pick the bread for us. We wish him the best and a job he could be passionate about.

It was a paradise for fine wine, Champagne and food lovers.. undoubtedly the premier location in the world. We spent well over an hour wandering from section to section on each level discovering new brands and old of many wines and foods.

The soup bread was delicious, the mushroom pasta smelt delicious. Pastries also very good. Upstairs lots of seating, felt more like a restaurant than a cafe. Ground floor is the main pastry shop. The basement level specialises in cake and chocolate. Would give it a 4.5 overall if that was an option. Lots to choose from and good options for eating in or out. Great place for brunch  Another reviewer said the food is 5 stars and service is 0 stars, and I completely agree!

The mushroom crepe brunch and mushroom soup bread bowl brunch taste phenomenal. Other bakery items are yummy and the visuals all around are great.

But both times Ive been here, the staff have been unfriendly. When I asked which brunch item was most popular, the cashier said its up to you and provided no help at all. When I asked about the difference between two similar looking pastries, the staff member answered with immense attitude as if I was already supposed to know. Sorry Im not a French baker and sorry for burdening you with the horrific task of a simple explanation! All staff interact with you with a deadpan face, or barely any eye contact at all.

Overall, youll enjoy this place if you only eat and avoid any staff interaction. I visited this place to eat Korean style bingsu with my kids.
Valet parking is available here, and there are several tables where you can eat purchased bread, desserts, and brunch dish and the facilities are good!
We ordered Mango Bingsu and it was delicious!
Also, this place is very delicious like local French bread!!!

Great decor for a small cafepatisserie. Amazing croissants! They are very expensive 67 each, but are very good. I tried their Cookie Croissant and Spinach and Feta Croissant, and both were amazing especially the latter, which came out fresh and very creamy. They also have chairs and tables and WiFi in case you want to hang around and work. I came here for the first time today because I heard they sold macarons here and had to try them and grabbed a few other things.

The Strawberry tart was amazing  I literally ate it in the parking lot like a savage because I just couldn't wait.

The marshmallow cookie my husband got was good.

The macarons on the other hand  were extremely disappointing and concerning. Out of the 12, about 9 tasted like floor cleaner. I'm not sure if the oven they were baked in or the showcase were recently cleaned with something strong but that absolutely should not stick to the outer layer of the product. 24 down the drain  besides tasting like fabuloso I honestly couldn't tell them apart due to a lack of individual flavor. The place is realllllllly cute and they have great service. I bought Macaroons and a Sandwich. I think the only issue is that the Tuna sandwich was 10.50, pretty pricey and kind of a bummer. It was super soggy, squished down, and hard to hold without it falling apart... I also spent 24 bucks on 12 Macaroons. Hands down one of the best bakeries in the island.

Yes, it was delicious and it gets paaacked at times! I was there for a while and at least three times, one around lunch then maybe 2 pm and again around 4 it was extremely packed! Which I think its good right? Good places have lots of people coming to buy. But be aware they might not have tables available and you might have to wait 1520 min.

Lox bagel was 11.75 its small
Strawberry Machiato 67

I believe if you  are traveling in a budget this might not be the place you frequent the most bc of the prices but it worth to come at least once! Plus they have WiFi and omg its so hard to find a coffee shop with WiFi in Guam.

The bakery is a family owned business 
The owner is actually French! Probably thats why the pastries are so good!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Ive been struggling to find one that I like so a friend suggested i should try Noir, and she was right! It was amazing and the lady who made it for me did a great job, a creamy and tasty Capuccino. Ill come back on my next trips. Super nice attention too. Sweet and savoury small bites to get with your specialty coffee a Marzocco, your usual flat white, espresso a safe bet for good coffee! honestly, it's kind of hard to find a good coffee in Paris, but their filter was the best from all that i've had here.
also, baristas are really nice and this place is such a vibe! Cute little cafe in Paris for coffee and matcha latte, they have a limited space to sit inside but reasonably enough seating space outside to sit and enjoy your drink and work on your laptop, its also on a quiet street. They also have some sweets with a selection of non dairy products which are really tasty. Dont miss trying it. The stuff were sweet and kind. Definitely going back whenever Im in Paris. Best coffee in France!
Australians looking for a good coffee, found Noir and the lovely gentleman saw us and said ""flat white!?"" And then made it happen.

The decor is on point, the service is second to none and the coffee is outstanding.  Absolutely 5 star!","Monday: 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Wonderful place! Brilliant service! Staff were helpful and dedicated. A must vist! One of the few kosher Paris restaurants actually only one we found to offer a sit down Americanlike breakfast with a French spin. Hot eggs made as a French omelette, gratin, breads, etc. Next time Im going to get the eggs on croissant which looked great. Very nice service. I come here often as its one of my favorite bakeries ever. Im in love with their strudels, but especially their poppy seed one! I also love their baklava and basically everything they sell. Ive never been disappointed. I cant wait until everything opens up back up so my friends and family and I can hang out here again. Not the best bakery experience in Paris. If you want a great croissant, avoid this place. We didnt even bother finishing it. Theres a variety of other pastriesdishes to try, but I found it to be overpriced and the other pastry we had chocolate babka was way too sweet. Ill give them two stars for a good cappuccino and the baked pastries with potatocheese and spinachcheese were okay.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM

This place is so good, the ratio of tea and milk is just perfect. Tea is very fragrant and the boba is good. The interior of the place gives you of Japanese vibe. The staffs are always nice and friendly to me, very helpful. There a few options of Olong tea and she explained to me very clearly about what to pick. Can be on the expensive side for a boba but so worth it. Definitely recommend this place. Best milk tea in Paris Honestly couldnt tell you exactly what about this place made us want to go back four times while we were in Paris for a week. We randomly waltzed in here and the aesthetics inside and the drinks were perfect. Highly recommend the lavender milk tea and the rose or honey latte!! Their lavender bubble tea is amazing as always. I like its taste soo much even though its a bit pricey 8.3. But I prefer the Palais Royal location, here the interior is smaller and there are just stools. Cellular internet was not working inside, but its good that they had wifi. Was here a few times with a friend, the place is not crowded and has a great and friendly atmosphere, the employees are always nice and friendly and charged our phones when we asked them. As for food, 7 eur can be a bit of a high price for a drink, but the place provides a great variety of different teas and different types of boba, while you are also able to choose the sweetness and the amount of ice in your drink, which is a great addition. Would recommend Overrated bubble tea place, I ordered the Taro Milk Tea with slight sugar.

Very disappointed of the drink, the drink doesn't have any taste of Taro and it seems like it is 120 sugar added in it. Also, the tea flavour is super blend.","Monday: 12:30 – 7:00 PM

Personally, I would say the almond croissant and red bean butter bread are my top choices. Theyre very rich in flavor but not sugary like the some other ones. If you like the mild sweetness, this place suits you. However, coffee is on the okey side. Regardless, still worth a visit  Food is so very delicious and the staff was so friendly, but if you eat in there are only about six seats. Delicious!  There were only 3 chairs to sit. I liked the galette and the apple pie best! The almond croissant which is the best menu was less tasty than I expected ! The sliced milk bread was also tasty and soft!! This place would be the musttovisit place to me if I visit around there. Superb! Some of the best baked goods ive had in seoul. I think it would be nice if they had a trash can  water available. THe croissants are amazingly baked, crispy and soft inside. chocolate, almonds, plain ones and other kinds of pastries are quite exceptional here. I like to visit them whenever I visit Seoul. My mustvisit place for a bite of croissants. Why don't you join me? heard the owners have learned how to make pastries when they were in Australia.

We opted for the lunch set, which proved to be worth the price. While the flavors leaned slightly towards the sweet side, the overall dining experience was enjoyable. The dishes were wellprepared and provided a glimpse into authentic Korean cuisine. If you're looking for a taste of Korea in a cozy setting, Samsun is definitely worth a visit. I really like Korean cuisine, I tasted it for the first time, it was amazing! I like your restaurant. The food is very tasty, that's why I give it 5 stars!! Thank you Our family was determined to visit the restaurant during our stay in Paris because of its high ratings.  It did not disappoint!  Everything we ordered was delicious and satiated our craving for authentic Korean food.  We also loved the modern atmosphere. If in Paris this Korean place is a must. Beautifully and simply designed, great helpful staff that can leave you having a great experience dining. The food is mouthwatering with a great selection of main meals, and barbecue. Highly recommended I am very impressed with the interior and the plating. I could tell the owner made a sincere investment on the experience for customers at a traditional Korean restaurant. I could see minor tweaks on the taste but the overall quality and the taste was still above my expectations. I would visit here multiple times during my 1 week visit in Paris.

Some dishes were tasty, but they are not made fresh, rather than reheated in the ovenmicrowave, which doesnt seem right. If you come, order bibimbap to ensure food is hot, as our bulgogi was quite cold even after the reheat. Spicy squid was very tasty. Unbelievably good! Staff is wonderful, food is delicious, full in flavor, looks and sounds yeah amazing. If you order Seafood BIBIMBAP, you will not be dissapointed. It's not pricey as well. And food came really quickly! Good Korean, served in stylish dishes and a modern and cozy setting. The food is nothing exceptional, but quality is good and price is very reasonable. A great place for a quick lunch around the Opera area More of a traiteur than a restaurant. Most of the food are preprepared and either served cold or heated by microwaveoven. Lunch menu from 1319 euro. Ravioli is ridiculously small. Good for a quite bite if shopping or visiting in the neighborhood. Not a place for a gourmet experience. The place is clean and look appetizing from outside. But once we have ordered our meal, just discovered that its not done freshly, most are microwave food! I wont recommend this place if you are expecting a freshly cook meal. the bibimbap was ok because it was done freshly and not microwave.

There were also vegan noodles!

Also food came out super fast! With those prices and taste I wish I could visit this place every day. I came to Paris to try French food. However, I didnt realize I stay in a Airbnb that are surrounded by Chinese food. As somebody who was 100 made in China, I cannot believe how delicious the beef noodle soup is. A brought me back to the college days back in Shanghai. We did not have this delicious beef noodles. Soup backing Seattle United States. Love. Large portions and quick service. We got the spicy beef and vegan soups...both great! We also had edamame to start and vanilla mochi for dessert. Recommend if you're looking for a quick and easy dinner option. Fresh handmade noodles and dumplings in large portions, and most importantly, delicious. What more could you ask for Fav asian restaurant. The dumplings are to die for.

Only issue is the outdoor kitchen ventilator that leads the air to the terrace area inside the tent, so our clothes smelled like fried chicken for a couple of days  Worst japchae ever! The place is super tiny, service was quick on the beginning, and then weve been quite ignored. My drink was like a still water with alcohol. Completely not enjoyable, high hopes, zero satisfaction. We came to have dessert in this cute korean shop but we were not able to have dessert if we dont order a savoury dish which we did but we were full from our other meal. I think they could leave us just have dessert as there where space in the restaurant to sit.

Food is great though! Bonpot is a great AsianKorean option in the middle of Paris, in the Opera area. They don't have an extensive menu but the items they have are really good. And they may serve the cutest Bingsu with pink ice cream teddy bear on top.

I tried the beef pho and iced milk tea, along with the grilled chicken. The beef pho was incredibly comforting, with a simple yet flavourful broth that reminded me of authentic Vietnamese pho. The fact that the owner is Vietnamese added to the authenticity.

My friend had the chicken pho, which looked just as delicious, and I am eager to try it next time. The milk tea, with its popping boba, was a refreshing and fun treat. I will definitely be back for more! Highly recommended for anyone craving genuine Vietnamese flavours in Paris. The pho at this restaurant features a light, clear broth thats low in oil, making it ideal for healthconscious diners. The grilled pork with vermicelli is not only visually appealing but also perfectly seasoned. The milk tea is pleasantly mild in sweetness. As for the mango sticky rice, the rice is soft, warm, and chewy, with perfectly ripe mango slices covered in a layer of mango jam. Stumbled across this place after the Lourve. The food was amazing. Customer service was amazing.

Staffs were very friendly and helpful.
I definitely suggest to my guests and go back again.
Thank you very much Hidden gem near Opera! They only have lunch combos, but the food is amazing! We tried onion soup and snails for appetizers, both were very good. For main we ordered beef burginon and duck. Duck breast was out of this world, best I have tried so far. Service was efficient and proactive.

We already know what we wanted and got served in 2 minutes. The people here are friendly and helpful. The shop seems small but isn't ! It's so cosy everything about it is great. Feels like home. Let me put you all on my FAVOURITE korean restaurant. Little seoul is a small cozy restaurant which serves the best kimchi jjigae in town! I tried it for the first time last summer and after that i always find myself coming back to it. Yall can see in the photo took on different days, my order always includes kimchi jjigae which is a traditional korean kimchi soupe with porc slices served boiling hot with rice and accompanied with 3 different side dishes.
For my vegetarian friends, you can ask them to not put porc in your soup and dont worry it tastes exactly the samewith and without meat
I have came to this restaurant for around 89 times now i think , during several different occasions, sometimes with my friends,sometimes with my relatives and mostly alone. I always recommend them this restaurant and this dish specifically when it rains, you know you are going to have the best hot meal of your life there!

If i have to choose only one restaurant for the rest of my life, it would be this one!I feel like this review might have sound to you like a paid promotion but trust me its all my honest opinion. At this point they should ring me up to for being a loyal customer 

P.s   dont hesitate to go alone if your friends cant go with youas an introvert, i assure you that the owner and the workers are super friendly and nice and the place is very comfy. Bonne apptit  Most delicious Korean food I've ever had. Portions were a nice size, staff was friendly. Food is definitely spicy, so be warned. They had a good variety of dishes, and I'm definitely coming back to try some others. I recommend the ros tteokbokki and the kimchi ramen, though you really can't go wrong! A small Korean restaurant but always full of customers.  The owner and staff are all very friendly.  I ate kimbap and I love it!!  The chicken dish was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Anyway, this is a good place to share with friends!!  I will definitely be back  This is the worst spicy pork I ever had in my life.. the rice covered by the oil its not possible to eat!","Monday: 11:30 AM – 6:00 PM

The food is beyond amazing, the service is incredible and the ambiance is beautiful. The two guys working today in the front work so hard to make everyone have an amazing experience. The next time we visit Paris, this place will be one of our retuning places for sure. Merci!! I always love going to Mademoiselle, for tasty French cuisine in a quiet terrasse. Everything was good, with good portions and very good service.with maybe a couple caveat the potatoes coming with the beef tartare were kind of cold, and the chimichurri  coming with the other dish was basic. Special mention for the large decadent mascarpone cream that came with the dessert. I accidentally booked the wrong restaurant and Im so happy I did!!! The food here was exceptionally good. Our party had the duck, fillet steak and risotto  each dish was absolutely delicious. The waiter was also very friendly, and spoke to us in perfect English when he saw we were struggling in French. We were also the only group with kids definitely more a restaurant for adults  a date but the staff treated us very kindly. Thank you Chez Mademoiselle team  you were all lovely and the meal was a highlight of our 3 days in Paris. I will be back!","Monday: 12:00 – 3:00 PM, 7:00 PM – 12:00 AM

Dong Né,"15 Rue Violet, 75015 Paris, France",4.5,48.8492373,2.2945984,"They have many sets to choose or you can order what you want separately. Food tastes delicious but if you're not a big eater I recommend to order separately because the food is a lot. I order mango juice and it comes with a bottle like that. So it tastes really nice Just saw them on google maps and wanted to try bingsu. They do have interesting menus. We were greeted with ""I don't speak English"" which was the lamest joke I've ever heard. Obviously he can. We just wanted to try some food here and there because we were not big eaters and don't wanna waste leftovers. The set menu looks interesting, but it's just strictly for 1 person only No sharing! Okay If that's the policy. We were told to order 1 meal per person. He's quite too pushy and seems annoyed too. Which annoyed me as well.  I think they're not fond of tourists.
The chicken is okay some were hard. Tteokbokki serving is 14? Wow I think that's quite a lot for something like streetfood. It was good but 10 would be reasonable. That's just prolly 23 in korea  7 in Germany, but 14 in Paris!? But when I saw all the staff I understood why. Other food we ordered is price reasonable. I would give 5stars for the bingsu  Even the one I tried in Korea was not as good. Came here for dinner a little earlier than what the French normally do and was decently busy. Ordered a set and it was really good and also good value. I liked everything that I got. It started to get busy once I was leaving though Absolutely great Korean cuisine! Great place to enjoy in Paris, authentic kimbap and fried chicken served with a lunch set. Definitely worth the wait. The best Korean food compared to the ones in London. But their chocolate fondant was meh tho.","Monday: 12:00 – 4:00 PM, 6:00 – 10:00 PM

The stools are actually comfortable. The food is very good and staff is friendly. Its good for people that want to eat alone since they have counter seating. Gets really crowded shortly after opening. We ordered two portions of chicken The Korean Fried and the spicy one. The classical one was pretty bland and slightly underwhelming, although the crisp was very nice. For the spicy one it just did not our taste, while it was not bad. The sides were pretty good and delicious. We got 2 portions of fried chicken with 2 portions of rice and not hungry afterwards. Solid fried Korean chicken. The spicy is extremely not spicy at all, so Id recommend getting the extra spicy sauce. Im a Caucasian from New York whom loves fried chicken and enjoys medium level spiciness and the mild was literally nothing. But staff was friendly and Id def come back next time Im in the mood for some Korean in Paris. The food was good, the staff were nice, and the atmosphere was amazing.
As many people were talking, it was noisy but yk in a good way, it's perfect to go with your friends.
But it's quite expensive. food came pretty fast and it was very very good. chicken was tender and crispy and the sauce was really good. would def come again! we just ordered 3 menus and it was enough for the three of us.","Monday: 12:00 – 3:00 PM, 7:00 – 10:30 PM

They had a lot of bay marine stuff that was reheated if you wanted but we decided on the pho and have to say the pho was pretty good. Broth was light and noodles and beef were good. Didnt try anything on the bay marine just the pho Very good and affordable. Quick service and generous portions! Worst experience in Paris. Were huge Ph fans and this one was the worst we ever eat. Plus staff really loudly moving chairs around as if we were not present. Really rude and disgusting food. This is an amazing place for the price. Ive been eating here at least once a week for a year, and always having their signature Pho soup. Its a great value for money, consistent and comfort food for my soul.

The advantage of being able to eat food that could only be ordered and eaten at 'The Kimchi Shop'  Thanks to the friendly and cheerful owner, I had a delicious and comfortable meal!

I would love to have a highchair for kids too but they may not have kids guests a lot, we always had a good place for our stroller anyway. But I hope they will equip highchair in the future. Dokkebbi is one of the best Korean restaurants in Paris I have been to.
The owner are super nice, the menu changes regularly and there are options for vegetarians and other dietary options. Small place, super sweet and attentive staff all trying to speak Korean or even speaking it well. The banchan are served in individual ramekins and are okay, the kimchi is lacking in the true pungent flavor, but everything tastes fresh.

We are Koreans visiting from the states and the feel in the place is like a little boonshik place, but the prices are def on the pricier restaurant side 1425euros per plate. We had a few solid staples which were all pretty good.

Nothing amazing, just a solid representation and a sampling of korean food they even have gujulpan which is rare to find. See pics of the individual banchan, kimchi fried rice and the mandoo. My youngest wanted jajangmyun  the pork served in it is pork belly which is not authentic, but super tasty. The sauce could be more watery and less pasty, but all in all, we were satisfied. The owner is super friendly and makes sure you feel comfortable  food is really yummy too, authentic Korean food! Some of the most authentic Korean Ive had in Paris.

I asked the waiter if the chef could make me something, and he suggested a veggie dish. I was pleasantly surprised by what he had prepared. It was delicious! My husband tried the mashed potatoes that were on my plate and went ga ga for them. He told the waiter they were excellent and about 5 mins later, the chef had sent out a bowl of them for my husband! The apple tart was amazing! Great experience! We were a bit intimidated at first since this was the first restaurant we came to in Paris. A small restaurant with a lot of character. We soon felt right at ease and like we found a neighborhood gem. We started with the morel mushrooms and wow they were tasty. Wine was also good. I ordered the beef burignon with pasta and my husband got the confit duck. Both dishes were super delicious and filling. We had to end our meal with their famous grand marnier souffl, it is massive and delicious. They ended it all off with a fabulous tray of treats with an almond twill that was wonderful. Espresso was also great. Very authentic French taste. Foie gras pate very rich and smooth. Tomato salad fresh and sauce well mixed. Beef tartar portion big and tasty, restaurant manager prepared it nicely on table, everything perfect! The menu price looks expensive vs environment but it is very high quality food. Highly recommend and will visit and do dinner with a bottle of wine next time! A traditional place. Delicious food and fast, kind service. Feels like half locals and half tourists because of its mention on Eater. Had incredible langoustines and duck leg confit. This restaurant is one of those quintessential institutions in Paris, famous for its Boeuf Bourguignon. We chose to go for lunch to take advantage of the broader menu and ordered a variety of dishes.
We started with the steak tartare, which was simply divine. It was freshly prepared right in front of us, allowing us to customize the seasoning to our preference, whether mild or spicy. Next, we tried the fried foie de canard, which was incredibly juicy and rich, perfectly complemented by their sweet dipping sauce.
For the main course, we naturally opted for the Boeuf Bourguignon. The flavor and cooking were impeccable, but I found the tagliatelle side dish a bit disappointing. It was slightly overcooked and cut into smaller pieces, which detracted from the overall experience.
We made sure to save room for the renowned desserts the oversized millefeuille and the superpuffed souffl. The millefeuille was exceptionally crispy, with a luscious vanilla cream that was absolutely addictive. Unfortunately, the souffl fell short of expectations it was runny inside and had an overpowering egg aftertaste, which I tried to mask with the Grand Marnier provided.
Overall, the food was very good, especially when paired with the excellent wine selection. Despite a few minor disappointments, this restaurant remains a noteworthy addition to the list of mustvisit places in Paris.","Monday: 12:30 – 2:30 PM, 7:30 – 10:00 PM

We chose to sit inside as the patio was full and we love the interiors! Full of art and quirky bits and bobs. The duck was great, the melon salad SOO GOOD, with affordable wines and great olives. You must make a reservation! This place fills up quickly and most everyone has a reservation. We walked up on Saturday to make a reservation for Tuesday. We were seated promptly at our reserved time. Its extremely busy and fast paced. The ratatouille was delicious, my steak was not overcooked, and very tender. The ravioli was too rich, my fianc could barely eat it. Theres no English menu so do your research before showing up. The chocolat mousse is worth the hype  you must get it if you go. The food is really good. The ravioli and the mussels were exceptional, I would visit again just for these. The mousse is not overrated, it really is good. I wouldn't give them a five star because we didn't like the way we were treated by the blonde lady while being in the waiting list. it took us two hours to be seated.
Tip they don't have online reservation. You can call them in advance to reserve. Super cool place!! I guess we were a bit late for the lunchtime and couldnt get the dish of the day. The chocolate mousse was so good! I had La Flottante and ratatouille. Both were very delicious, but I think ratatouille was my favorite, probably because I love eggplant. The olives served at the table before the meal were amazing. Despite the crowd and how busy it was, the waiter did their best to be attentive and even made some recommendations.

Thank you for the lovely meal.

The only thing that bothered me was being seated at the table near the entrance, as it was quite cold and I felt a bit chilly. However, since I was dining alone and didnt have a reservation, its not something I can really complain about","Monday: 8:00 AM – 2:00 AM

We were absolutely pleased with both the service and the food at this charming family restaurant. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the staff made sure everything was perfect. The food was delicious, fresh, and served with care. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a great dining experience!

However, we were quite shocked to witness a group of six Americans asking for a discount in exchange for a recommendation. Such behavior was surprising and out of place, but it didnt take away from the restaurants wonderful quality.

Well definitely be back! Wonderful evening and dining experience. Three of us reserved for dinner and were not disappointed. All chose the 55 euro prix fixe, only 3 or 4 options for each course but a nice range of choices. All our courses were delicious, pictures are of escargot, fish entree, and two dessertscream brle and chocolate cake.
Feels like a family run spot with the two brothers taking care of us and very accommodating with our questions and requests. Nice selection of reasonably priced wine bottles as well. Best to make reservations as its a smallish spot.
Definitely recommend!! Amazing French onion soup! The duck was cooked and flavored very well! Our server was super nice, let us try the wines before ordering a glass. Brought us a thing of olive oil  butter for our bread upon request. Olive oil was so good! A nice little bistro just outside of the hustle and bustle focused on duck recipes, and also traditional favourites like escargot, onion soup, and beef.
Quaint, cozy bistro serving traditional French food  and wine. Very enjoyable. One of my best experiences in Paris hands down. Onion soup was so tasty and delicious then moving onto tournedos rossini which I think is top 3 steaks Ive ever had in my life. Not only the food but also the service was amazing I love how respectful and polite they are with all of their costumers.

Built in 1900 and still going strong, this glass domed structure clearly catches the eye, as it is a stand out feature. Seen from across the river at the Northern end of Alexander III bridge it proivides a huge photo opportunity. Stunning building with glass rooftop. Venue for Fencing competition at Paris Olympics 2024. This place is accessible from inside only during events. The Grand Palais in Paris is a historic and iconic exhibition hall and museum complex located near the Champslyses and Place de la Concorde.

Built for the 1900 Exposition Universelle World's Fair, it is renowned for its impressive glassdomed roof, which is a prime example of BeauxArts architecture.

The Grand Palais hosts a wide array of events, including art exhibitions, fashion shows, and cultural events. Its grandeur and architectural beauty make it a significant landmark in Paris, attracting visitors from around the world.

The complex also houses the Galeries nationales du Grand Palais, which display major art exhibitions. The building has undergone various restorations to preserve its structural integrity and aesthetic appeal. The Grand Palais boasts stunning architecture. Its grand BeauxArts style, with its impressive glassdomed roof and ornate facade, is truly a sight to behold. Walking around the building, I was struck by its majestic presence and intricate details. The blend of stone, steel, and glass creates a beautiful harmony that reflects both classical and modern design elements. Even without entering, the exterior of the Grand Palais is a testament to Paris's architectural brilliance.",no operation time,"museum, tourist_attraction, art_gallery, point_of_interest, establishment"

We took the stairs, and it wasn't as bad as you'd think, as you're distracted by many hidden glimpses of the view you'll embrace at the top.

There were also food and restaurant facilities available. We were especially impressed by an incredible machine that gave you 2 when you recycled your cups. It's a testament to how environmentally driven France is  they really do encourage being environmentally friendly!

And rightly so! The views were breathtaking, and you really get to appreciate Paris from a whole new perspective.

If you're a photographer, you have some real opportunities with the right eye!

I love Paris, and this was a highlight of our trip! This was a amazing experience. The structure itself is impressive in size and the design of the ironwork. The Eiffel Tower must be on the list of places to visit in Paris.
The views are 360 degrees and  stunning. The elevators hold 45 people  per car, but it is not overcrowded and the cars have large windows. The cafe on the second level makes a pretty good hot chocolate. The ham and cheese on a baguette was also tasty. I was blown away by my visit to the Eiffel Tower. I had seen pictures of it my entire life, but nothing could prepare me for the experience of actually being there! It was SO much cooler than I ever imagined beforehand. Just seeing it, a marvel of architecture and history, gave a feeling of deep appreciation and awe I can't fully describe. I climbed up the stairs to the observation platform midway up the tower. There were a LOT of stairs it was a semidifficult climb. But the views were so worth it. I spent over an hour looking out over Paris in all directions. There were countless things to see in 360 degrees! If you're visiting Paris, I highly recommend taking the stairs or elevator to the observation deck you will absolutely not regret it! My experience at the Eiffel Tower was overall amazing. I felt safe while there, and the area was kept very clean. It's a wonderful and magnificent landmark! Visiting the Eiffel Tower can be both an aweinspiring and challenging experience. As you approach, youre greeted by the stunning view of this iconic structure rising above the Paris skyline. However, the area around the tower is often crowded with tourists, street vendors, and performers, creating a busy, lively atmosphere.

The line to enter the tower can be quite long, especially during the weekend. Waiting to get through security and up to the elevators requires patience. Once inside, youre rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views of Paris, which make the wait worthwhile. Despite the crowds and the wait, standing beneath and atop the Eiffel Tower is a mustdo experience, offering an unforgettable perspective of the City of Light. 

We visited the Eiffel Tower on a Sunday and were pleasantly surprised by the lack of queues. It made the experience so much more enjoyable! We took the elevator to the summit, and the view was breathtaking, even with a bit of cloud cover. The iconic landmarks of Paris peeking through the clouds added a unique charm to our visit. Overall, a fantastic experience that I would recommend to anyone visiting the city!","Monday: 9:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Arc de Triomphe,"Pl. Charles de Gaulle, 75008 Paris, France",4.7,48.8737917,2.295027499999999,"Beautiful architecture and history. Definitely a must see when in Paris. I love how they built a passage under the road to get to the center and other side so that you do not have to cross the very busy roundabout. Makes it very easy to access. A lot of steps  13 euro ticket but it's worth it to go up! The line looks longer than it is, just 20 minutes to get through initial security and then you walk another 510. Great way to appreciate Paris with twelve major roads starring out in each direction, fantastic view of Tower and other attractions. Go just before sunset for cool photos and memorable views. There's an underground bridge, so you dont have to cut through traffic to get to it. If you want to get to the top, there's free entry for 1825 EU residents and longterm EU residents visa 4 months! If that's not you but you still want to see the views from the top, I recommend purchasing tickets in advance. The ticket line moved quickly, but it would've been much faster if we already had our tickets. Great views. Be prepared for some stairs, though!! There is also an elevator for the elderly and disabled. The history demonstrated is more important.
Try during twilight, oh you enjoy it. Wait until Eiffel tower light to come up it sis glorious

One of the must see place in Paris if you visit.

Tickets are reasonable and at this place.  No online booking recommend.  Stay in the queue and enjoy the traffic and movements around it.

Enough street parkings are available if you go by private vehicle.  Not sure about public transport and its availability. This is going to sound a little odd but the special part of the Arc is not the outside of the Arc itself, it's the interior and the stunning views you can get from the top. Try get tickets in advance for around sunset for the day you attend, providing the sky is clear you should get a great view. Be prepared to climb a lot of steps! There is a lift but is generally not available for most people. There are toilets available for those wondering. Well worth the visit if you visit Paris.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:30 PM

Louvre Museum,"75001 Paris, France",4.7,48.8606111,2.337644,"My visit to the Louvre Museum in Paris was very nice. The museum itself is a masterpiece, both in terms of its architecture and the vast collection of art. The entry might take time due to long line so better book your tickets online.

One of the most memorable moments was finally seeing the Mona Lisa. The paintings aura was next level. Surrounded by crowds, it still managed to stand out as a symbol of artistic brilliance. Watching it up close, I could appreciate the mysterious expression and delicate brushstrokes that have intrigued art lovers for centuries.

Another highlight of my visit was the stunning collection of royal ornaments. The intricate craftsmanship of the crowns, scepters, and jewels was dazzling.

The Louvres collection is vast, and its impossible to see everything in one visit. However, my experience was unforgettable, filled with iconic art, rich history, and a deep appreciation for the masterpieces housed there. For anyone visiting Paris, the Louvre is an absolute mustsee! This is without a doubt the best museum I've ever been to. I can't express how amazing it is. Floor to ceiling, wall to wall, absolutely packed to the brim with the finest art you'll ever have the privilege to see. I was overwhelmed by the size and magnitude of this place.

Do yourself a favor by grabbing a map and don't be in a hurry. You could easily spend all day inside. And definitely wear comfy shoes! There's tons of ground to cover and lots of stairs.

Buy tickets in advance!

We bought tickets for 10am entry and the crowds weren't too bad. By the time we left, around 2pm, the place was packed. O.o A very large and awesome place to visit with unique items from all over the world. I highly recommend advance ticket purchase and guided tour is the perfect choice. It's very busy and I found it unorganized. You'd need one full day, if you don't have a guided tour. This massive museum is almost impossible to take in during one visit. The hours I spent there were overwhelming in the best way, trying to drink in thousands of years of human history, ability,  and creativity. A must see, and an experience of a lifetime! Make sure to buy your tickets in advance and arrive 15 minutes before your entry time. They have strict security measures. It is crowded with tourists. There are food kiosks, restaurants and souvenir shops inside. Wear your most comfortable shoes as you will do a lot of walking to see the whole museum.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

Domaine National du Palais-Royal,"75001 Paris, France",4.6,48.8637569,2.3371261,"Domaine National du PalaisRoyal is an absolutely beautiful place to visit in Paris! The gardens and architecture are stunning, offering a peaceful retreat right in the heart of the city. Best of all, its free to enter, making it a perfect spot for anyone looking to enjoy some of Pariss charm without spending a dime.

The entire area is incredibly photogenic, with elegant columns, manicured gardens, and lovely fountains that create a picturesque setting. Its a great place for a leisurely stroll, taking photos, or just sitting on a bench and soaking in the atmosphere.

For travelers planning a visit, I recommend going early in the morning or late in the afternoon to enjoy the serenity of the gardens before they get too busy. If youre into photography, youll find plenty of opportunities for beautiful shots, especially with the iconic black and white columns in the courtyard. Also, take some time to explore the surrounding area, as there are plenty of charming cafes and boutiques nearby.

Overall, Domaine National du PalaisRoyal is a mustvisit when in Parisits a hidden gem that offers a perfect blend of history, beauty, and tranquility. Dont miss it! What a great place to relax on the middle of a busy Paris. Gardens are stunning and its not too busy. Free to enter and just hang out. The fountains are a tribute to Champagne because thats where it was first made public by the Monk Dom Perignon. Simply spectacular and within easy walking distance of numerous iconic ""must see"" places in Paris.  The spacious and well kept grounds are a real treat where you can relax or browse and take in the atmosphere at your leisure.  Definitely well worth the visit.  No cost to enter.  Take the obligatory photo as a momento of your visit. This is one of my favourite spots in Paris, without a doubt. The elegant beauty, history and exquisite refinement of this place always recharges me. I love reading the thoughtful quotes written on the benches and chairs and just spending time in contemplation and gratitude. An oasis of enriching tranquility in the heart of the most beautiful city in the world. Pretty location for photos and relaxation. Lots of chairs available in the garden and plants are well managed.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 10:30 PM

Panthéon,"Pl. du Panthéon, 75005 Paris, France",4.6,48.8462218,2.3464138,"When youre nearby, your heart stops at the grandeur of the surrounding structures. This area is a mustvisit, even if just to admire from the outside. We didnt manage to go inside the Pantheon as we hadnt planned ahead, and the line of tourists waiting to buy tickets was very long. So its best to purchase tickets in advance. I guess I went in with lower expectations because this surprisingly ended up being one of the coolest landmarks we went to in Paris. Definitely get the panoramic ticket, even if the weather isn't nice. We should've bought tickets in advance but the wait and cost was worth it. Such a spectacular monument. Photos do not prepare nor do justice for this amazing piece of architecture and history.
If youre in Paris, you MUST come inside and take a walk through this Pantheon, its honestly one of the best in Europe. There are multiple lines for entry, we did not have tickets but did not want to wait in the line for people who have not booked but managed to book online within 5 minutes so managed to skip that larger queue. Once in its quite a stunning building, amazingly detailed sculptures in a space that reminds me a little of something from Rome. The lower crypt is added bonus even if on the more eery side. For me its a great place but possibly a little too highly priced compared to museums which have a bit more to look at. You might spend up to an hour hear depending on your pace. This whole area is absolutely stunning. I've never seen this much stone in my life. We did not opt to go inside due to a limited amount of time in Paris and wanted to see as much as we could. U can go inside for a small fee. I imagine the view is spectacular from inside. There is a view of the Eiffel tower from the street in front.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:30 PM

My favorite are was the place where Marie Antoinette was jailed.  I loved seeing the personal items that belonged to her.  Her little shoe was precious! A palace that turned into a prison for the French royalty, and now its a must visit monument. You get a tablet that gives you a virtual tour inside, and you can see how things were during the 18th century. Great for kids too. Not really worth visiting. Just bare walls throughout, nothing of interest. You must have great imagination to take it in, otherwise you will see nothing but dull chambers, and even the AR tablet you receive at the entrance wont help much.

During my visit the tablets were limited to one per couple, even though the day was rainy and far from busy, and there were tons of spare tablets available. The lady at the ticket desk refused outright to give one more tablet regardless. Shameful. It was a short visit. For me, the cell of Marie Antonette was the only thing here that warranted my attention. They had some art display or exhibition going on in the main hall that I breezed right through. It seemed like an afterthought to help sell tickets as the rest of the grounds seem underwhelming. Conciergerie is very less crowded place and the complimentary tablet provided at entrance helps you understand and navigate the history behind this place. Very nice and interactive tablet explained the original place in a time travel format I really liked this innovation. Do visit this place to learn about an important historic place of Paris. Don't forget to check out the prison guard's office and cells.

When I was there, there weren't a lot of bathrooms available, so keep that in mind before you go. The park is incredible with lots of big trees and cool nature sights to see. You won't regret a visit! Beautiful park with a nice view of the Effile Tower. Although during the Olympics it was extra crowded with some areas closed, it was still a wonderful sight to see.

There are also multiple cafes that were very busy inside the park as well. Lots of people selling tourist items, some musicians playing, plenty of seating. Great for a long stroll or place to hangout for a picnic! Went here to explore after coming out of the Louvre and this did not disappoint. Plenty of walking space with a variation of bonds and trees. Plenty of seating options available. It's great just to take some time out and sit by the fountains and rest your legs. Very nice relaxing park to just stroll through, the fountains have seats for you to sit and chill and just people watch. There was a family feeding bread to the ducks so there were many in one spot. It was slightly sprinkling when we went but there were still quite a lot of people. It would be even nicer on a sunny day. It doesnt allow you to bring your doggos though or ride a bike through it which is unfortunate Beautiful grounds near the Louvre. No Louvre ticket or visit is needed to stroll the garden paths. Plenty of space to sit down and relax. Great picture opportunities.

Keep in mind large portions of this area get closed down during events like the Olympics. Beautiful grounds to walk through and play in the play ground.

Beautiful trees and surrounds. Also food and drink kiosks, bring a blanket or use one of the hundred of portable chairs to find your favourite view. Nice place to eat lunch or a snack or go for a stroll. Some vendors in the parking selling snacks and drinks. The Luxembourg Palace is located in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, north of the famous Luxembourg Gardens and is the location of the French Senate.
From a historical perspective, the palace was built for the mother of King Louis XIII of France and Gaston, Duke of Orlans, Marie de Mdicis, quite close to an old palace belonging to Franois Henri de Montmorency, Duke of Luxembourg. This small palace later acquired the title it retains until today, Petit Luxembourg and is the location of the president of the French Senate. Beautifully layed out and divided into a very classic tiered garden,  with the Palace in the background.
Classical statues and famous people line the walkways shadowed by nicely trimmed square trees.
And two lions protecting the gardens and fountain.
Awesome place here!!! Located at the northern end of some very pretty parklands, the Luxembourg Palace stands out as quite the impressive building.

Dont go too close though as they armed guards get a bit antsy and they carry automatic rifles.

We sat on the benches for a while and there was an amazing busker outside singing  he was so awesome. Beautiful spot covered in the word ""love"" in various languages. Unfortunately, when I visited, it was closed, so I had to take photos from the outside. Even though I couldnt see it up close, the view from the outside still captured the essence of the place. If youre a fan of art and romance, its worth a visit on your next trip. A lovely little initiative showcasing I love you in every language around the world. Located in Montmartre, very close walking distance to the Sacre Coeur and a variety of cafes and restaurants. Found in a small park, which often has buskers out the front playing lovely acoustic music.

Busy with lovers, so get there early to get a photo. This is such a cute place! I would recommend coming early in the morning as you see it was very crowded around lunch time. It is convenient to combine it with the visit to Montmartre as it is just down the hill 
There are maaany languages, even expressions in different dialects of the same language there is Dutch but also Flemish! We stumbled upon this wall on our walk in Montmartre. Writings of ' I love u'  in languages of the world. Wonderful. No ticket needed.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 8:30 PM

Cute area to hang out. There were a lot of kids there on their lunch break. But lovely area to walk through. Beautiful garden. Statue of Louis 13 in here. Check it out. Patches of grass to enjoy. Very quiet and not busy in morning. Scene is kinda surreal. Fountains and everything so manicured Nice beautiful square and park in Marais. Lovely to get a post lunch stroll or nap.

It is allowed to walk and lay down in the nicely mowed grass. Le Marais is a must see in Paris and in its heart, La Place des Vosges.

Sit on a bench, enjoy the break and the rest, and breathe the true Paris. I still remain in awe of parks and green cover in Paris. Lovely place right next to Maison Victor Hugo, surrounded by great cafes, boutiques, galleries, bars.

I particularly liked how they made a number of bee hives and bird houses into works of art.  The ""purple"" flower section was spectacular while we were there early July. Lovely place with impressive thematic areas, like big bonsai exposition, art exposition, special gardens for different family of flowersplants, and even some birds, ducks and peacocks around. Very relaxing, well organized and beautiful place to visit and spend some time for photos, contemplation and learning about different plantsflowers. When you enter the park you won't feel that there's so much more inside. A big park with lots of flowering and non flowering plants and trees. You can easily spend half a day to full day here. Different kinds of flowers, shrubs, creepers, trees etc. which are a treat for nature lovers. Even though we visited in spring about 75 have bloomed the rest are yet to make a peek.

There are couple of restaurants and toilet facility inside the park. There are lots of benches everywhere inside the park which is a boon. The entrance fee is just 3.5 euros which you can take online through app or buy from the counter. Easily accessible by bus number 112 and 207 or by metro 1 chateau de vincennes There's some work goin on in the chateau else that's also a good option to visit. All in all you will definitely enjoy the park. Truly the most spectacular place on the edge of Paris, blooming from late February to November  seas of daffodils, cascades of Hortensia, clouds of azalea, magnificent camellia trees, and much more. The best time to visit is April and May, as featured on my photos. It's a secret place not known to tourists, offering simply enormous space integrated with nature, including ponds and sculptures. There are a few places to eat, a selection of bonsai trees in the pavilion, and peacocks roaming outdoors. Plenty of cute spots for a romantic picnic can be found throughout. There's a large playground space for kids on the further edge of the park, and in autumn, a section of large flower beds features hundreds of dahlia blooms.

Catacombs of Paris,"1 Av. du Colonel Henri Rol-Tanguy, 75014 Paris, France",4.1,48.8338325,2.3324222,"You definitely need to get the tickets in advanceonly sold one week prior to the day you require entry. And be sure to buy from the official website...I have heard there are fakes out there.
Our entry time was 1045am. We walked up at about 1040, went through the security line quickly, declined the audio tour, and started walking down the spiral staircase. They only let 200 people down at a time, and there is a digital display on the wall right before you descend, keeping track.
DO NOT underestimate the physical part of this. The stairs going up and down are not for the faint of heart. It can easily make you dizzy, and obviously, it is just a plain physical strain going up and down. Plus, the path down below is uneven, slick, and cramped. Do not go down if you're claustrophobic or over 6 foot 2 inches. My husband is that tall, and he almost hit his head in several spots and even had to tilt his head sideways while walking at times. It was a gruesome yet fascinating part of Paris to see. All in all, we spent about 30 minutes below ground. Wow what a historical part of Paris. We got the audio while walking through and it was so informative and told you so much history and information. It is just amazing how many bones and bodies make up the designs that you see. The history and the stories that you will hear and read is so interesting. We went during the Olympics and they were busy, but not too bad since we went in the morning. Would recommend during your visit to Paris. There are a lot of steps both and down and up, but they are easy to manage. First off, please buy the tickets only from the official site, no need for you to get scammed on the 3rd party websites. On there, the adult ticket can cost upwards of 90 euros, while on the official site you can get it for much, much less. Also, buying the tickets is somewhat of a must, as they sell out really quickly a lot of the time. The slots open 1 week in advance, good luck!

Second, please do not use flash from your camera, if your phone has it, use the night mode where you stand still from 1 to 10s to allow more light to enter the sensor and get some quite good results.

The audo guide is completely worth it, both me and the Miss think so. She had hers in French, and I took mine in English as I was more at ease with it. You also have a Spanish and a Germanif my memory serves me correctly version of it.

The steps up and now are not that exhausting, average physical form is enough. You have something like 120 steps both ways, though the staircase is your classical circle one, so you might get dizzy along the way if you're descending fast.

We took around 1h, but we stopped to read all the plaques, and did discuss them along the way, you would usually take around 45 to 50 minutes. Enjoy the experience, there's no need to rush it. On the walls you can see signs from time to time with a human ear and a number alongside it, that means you should listen to the section X of your audio guide if you have one.

At least in the summer 32C on the surface, the temperature was bearable and we'd classify it as ""tshirt weather"".

Overall the history behind this place is incredible, and they really cater to tourists with the multilingual signs, you won't feel left out, that's for sure! A must visit place to explore the history of Paris city. It allows a limited number of people everyday, so you have to book tickets in advance. You need to climb lots of stairs to go down. Plus this place is claustrophobic. So make sure that you are aware of these points before visiting. You can skip the audio guides as information is present on board in French and English at all the important points inside. It will take you around 40 mins to cover this place. What a memorable experience! We had the audio tour and to learn about where these bones came from and how they were moved  it is a sacred site.  131 stairs down and up which you should keep in mind but definitely worth seeing.","Monday: Closed

Place de la Bastille,"Pl. de la Bastille, 75004 Paris, France",4.3,48.8531827,2.3691443,"Wonderful open area full of historical significance. Has public seating. Many police and military on patrol for Olympics. Dont miss the picture with the Olympic rings. Place de la Bastille is rich in history and has a unique atmosphere, but my experience was somewhat dampenedperhaps due to the bad weather. Despite the clouds, its clear this square has a lot to offer with its lively surroundings and historical significance. On a sunnier day, Im sure it would be even more impressive. A solid fourstar spot to explore in Paris. Place de La Bastille is a mustvisit location in Paris, rich in history and vibrant with life. The square is not only a symbol of the French Revolution but also a hub of activity where past and present seamlessly blend. The iconic July Column stands tall in the center, offering a perfect spot for photos.

Whether you're strolling through the area or enjoying a coffee at a nearby caf, the energy of the place is contagious. The surrounding streets are full of charming shops and restaurants, making it a great spot to explore. Plus, the proximity to the beautiful Bastille Opera House adds a cultural touch to the visit.

Overall, Place de La Bastille is a perfect mix of history, culture, and modern Parisian life. I highly recommend adding it to your itinerary when visiting Paris! Still a great place to have a good time the weekend until 6am... You can even eat in multiples restaurants until 4am after partying or just visiting paris by night. Nice place de la Bastille. Some police cars n security nearby. Paris public tourist places always high security police personnel",no operation time,"tourist_attraction, landmark, point_of_interest, establishment"
Tour Saint-Jacques,"Square de la Tour Saint-Jacques, 75004 Paris, France",4.5,48.85806849999999,2.3489072,"I liked a lot the site and especially its benches, yes the benches.
When you walk Paris, you eventually get tired and you not always wish to sit at a cafe but you just want to rest and enjoy a nice view or look at a park.
This is exactly the case here and the pause facing this beautiful tower and its flowers around was more than welcome. 300 steps to climb is not for everyone but the view at the top of all Paris is amazing.  Tour guide explanation of the history is very interesting. Booking is required as limited numbers in each visit. Amazing attraction in Paris that is not known...a hidden gem!!! You can buy the ticket at the kiosk which is located inside the small square. The visit is within a nice guided tour that starts every hour having some slots in french and in english. To climb the tower you'll face 300 steps stairs, however, as it's a guided tour, the group stops 2 times on the way up to visit internal parts with nice explanations, which makes the climb softer. From the top, you have 360 degrees of breathtaking views! It more than worths the 300 steps! People were chilling there near by. It was really crowded. Some people were sun bathing there. Be careful and always look at your purse and pocket. You can chill here but this place must be crowded all the time. You can not really see much here but i bet this place is on your bucket list in Paris. A historical tower in the middle of a public park. I havent been inside but i was told it is a nice climb, and will be doing so soon. It has a lot of history and gives its surrounding neighborhood a sense of uniqueness. You can also see the gargoyles and statues just passing by it.","Monday: Closed

Sainte-Chapelle,"10 Bd du Palais, 75001 Paris, France",4.6,48.855375,2.3449609,"While the church is beautiful, they could do a much better job with crowd management. As you can see when we showed up it was impossible to tell which line was for which type of entrance. For a weekday during shoulder season, the line moved much slower than expected too. Id recommend getting tickets in advance. Wow, it was an amazing experience! I loved it. When you go inside, it's a different feeling altogether. You have to look at each line from the bottom up, as each line has a separate story to tell. You also have to go to the upper level to see the stunning glass walls. And the best part? Entry is free with the Paris Museum Pass. Be sure to keep it with you wherever you go in Paris, it comes in handy! Make sure you get timed tickets and find the right line. Not very organized.  There are seperate lines for tickets on the hor and half hour. Full airport security with the 360 scanner.

Once inside the chapel is incredible. Try to go on a sunny day to get the full effect of the stained glass. It's hard to decide where to look. The rose window was so intricate and beautiful. Well worth the small confusion to get inside I don't remember hearing about this chapel before my visit but was very glad I went. It is stunning inside. My only complaint would be I did not see an elevator. The stairs are very old stone stairs. They go around up the tower. They are not even so it's easy to trip and there are a lot. If you are unable to do stairs you would not be able to see the upstairs stained glass. I would also use the bathroom before you go.  Watch where you walk as the stones in the grounds are uneven, but it is worth it. We bought tickets in advance and still waited for an hour plus just to get in. Our reservation time was 130, we didn't get in till after 230. There are 3 lines for the queue in place. The markers are 20 feet from the checkin, and security is another 1020 feet from there, so you need to be in the middle aisle if you're at the half pass reservation. Queue on the right aisle is for the 0 hour reservation. Queue on the left is if you don't have tickets.  So getting in took a while, and once you're in, there is a bag and body check, like the airport   they check everything, including bags, camera, and phone. After you enter,  you can buy your tickets or scan your prepurchased tickets. As you go into the 1st floor of the chapel, which is also the souvenir shop, you can spend about 510 minutes there. Go up the spiral staircase on the right when you face the entrance. Cautiously go up the tight and narrow spiral stairs to the 2nd floor, and that's where the stained glass and the beautiful ceiling are located. There's a walk out to the balcony, which oversees the grounds. You exit on the left side of the balcony, looking out at the balcony. Again,  caution going down the spiral staircase.  Waiting for an hour to have a 30minute visit is not a great costbenefit tradeoff, but it's our first time to visit, and you need to bring your patience and manage your expectations. If you get the audio, you may be longer. For me,  it was worth the wait. 3 star because of the lack of logistics managing ticket  sales I believe they oversell and is probably the cause of the delay.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM

Got some really cute photos here! You can see all of Paris from the church. There are many exquisite and cute shops going down the road. A beautiful spot for you to view Paris. You can go up the funicular or use the ""John wick"" stairs. We went around lunchtime and was so busy, maybe try early morning or later in the evening.

Trocadero gardens,"Pl. du Trocadéro et du 11 Novembre, 75016 Paris, France",4.6,48.8616885,2.2892799,"Trocadro Gardens in Paris is a picturesque and iconic spot, offering breathtaking views of the Eiffel Tower. With its elegant fountains, expansive lawns, and classic architecture, its an ideal place for a leisurely stroll or a relaxing picnic. The gardens are wellmaintained, with plenty of benches and shady areas to sit and take in the beautiful surroundings. The combination of greenery and water features, particularly the stunning Fountains of Warsaw, adds to the serene ambiance. It's especially magical at sunset or in the evening when the Eiffel Tower lights up, making it a favorite among photographers and tourists alike. It was a great experience after 15 years that Ive been to venue for the first time.
The gardens are as stunning as I remember, the perfectly manicured lawns and fountains setting the stage for my longawaited reunion. But this time, it wasnt just the breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower that captivated me it was the feeling of coming back to a Paris that I had never truly left in my heart. A lot of crowds but worth it! Best time is sunset time and around nightime every hour the lights of the eiffel tower flash for 5 minutes. In the winter period it starts at 20h00 and the last one is at 23h00 I think. If you catch the metro 6 from Trocadero towards Nation, you have nice views of the Eiffel tower when crossing the bridge so I recommend taking a video. This place is just breathtaking. The atmosphere is outta this world where romance is in there. I could see couples taking photos, bridal photoshoots and just happy people all around. The view of the tower was the best. Took my dogs here from the UK and was lovely. People stopped to take photos and chat and everyone was really nice. Always bits going on here too, making it a nice atmosphere.

Downside is the amount of conshussles going on, which can be avoided with more police presence.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Fabulous 360 view of Paris being able to see nearly all the main attractions, Notre Dome, Eiffel Tower and many others. Lucky to see the lights turn on for the Eiffel Tower and the sparkles. Highly recommend an evening visit just for this. Not over crowded at the top and the lift service was good overall other than the normal wait. No real wait into the building other than security checks. Highly recommended. Super nice experience especially if you haven't been to ParisFrance before, you do gotta watch out for the tingling in your belly if you afraid of heights. But the view is so unique, impressive and breathtaking. I would definitely recommend adding this attraction to your places to go!!  This is the place to go if you want to see Paris from above , because you can see the Eiffel tower.

The virtual reality videos of how Paris evolved are stunning.  You can go even on top of the roof

Is opening amazing view.

For 2 people we paid around 40 euros

In that day was  heavy raining  I have not thought about the possibility of seeing the Tour Eiffel from above but The Montparnasse Tower proved me wrong. Ticket cost 15.32 each and would recommend be there at least 10min before your time. If you are looking to see Paris from above and all the city then this is the place to go. Loved the experience, really do and I just wish they have a mechanical cover that allows to open up the roof and close it when it rains.

I would recommend A beautiful experience. You get to see the birds eye view of the city from the observatory on the 56th floor. Make sure to get a timed ticket close to the sunset to enjoy stunning 360 degree views.

파리 힐링 민박 (Paris Healing),"14 Bd de Magenta, 75010 Paris, France",4.8,48.8697212,2.3622423,"
I stayed at Healing Minbak for 5 days and 4 nights starting February 3rd! It was my first time traveling to Europe, and before Paris, I stayed at a Korean bed and breakfast in London, so I don't have much experience with Korean bed and breakfasts, but I will try to explain as much as I can to help firsttimers like me make a choice.
First of all, the location of the accommodation is very good. Both North Station and East Station can be reached in about 15 minutes on foot, so it is very convenient for coming from other countries or going out to nearby areas. Also, a large subway station called Relublic is less than 10 minutes away, and if you take Line 8 from here, you can go to most tourist attractions. It's great to be able to! Thanks to this, I never had to worry about transportation when planning my day's travel and was always able to travel smoothly. And since the Marais district is within walking distance 1520 minutes on foot?, it was convenient for shopping and walking around.
Second, the food is delicious. Basically, they provide side dishes such as kimchi and scrambled eggs, as well as different main side dishes for breakfast and dinner every day. Bibimbap, spaghetti, seaweed soup, fried rice, Vienna stirfry, etc. are all very delicious. Since eating out is expensive in Paris, it's really great to be able to eat breakfast and dinner at your accommodation. Moreover, the owners do all the washing up...  And the owners wait for you even if you oversleep in the morning, survey demand for dinner every day, and even if you come in a little later than the designated time, they prepare the same meal for you if you want to eat... It's the best!
Third is security! It was really safe to walk around at night, and the accommodation itself is tripleequipped, and the owners don't leave often and watch over the house, so you don't have to worry! I also brought a bicycle lock because I heard there might be thieves in the accommodation sometimes, but it was of no use.
Lastly, the bosses are very nice. When you travel, many things like this will happen, and whenever that happens, you will stop by and complain to the boss who is taking a break, but he will listen and take good care of you. But don't ever overdo it! These are the people who literally provide an environment for healing. They were so kind that we laughed the entire time we stayed at the accommodation.
In addition, towels are provided every day, hot water works well, and the water pressure is strong... there are many advantages! There were some reviews that were not satisfied with the facilities, but I think this is the best in Paris and among Korean guesthouses. I rested well and enjoyed myself for 5 days. I often go to London, Milan, and Paris, so I often stay at Airbnb or Korean BBs, and this was by far the best place I stayed in Paris!
I tend to read reviews carefully and search blogs and other places to compare trustworthy reviews before making a decision. After the owner of this place changed, the reviews were surprisingly good, so I trusted them and decided to trust them. Thanks to the reviews, I was able to stay in such a great place, so I'd like to ask for my review. I'm leaving a review in case it helps others!

First of all, the most important things I consider when staying at an accommodation are 1. Are the toilets and bathrooms clean, and is it inconvenient to use hot water?
2. Isn't it difficult to communicate with the owner during your stay? Even though I paid my own money to stay there, strangely, there were times when I ended up being criticized if I couldn't meet the owner or staff at a Korean guesthouse with good people.
3. Is the accommodation safe?
I focus on these three things the most, and if you have the same standards as me, I recommend them.
1. Not only the toilet and bathroom, but also the sink and dining table in the room, daily water cups and dishes, water purifier, slipper bed, and towels were always kept clean, so it was very comfortable to use! The accommodation was almost full during my stay, but I had no trouble using the bathroom and toilet at all! The buildings themselves are very old in Paris, so there were some things that bothered me when I stayed at other Korean bed and breakfasts, but this one didn't bother me at all. The bathroom and shower area were always neat and clean, with no scale, mold, or rust! And even if someone washed it right after using it, I didn't have to worry about the hot water and water pressure. It was convenient because there was a hair dryer!
2. The response to KakaoTalk messages was very quick from the time I confirmed my reservation, and even when I had to change my checkin time and when I got off at the North Station late and was a little scared and wanted to ask how to get there because of the strike, they always responded quickly! During my stay, they always communicated with me about how the day was, information about the strike, information about transportation, and restaurants and cafes. I felt unwell due to a cold, so I asked what kind of medicine I could buy, and I was wondering if any of the guests were sick. They said they would prepare Korean cold medicine and provided it to me whenever I needed it. One day, I suddenly came home a little late, so they asked me about dinner and prepared it for me. I told them that I was a sensitive sleeper and had trouble sleeping due to the sound of snoring when the dormitory was full, and they continued that day. They brought us a plug and prepared it for us they gave us a good one so we had a good night's sleep that day haha, and we were happy to check out and store our luggage...! I was always able to stay at ease thanks to the attentive consideration of really warm people.
3. The entrance to the building had double security, there was a supermarket downstairs, and there was a major road and station nearby, so the way home wasn't scary at all. It was very convenient because it was so close to the Marais district, and the station was right in front, so it was also very convenient! I arrived in Paris late at night during the strike and had to walk, but I was able to walk without any difficulty at all! Of course, now that the strike is over, I think I can take the subway and come directly to the front more conveniently.
I really recommend it! They always prepare a warm meal early in the morning, they always prepare a different menu for dinner, and the two of you take great care in meal preparation, so we always eat with satisfaction and rest comfortably! I think I'll be coming to Paris again soon, and I don't think I'll stay here without hesitation even then! I will come again. Thank you, boss! The reason why my first solo trip was successful was because I was able to rest comfortably and eat delicious food at the accommodation! I was able to eat delicious food for breakfast and dinner and walk around comfortably. I was happy while staying here and I was really grateful to the owner and his wife!!! I was worried because I was alone, but the owners made my stay so comfortable that I met some nice people and was grateful. I will stay here again next time I go to Paris! Thank you so much! Seeing is better than hearing, so I think it's better to go and see for yourself rather than judging by reading hundreds of reviews! The cost of eating out in Paris was very expensive. Healing BB provided breakfast and dinner twice, but you didn't have to pay extra, and the quality of the food wasn't poor. It was nice to be able to save money on food and do other things I wanted with that money.

The first atmosphere of the accommodation was quiet, so I thought I wouldn't be able to talk to the people I was staying with, but it started a conversation, and we had a lot of fun talking about each other's stories, travel stories, etc. every day!

The location of the accommodation was very close to the subway station, so I didn't feel there was a problem with security.

Conclusion Good value and good taste Facilities, service, location, and meals were all good.

1. Facilities
I stayed in an 8person dorm for 2 nights and a single room for 2 nights, and both rooms were okay. It was nice that there was a sink in the dormitory so I could easily wash my hands or brush my teeth. The single room was nice because the bed was very big and soft.

2. Service
The owner and his wife were both really friendly! He recommended good restaurants, helped me carry my luggage, talked with me while I ate, and gave me various travel tips.

3. Location
All famous stores such as ofr, merci, and vintage shops were all within walking distance, and it was nice that there were many art museums nearby, including the Pompidou. There were two subway stations nearby, but because of the strike, I couldn't use them as much as I thought, which was disappointing. It has been operating normally since the day before I checked out, so... If you go when there is no strike, you will be able to use the subway station really comfortably.

4. Meal
Breakfast was served at 8 o'clock and dinner was served at 7 o'clock, and everything was delicious! The kimchi that I made myself was really delicious, and all the menu items, including spaghetti, steak, stirfried pork, and bibimbap, were all delicious It was nice to have purified water.

If I had to pick one thing that was disappointing, it would be that the soundproofing wasn't very good... This is a problem that applies to all European apartments, so I thought that would be the case.

It was nice to be able to stay comfortably for 5 days. Recommended!!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
La Villette,"211 Av.

It took me around 12 minutes to walk through from end to end. For a unique playground, go to the dragonthemed one with a gigantic slide. Excellent concert with Rod Stewart, but was disappointed with the crowd who never really got ""Into the groove "" and only rose from their seats for a couple of songs. Kinda ruined the atmosphere, but not for me,!!  I never sat down once!! Very nice parc with lots of things around! We attend the Club de France for the Paralympics and it was awesome Highly recommend this park!  I went and spend 3 hours and had an amazing time just walking around and exploring.  I didn't have to spend a single dollar but I am sure there are plenty of things that you can do there as well that cost money.  I was out for a cheap day though and was very compensated. Great museum for young and old just wear cool clothing in the summer months cause there is no AC.

Statue of Louis XIV,"Pl. des Victoires, 75001 Paris, France",4.5,48.8657591,2.341196,"Located in the place of the same name, that was created to honour the Sun God,King Louis XIV, is his Equestrian Monument, The square is surrounded by grand and beautiful buildings, a frame to the picture so to speak. Louis XIV de Bourbon was the eldest son of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria.  He was also called Louis the Great or Sun King.  Louis le grand, louis roi soleil The Statue of Louis XIV refers to various statues depicting King Louis XIV of France, who reigned from 1643 to 1715. Louis XIV is often referred to as the ""Sun King"" due to his association with the sun as a symbol of his reign and power.

One of the most famous statues of Louis XIV is the equestrian statue located at Place des Victoires in Paris. Created by the sculptor Franois Girardon and erected in 1686, this statue portrays Louis XIV mounted on a horse, showcasing his grandeur and authority.

Another notable statue of Louis XIV can be found at the Palace of Versailles in the Hall of Mirrors. This statue, created by the sculptor JeanBaptiste Tuby, portrays the king in a standing position, wearing regal attire and holding a scepter, symbolizing his royal power.

These statues, along with others found in various locations, serve as reminders of Louis XIV's significant role in French history. They depict his influence and achievements as one of the most powerful monarchs of his time and his contribution to the arts and culture during the period of the French Baroque.

The statues of Louis XIV also reflect the magnificence and opulence associated with his reign, showcasing his desire to project an image of grandeur and authority. They serve as historical and artistic landmarks, allowing us to appreciate and learn from the legacy of this influential monarch. whilst here, Please do not miss the fantastic bakery just around the corner

Seeing it being reconstructed after the fire was incredible and the boards they have erected around the road side of the Cathedral was very interesting to read and see the progress so far. The spire reconstruction including the wood and craftsmanship used was good to see. I cant wait to come back when its all done and open again. Wonderful cathedral with a rich history that is under renovation and rejuvenation now because of a massive fire that broke out in 2019. I went anyway because I wanted to take a look at it now, but happy to know that it will be reopened December 2024. Look out for the lovely music from street buskers, little shops along the cathedral and a photographer who takes photos of you and prints it into a newspaperlike feature that's a lovely souvenir. You pay as you like, and can don't pay too, but I paid 5 and got 34 shots. Lovely around Notre Dame! A Timeless Beauty, Even During Renovation
The NotreDame Cathedral in Paris remains one of the most enchanting and impressive landmarks, even though it is currently closed for renovations following the fire in 2019. The cathedrals stunning Gothic architecture and intricate details continue to captivate visitors from the outside, making it a worthwhile sight to behold.

Visiting this iconic site allows you to feel the history and charm of Paris. While entry to the interior is not possible, tourists can still enjoy the views and take photos from the surrounding areas, which remain vibrant and lively, reflecting the enduring spirit of this historic landmark. This is such a beautiful Cathedral, but it still under reconstruction after the fire.

This is one of the most iconic monuments in France and it will be reopening on 2025

We just have the opportunity to see it from the bleachers and walk around, but we will define you come back after the construction is done  I visited while the reconstruction was still going on. The building itself is a masterpiece of architecture. The Gothic style just adds to the overall feeling of awe you get when you stand in front of it.

The cathedral is situated on the bank of  river Seine.

Lots of people were walking and enjoying the grounds. There was a musician entertaining people

The line up to enter the cathedral was short at the time and we went in.

The admission was free.

The experience was amazing.

There is a display describing the history of the building of this huge cathedral which took over 100 years to build. This was very informative and interesting.

There is a small gift shop inside the cathedral. Beautiful location in Paris nearby Notre Dame. Truly a once in a lifetime trip. The best way to see the city is walking, so that was difficult being in my 50's, but not too shabby as we walked an average 7 miles a day. Other ways to see the city, if course, by bus and boat tours. Gorgeous days and lovely city location. The area is historically significant but be careful of pick pockets in and around Notre Dame. We observed a young group being chased by the police away from the area and they would be the people that youd least expect !! I like the view from the back of the church and the garden down the side through the gates is far less busy and more relaxing to people watch  It is a very interesting and beautiful park near the Notre Dame!! Everything is good, many trees, cafes, restaurants.... the Notre Dame is wonderful, with unforgettable atmosphere!!! We were there, when the church service was conducted, it was very interesting too!! As the sun was shining we took advantage of sitting in the sun for a while, we pottered around for a while then went into NotreDame. The area was very busy but clean. I didnt see any rubbish anywhere which was amazing for all the people that were there.the river runs along the side of it which, is so lovely. There are numerous statues, rose windows  flying buttresses. The gothic stTue of the virgin stands in the centre of the square.","Monday: Open 24 hours

La Fontaine du GrosCaillou is a historic fountain located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, France. It is situated in the square of the same name, Place du GrosCaillou.

The design of the fountain is simple yet elegant. It features a circular basin with a central column topped by a decorative urn. Water flows from the urn into the basin, creating a soothing sound and adding to the overall ambiance of the square.

The Fontaine du GrosCaillou has undergone several restorations over the years to preserve its historical significance. It continues to serve as a gathering place for locals and a spot for tourists to relax and take in the surroundings.

The owner was a sommelier, so it was a fun time being able to briefly explain the wine and drink wine with the guests 

It was a happy trip as it was quiet and close to the subway, making it easy to get around. I will visit again next time I go to Paris!!! Really, this place was so good! Paris is not only costeffective, but also very convenient for a tourist destination, and not too touristy, but quiet and safe. Thanks to the owner, I also tasted a lot of French wine My next trip to Paris will also be here!! It's been a while since I went to Paris
Thanks to the owner's food, I was able to have a good time.
There are three shower rooms, so I used them with my friend without any inconvenience.
It was very nice, especially since it had a filter.
I was able to travel with a plan thanks to the detailed travel tips.
I rested well, ate well, and had a good time.
Next time, I will take a long vacation and go play again!
Please give me delicious food and information even then
Thank you so much I made a reservation for 6 nights, but ran out after 2 nights.

When we protested because it was a bed and breakfast that was completely different from the photos,
That's the room what if the room location is the same?
Just looking at it, it looks like theyre going to have a hazing ceremony in Paris. I feel like Im going to get pickpocketed.
They are new here and dont know anything about Paris. Italian bed and breakfasts are licensed and are at the same level as hotels, while ours is operating illegally. You guys came from the hotel. If you get a permit here in Paris, you wont be able to survive because of the coronavirus. He said blah blah blah and said of course that it was an illegal business.

After complaining for two days, they said I would get a full refund.
My Real Trip said they could only give me half, so I still can't get a refund..
I knew this would happen and recorded it all, so please dont say anything else

Note
No shower after 12pm. No shower after 12pm.
Personal shower supplies and towels not provided.
A unisex bathroom for more than 10 people,
A narrow bathroom with a strong foul smell,
broken sink,
A nearby coin laundromat costs 4 euros, but laundry costs 5 euros.
The owner often asks guests to check in,
Even though it is a women's room, they ask that the door be always open except when changing clothes to ensure ventilation.
And even on the day of checkin, the male boss was going in and out of the women's room, nagging her, telling her not to lie upside down in the direction of the bed, and telling her to use the bed next to him instead of that bed, etc.
Use only one glass of water a day,
Carelessly throwing away guest luggage the cleaning lady in the other room said she thought it was trash, but no matter where I looked, it wasn't the case

There is a lot to say, etc.
The good reviews you saw were from before the owner changed, so dont be fooled.

If you're booking for more than 2 people, get a real Airbnb.
For the price of two people, you can get a studio apartment in the city center. That's much better. Transportation costs to and from Paris are also expensive

For your information, if you say something unpleasant, they say they expect the same level as a hotel, but if the hotel does this, you should sue 
I never wanted a hotel level, I just wanted a room like the picture. lol

They unilaterally insisted on upgrading, saying that the bunk bed in the picture was changed to a first bunk bed, so it was better.. Yes, I have nothing to say.

 For those of you who read the review later, we would like to inform you that you ultimately received a refund. I stayed in early July and immediately requested a refund on the second day of my stay. They kept saying they could only give me half the amount for the remaining period, so I got a refund in August.  I still remember how stressed I was for a month.

 And the review is a review written before I received a refund, and I still have a message from My Real Trip that said they would only give me half of it, right? The date was updated when the review was edited, but it makes people look weird, as if they did it even after receiving a refund. My Real Trip also admitted that the room was very different from the picture, but they still treat me like I'm someone who threatens them with a review if I say anything negative. You will find out if you check the review of Mindana My Real Trip. If you gossip about a customer and leave a bad review, Are you asking for money by leaving a bad review? is unconditional.  Where is the lie in this review? It's all true. If the review with the facts is a bad review, is this not a bad accommodation? Please note that this is malicious. It's not evil Not even one star is worth it...

The owner says they are all tsunderes...
Is it a tsundere to disguise your rudeness as cheerfulness?

Even though they spoke informally from the first day, I was assigned a different room than in the picture and complained, and they said they gave me a better room because it was under construction, and they said it was because you don't know Paris and that you are just expecting hotel conditions haha and blamed us.

The faucet was broken and it came off when I touched it. I called a repairman two months ago, calmly telling him to put it back in, but he still hasn't come. It was painful to hear this nonsense.

And if you don't have anything, are you proud of having a fan in your room in the 30degree Celsius summer in Paris?
Air conditioners aren't often installed in Paris, so even if you don't have one, it's hard to buy a fan in Paris, so when I heard you bragging that you bought it by opening it in the early morning, I was wondering who knows.

Even if it's your first time in Paris, you shouldn't say anything like that.

It's not a hotel, but it's not even half as good as half of the other guesthouses, so only those who really don't think they can travel without this price should come.
Please note that Korean food is not provided for free and you have to pay 10 euros per meal.

If it were me, I would spend about 20,00030,000 won more and go to another bed and breakfast or Airbnb.

The bathroom has a strong odor and there are a lot of spiders, flies, and moths.
And since it's an illegally operated bed and breakfast in a roadside commercial area, you can clearly hear the sounds of cars and motorcycles passing by at night. Even the glare from motorcycles hurts my eyes.

 I saw your reply and I was shocked haha.
I didn't mention anything about refunds above, so why should I give a full refund? haha.
And when did we ask for a refund for the two days we stayed? I asked for a refund for everything except that, and they asked me to contact the app I used to make a reservation for, so I came to Korea and inquired with My Real Trip. Then, they changed their story and told My Real Trip that they would only refund half of the amount excluding the two days we stayed, not the full amount. Haha, so I sent the recording to Marit and later received a full refund, excluding the two days I stayed, as originally promised. Who said what?

The content I wrote above will not be deleted even if you give me 100 million won, so you do not have to worry about whether I am someone who is asking for money.
Why do you say that I'm doing this on purpose to get paid for reading honest reviews? Have I ever asked for money? If you have it, please bring proof of the request for money, whether it be an email or something else. It's been a while since I wrote this review, so if money was the goal, there wouldn't have been anything lol. If you can't refute what was written above, is it okay to suddenly bring up the refund issue that wasn't even mentioned in the article and accuse people of being scammers? Do you really want to get sued?

I uploaded a screenshot of the reply you made earlier, accusing me of being a scammer looking for our money.  I wonder if you know that if you leave a comment, it's sweet.. haha",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Since it is very close to Notre Dame de Paris, Le Chtelet, Le Centre Pompidou, each of them another must, it would be a pity to miss it.

We saw an interesting exhibition detailing recent infrastructural change across Paris and the effect it has had on environmental metrics and lived experiences. I was surprised and impressed by the attention devoted to womens efforts in improving the city, as well as the influence of LGBTQIA groups in promoting equality. Very cozy Christmas atmosphere, decorations, lights and the market was good. Advise to people in charge, you shouldn't not have put up those screens!, it doesn't match the intelligent architecture of the building.",no operation time,"city_hall, tourist_attraction, local_government_office, point_of_interest, establishment"

Patrick was very informative, pleasant and a happy guide.
Thank you this was a great walk and I learnt a lot more than I ever thought we could on a 2 hour walk! Patrick did a great job of a personalized tour of the Louvre.   He was very knowledgeable, and gave us lots of great insight.  He had a great sense of humor, and made the trip fun.  Id highly recommend. We had an amazing tour with Patrick!  Hes Knowledgeable, informative and with a great sense of humour.  Highly recommend! Me and my friends had a wonderful experience with Patrick as our tour guide. He was friendly, humorous, and gave us a lot of information on the history of the artworks. Thank you, Patrick!","Monday: Open 24 hours

The Paris Pass,"Big Bus, 11 Av. de l'Opéra, 75001 Paris, France",3.8,48.8652344,2.33436,"We did this a year ago so perhaps my experience is outdated. The pass was overall fantastic although it took more work than just buying the Pass. Once we had the Pass, we still had to go online to reserve times for the Louvre and many  but not all  attractions and museums. We didn't have to reserve a time for the Arc de Triomphe, for example, and just walked right on in. If you buy the Pass it is crucial to check whether places require reservations as soon as possible. This prohibits a lot of spontaneity, since Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world and a lot of people want to do the same things. The food portion of the pass was wonderful. We visited some of the chateaux on the Pass and they were astonishing. We are already planning on returning and the Paris Pass is part of our plan when we go back. The 4 star rating instead of the 5 star rating is simply due to the complications in ensuring reservations above and beyond buying the Pass. It gets you in free as long as you make a completely separate reservation on the museum website for what day and time you will be there. We didn't have a lot of time in Paris, and I didn't research it enough ahead of time however, it was worth the cost to have access to most attractions and even breakfast at different cafes. Note you must pick up your Museum Pass at the designated pick up location before attempting to enter any museums, this includes the Louvre.
The boat ride is best at night in my opinion. You get to see the Eiffel Tower light up if you go past 9 pm. I agree with other reviewers that the pass can be pricey, however for the convenience of having skip the lines and everything included in one day package is worth it. Even if only visiting a couple sights, the pass made our visit very time efficient. Also provided us with the luxury to visit attractions that were not in our itinerary.  Most sights we visited allowed us to skip the long security lines as well. The big bus pass that was included was ultra touristy but convenient for seeing a lot in a short amount of time. All staff very friendly and the reps I dealt with through email for the pass were excellent as well. This pass is great if you only have a few days in Paris or are unsure of what you want to see or do. Lots of flexibility with the pass and includes public transport which we did not need to utilize due to the big bus being included.  Beats the hassle of prepurchasing tickets online, for specific time slots etc.... we were surprised it included the museum pass which we were debating purchasing versus the Paris pass which was a plus for us. Great for those who want to keep a flexible itinerary and small groups. This is an awesome deal, but be conscious that you will not be able to see all attractions in 2 days. The Palace of Versailles entry is included in this package, but you would have to plan a way to get there separately, and once there the passes sold DO NOT provide skip the line as advertised, because most tourists there have the same ticket.

Also, the Big Bus Tour is a great way to see everything meaningful in a 4 hour span, yet, you only get one bus day with this bundle, we paid 40 once there to get an additional day... Bottom line get there early and get a bus upgrade to see everything you'd like with sufficient time.

Tip Ask about downloading the app to schedule a time to enter the Notre Dame tour and use the WIFI provided by the bus while aboard to download maps.

You do get to take some awesome pictures from the bus!

P.S. The Eiffel tower is not included in this package. It was a great value, but some things were  off.  The Eiffel Tower open times flexed unpredictably due to 24 Olympics prep.  We were in Paris 1828 Sep 2021. The Arc de Triomphe was covered with fabric as an art exhibition and Paris Pass did not cover admission.   Also, train, bus, metro fares were not included. But we just bought books of ten MetroBus tickets at 16.94 euros per set and bought train tickets as needed. You need to make timed reservations  no cost with ParisMuseum pass on line for Louvre, Orsay, Versailles and some other attractions. Buy Paris Pass on line, then go to 11 Rue de L'Opera to pick up your museum pass and big bus ticket on day you want to activate.  Our US CDC Covid Vaccination card was accepted everywhere.  We applied for French Pass Sanitaire 2 wks before we left and did not get them until we came home. If you dont have a vaccination record, the other option is getting antigen test at local pharmacy, 25 euros, good for 72 hours.","Monday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM

Audio guides included. We went for lunch here last Friday. What a fantastic experience! The service, is immediately wonderful. We had the lovely Corentine wait on our table. So friendly. The starters of foie gras and the crabavocado were delicious. The lamb and onglet de boeuf... excellent. The truffle dauphinois, sublime. We finished with cheese and the pistachio, raspberry, cream dessert. Delicious.
We will be going back very soon. Highly recommend Amazing menu for reasonable price for Paris! Fantastic service, very cool location and the best lamb Ive ever eaten. Not to be missed! The restaurant in this Wine Museum is a hidden gem. I had the full course lunch with cheese and wine, food was fantastic paired with good wine.  Emmanuel was friendly and introduced us the various wine regions in France and their grapes. Its such an amazing experience to dine in a 14th century wine cellar, a must if you come to Paris. What an amazing experience! Unlike the more touristy wine tasting classes, Emmanuel let us choose the wines we wanted to taste from their extensive wine cellar, and even purchase them. He was so friendly, knowledgeable and patient, and his English was fantastic. Especially when you consider the myriad technical terms and wine making techniques he needed to use to answer our endless questions! Reservations were easy you just have to email they don't have it available online. Marie Elise took extra time to helped us package up our wine securely, so it could travel home in our suitcases. She was so kind, and a delight to talk with, and was able to make further wine recommendations based on our tasting. And you get to tour the museum with an audio guide. It was quirky, we learned a lot, and it winds through the ancient wine caves. Thank you so much, we had an amazing experience!","Monday: Closed

Highly recommend! This was a very good tour.  Bella was our tour guide and we loved her. She was very knowledgeable and very friendly. I recommend this tour with the skip the line and summit ticket. You will still have a wait in the security line and a small wait in the entrance line. Way way way a lot shorter time then if you had to wait in the normal line. Sometimes up to 3 hr wait. My cousin and I planned our whole trip to Paris around visiting Monets house. Thanks to Nicholas our trip was amazing!

Camping de Paris,"2 All. du Bord de l'Eau, 75016 Paris, France",4,48.8684804,2.2344769,"It was 8 years since our last visit to this site. The amenities had all been greatly improved. Toilet blocks were clean and able to deal with a full compliment of guests .The bar, shop, and restaurant was clean welcoming and airy. The food in particular the Pizzas were excellent.The children's play areas were modern and well equipped. There is no swimming pool but this doesnt detract from the site.
Most pitches are of good size with plenty of shade from the hot summer Paris days. The staff were friendly and helpful. Great location for visiting central Paris with much improved transport links including nearby trams buses and cycle paths. If it is Paris you are looking at and camping is your option you cant go far wrong. We stayed at the site for 4 nights while attending the Paralympics. Our pitch was small but perfect for what we needed, it was also quite secluded which was nice. The facilities were excellent, lots of toilets and showers and were always clean and tidy. We hired bikes on the last day which was not as expensive as we thought it was going to be. We found the all of the staff helpful and very friendly, especially the team at reception. I am sure we will be back soon. The front desk staff are great.  The toilets are mixed.  The restaurant looks good . But I'm marking down for the pitch blackness of this place at night . No food waste or dog waste recycling bin at the main recycling point.  The numbers of the pitches are so badly signposted and small you'll struggle to even see them . It's like two worlds . The front desk modern and well looked after , but the pitches an after thought and run down .

Can't argue about the location however it's a long walk to most places and the shuttle is limited time only . Uber is your main friend here . Add it to the cost .

Photos posted  are of the pitch numbers . See them ? No ? Exactly ! And of what you can see walking through at night . Nothing. An excellent campsite to stop for a visit to Paris and its surroundings. Wellmaintained pitches and services of all kinds within easy reach. Clean bathrooms and showers at all times and hot water always available. Furthermore, in addition to the shuttle service to the nearest metro and bus station, the bus stop is very close. If we really want to find a small flaw... the noise from the road which is very busy day and night for those who have a pitch in those places. Overall we had a great stay at the campsite. Staff at the reception is very friendly and helpful, the shuttlebus is very handy and the grounds are well maintained. Only point of feedback would be the level of service provided by Alexandre, one of the bar staff, who was very rude and did not provide the level of hospitality that the other staff members provided.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Tourism France Louvre,"6 Rue de l'Amiral de Coligny, 75001 Paris, France",4,48.86057659999999,2.3409938,"We went on three different trips with them, a coincidence that we ended up with the same driver all 3 times we were told they have 10 drivers.
Nicolas was amazing, very friendly and very skilled driver, specially in the madhouse streets of Paris. He provided bits of information on some of the locations we would pass by on our way to our destination and we were always picked up on time. And he speaks French, Spanish and English. I think most of their drivers speak all 3 languages.
This is actually my second time taking a trip with them. Last time it was to Mont St Michel, and it was great.
This time we went to Vigerny  Monets house, Loire Valley Castles, Mont St Michel. Totally worth it. I think next time we come over we might do Burges and Champagne.
I dont know why the bad reviews on the trips close to Paris though, all my trips were outside since those are the hardest places to get to on your own.
Just want to say if you want to see some amazing locations outside of Paris, and dont want the hassle of renting a car or trying to get there on your own, this is the place for you.
1010. Cancelled my trip last min when I personally confirmed with them over WhatsApp multiple times. It ruined my day and my plan. I cant believe how unreliable this travel agency is. I should have believed the other comments about their last min high risk cancellation. Had a great time doing the Loire Valley tour with the guide, Roland. Highly recommend  A wonderful tour. A great tour guide and many interesting timelines about French culture. We had many other stops include in the Normandy tour near the coast. A 2hour lunch and city tour and frequent breaks. Very satisfied with France Tourisme. Booked tour before going to France and arranged to be picked up from hotel then driven to coach departure location. Made it far more pleasant getting there, worth the extra cost. Our coach tour, in a luxury coach, was about an hour an half each way. Tour guide was knowledge and provided information enroute. Bilingual France, Spanish, and English. At the venue informed the group the best vantage points. Would use France Tourisme again.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:30 PM

Parisi Tour,"109 Rue Duhesme, 75018 Paris, France",4.9,48.8954148,2.3453909,"We loved our Montmartre tour with Hugo. He was friendly and provided a thorough yet relaxed tour. He was very attentive to details with historic information, tips and opportunities for photos and a private local wine and cheese tasting. We couldn't have asked for a better day and the best tour guide. Merci beaucoup! What an incredible and unforgettable experience! Our two trips allowed us to savor the beauty of Paris both by day and by night, offering a truly enchanting perspective of the city. The highlight was undoubtedly the exceptional tour in an iconic 2CV, which added an extra layer of charm to our time in this remarkable city. We had a tremendous 2 hour evening tour in a Citroen 2CV with Joey as our guide, driver, and photographer. He went out of his way to give us wonderful views with time to stop and take pictures. His photography skills were awesome! He also played some lovely Parisian music as we road along. It was the perfect way to cap our time in Paris! We booked two separate tours due to our schedule for our one day in Paris  our guides, Leopold and Alice were both INCREDIBLE. We saw more of the city than I had ever hoped to. We were able to see ALL of the big sites, get out and take photos when we wanted to, and view Paris through the eyes of locals. The routes taken between each site and the knowledge of the little areas that are off the beaten path were so delightful to experience.

Would recommend this tour to anybody  both my mother and my 9 year old son were loving every second of the trip  definitely would do this tour again knowing we would see new places and learn so many new things, too! We did the 3h sightseeing tour by car. It was a surprise for my boyfriend, so Quentin from iparistour helped me to decide which tour would be the best, as my boyfriend hadnt been in paris yet and I had been here already. He was also very helpful with other recommandations within Paris. The tour itself was perfectly organized, from pick up till drop off. We got many cool insights on paris in a very short time. Its not a cheap tour, but its a unique opportunity to explore a city and definately worth the money! Thank you!","Monday: 9:00 AM – 12:00 AM

In my opinion, I thought the sanitary conditions and management were excellent for the price, the room was comfortable, and the hot water was great! Above all, the owner was so warm and kind that I felt comfortable and happy during my stay. When I come to Paris again, I want to visit again. Bring your toiletries! The price is cheap but the location is great. The owner was also kind and nice. The bathroom is a bit disappointing, but overall I'm satisfied considering the price. If I go to Paris again, I want to visit again. I had a great stay! I don't think I'll ever go back.. The bedding looks bad and the mirror in the room is broken... haha. Maybe it's because I went before the trash from the people who stayed the night before was taken out, but it felt very dirty. It's a bed and breakfast where men and women live together, but the shower room is made of opaque glass, and there are places where sheets are not attached. There are shampoos and body washes lying around on the floor, and even the shower room door doesn't seem to close properly. They don't even provide meals. It's okay The bathroom shower booth was so cramped that even one person could fit in it. When I tried to wash it, it bumped into me. Plus, it smelled a bit too much. A foreigner on the same floor was racist and tried to open our room and come in. The second floor was very difficult to climb. Aside from the location factor, I was so skeptical that I thought I would have to pay for all of this. There was a Chinese restaurant below, so it was inconvenient to have a strong smell coming out when you open the door. As you can see, the location is 5 points. There is a supermarket 20 seconds away and a subway station 1 minute away. Nearby museums are also within walking distance. While walking, you can visit the charming alleyways of the Manet district and famous vintage shops. 10 out of 5 for the meal  The taste of your aunt's cooking is excellent  And a quick meal for dinner? The beer and wine they provide are excellent  I will give 4 points for the facilities. It is a total of 5 floors. I only brought one bag and didn't feel any inconvenience, but it may be a little inconvenient for people bringing suitcases. But it's the same wherever you go Even if you check in and check out twice, it's 5 minutes The bed mattress was great! The shower and toilet facilities are also satisfactory. Lastly, aunt! I give it 100 points  He was so kind and cool, cleaned up the place cleanly, told me to eat even if it was late, and even complimented me and said nice things. It was the best.

She worked with us to create an itinerary based on our interests and travel style and when we had an unexpected change 8 weeks beforehand, no problem  she helped us with revisions.  We did some sightseeing, wine tasting and bike riding and had a wonderful time.  I will be recommending Paris Toujours to everyone traveling in France. Words are inadequate to express our gratitude to Laurence for arranging the 10day honeymoon of our dreams in Paris and Alsace.  She created a unique itinerary for us based on our personalities and interests.  From private walking tours to guided visits to the most important cultural sites in Paris, everything was incredible.  We had a variety of cheese and wine tasting adventures along with a macaron baking class and horseback riding in Versailles which my wife LOVED.  In Alsace we were able to explore picturesque villages and learn about what makes Alsatian wine unique at family estates with generations of experience.  We even had a unique trip to the mountains to hike with a truly authentic lunch at a local farm without another tourist in sight.  We would never have had access to such experiences without Laurence.  We will be grateful for these memories for the rest of our lives. We just returned from an 8 day trip to France and had Laurence with ParisTouJours plan all of our accommodations, transportation and get tickets for what we wanted to see.  I cannot say enough good things about our experience with Laurence!  She met us at our hotel when we got to Paris and she had everything expertly planned out in great detail.  We spent a few days in Paris, then on to Normandy, Amboise, Toulouse and back to Paris.  All of our accommodations were outstanding, our drivers were always on time and courteous and Laurence had every step of the way planned out.  She listened to our interests and what we wanted to see.  It was awesome to have tickets in advance for everything as we avoided long lines and had intimate small tours.  She even made recommendations for restaurants when we asked.  We would recommend Laurence for any trip that you want to plan in France.  She is 5star all the way! A thousand thank yous to Manon and ParisToujours for an unforgettable trip to Paris for our Mother's 80th birthday!  She planned a perfect trip from start to finish.  We loved the Hotel d'Orsay which she chose for us.  All of the tours she arranged were excellent and we enjoyed our guides immensely  Nicolas, Annemarie and Melanie, especially!  All of our drivers were on time and so personable  special thanks to Innocent, Jerome and Joe.  The restaurants she booked were lovely and delicious. The menus suited us perfectly and the service was impeccable.  We have memories for a lifetime! We just returned from a 7night trip to France. We had a group of four that ranged in age from 18 to 74.  The team at ParisToujours created a wonderful seamless plan that worked well for the entire group.  Before and during the trip, communication was very good.  We received a detailed roadmap just before our departure.  Our requests were incorporated in such a nice way.  The entire trip went to plan with no issues. The hotel selection was lovely.  Laurence, our tour guides, drivers, and the hotel staff were welcoming and made the trip magical.  AnneMarie and Marie, our tour guides in Paris, were knowledgeable and fun to spend time with touring the city.  Our guides in Champagne and the Loire Valley were very good as well. All four of us loved the trip and wished we could have stayed longer.  We will return!

So to be fair, they did refund 39 euros out of the 180 euros and I was not even asking for all of it.  I had told them to keep the entrance fee of 34 euros. 17 for each adult and  my child was free. I also didnt ask for a refund for the second tour at Eiffel Tower because at least the guide was with us till the end.  We messaged from the very beginning of the Versailles tour and we didnt hear back from guide till now, one week later and he was very rude.  Everything I said about being unprofessional is true.  Read other reviews about their attitudes toward customers. If he would have messaged apologizing and asking nicely about the review, I would have changed it because of them trying to be nice and apologizing for their mistake.   Not to a 4 or 5 but more than a one star.  I have proof to everything I have just said if they want to say I lied about anything.


Save your money and dont book with this company.  Unfortunately we booked two tours with them before coming to Paris and both were bad.  The first one in palace of Versailles was the worst.  The guide lost us in the second room and she didnt even notice she lost us.  We never found her. We contacted the tour company right away and they never answered my messages.  We looked from room to room and nothing.  We could hear her through headphones and she would not say what room she was in or noticed we were going. She kept on walking.  She was very short and didnt even have one of those sticks to see her.  We ended up loosing her in the headphones piece too so it made it harder.  When tour ended all they cared about was to get their machines with earpieces back. We explained what happened and even asked if we messaged the tour company which we had said yes and showed them the proof and no response.  They went on to say, oh they barely answer messages.  Then why ask if I messaged then?!
When they thanked us for returning their machines,  they said they had lost 1015 of them that day from people who also got lost and never returned them.  So youre saying you always loose people but dont care?
Second tour was of Eiffel Tower.  Guide was better than Versailles but barely told us history of the tower.  He gave us like 5 minutes of facts while we stood in front of the elevator and then left us when we got to the second floor.  The line to elevator was long and wait was an hour a there is absolutely no advantage to booking with this company because we still had to wait behind the people who just bought elevator tickets for that day for a lot less.
Please just book just tickets in advance straight from the place youre going and dont use this tour company.  There is no skip the line tour Eiffel Tower
We spent a little more but it was worth it our companion was the French Gerard pigtail and goatee he spoke 4 languages and perfect English
Nice and friendly, very professional who denies the stereotype of the pompous Frenchman This was very good, the guide spoke clearly so that we could carefully follow the history of the Eiffel Tower.
I strongly advise it","Monday: 8:30 AM – 5:30 PM

Korean Style Minbak No.2 PARIS 넘버투민박,"8 Bd de Strasbourg, 75010 Paris, France",4,48.8701173,2.3550373,"I was very nervous as it was my first time traveling abroad alone, so I made a reservation at a Korean guesthouse! First of all, there is no restaurant on the first floor, but a mart, so it was easy to buy daily necessities, and it is a clean building! I think I was able to get around easily even late at night because it was in front of a big road! The subway can be reached in 2 minutes, and a place to rent a bicycle is nearby!

The accommodation was clean and had a warm atmosphere, and even though it was October, I slept well without being cold! The owner cooked breakfast every day, so I was able to start my trip after eating a warm meal.

Because it is a Korean guesthouse, you can communicate with Koreans and get travel information I think it was the cornerstone of my happy memories during the 7day trip.
The owner was friendly and the food was delicious. Meals such as chicken porridge, budae stew, boiled pork, etc. were served, and thanks to this, we were able to save on food costs.

The staff were also friendly. I was impressed by the effort they made to provide as many services as possible.

The location was also great. It was within walking distance to the Louvre below and Montmartre Hill above.

I plan to visit again when I visit Paris again. I have been staying at Number Two BB for over 2 weeks since last week!
The breakfast was really delicious, and the composition was plentiful, so I was able to start my day with a hearty meal every day  SaJang's cooking skills are so good that my weight plump up hahaha.

I really liked that the cleaning lady and staff cleaned it every day.
It seemed like they cleaned the bathroom and hair thoroughly, and I was very satisfied that the blankets and towels were washed every day.

I was happy because the owner and employees were so warmhearted 
I hope you prosper! I'm a person who likes France and Europe, so I've been back and forth there a few times.
Before I go, I always look at reviews of accommodations.
I don't often write reviews because I think the good stuff is good, but I'm sharing it for the public interest.

When I looked before, there were a lot of 1star reviews, but all the reviews have disappeared.
Seeing that there were only 3 new reviews on the same day, it looks like the location was registered again. Is this something like place washing?

First of all, this place is located on the second floor, but because Europe has high ceilings, the stairs are almost like climbing stairs.
But there is no help. If your suitcase is heavy, please consider somewhere other than this place.

And I think the cleanliness is a bit lacking.
There were a lot of old reviews saying it was dirty, but I guess they were sensitive guests even though it was cheaper than a hotel.
I didn't think it was a big deal, but now that I think about it, they weren't really sensitive people.
They give you one towel each, but there are different types of towels. Customers say they are leaving it behind. They are probably throwing it away.
It's used by customers again. There's not much to say about the feel or smell.

Among the guesthouse guests, there will be many who are new to Europe and have no experience with other accommodations.
They originally said Paris was dirty, but it seemed like they were wondering if that was the case here too.
I've been to many places, but Europe isn't all dirty like here, so think carefully.

I said it was good because the breakfast was Korean food and it was free, but it was really free so I just ate it.
It's all good, but I mixed leftover rice from yesterday and made soup with yesterday's soup, and it's a different dish! They say it's too much to do.
The CEO's tsundere attitude is also criticized a lot.
Don't expect kindness, the boss is the boss. Does it feel like you should leave if you don't like it?
Ah, if you're pretty, you'll probably be excluded haha

Because it's cheaper than a hotel, they serve Korean food, and because the owner is Korean, I feel secure.
I think people are looking for a Korean bed and breakfast for various reasons.
I couldn't ask the boss directly because I was scared.
No matter how much I thought about it, this place didn't seem like an official lodging company.
As you all know, illegal companies do not take responsibility if problems or accidents occur to travelers just for their own safety.
Of course, you may trust Marit or Minda to make a reservation, but they also have no choice.
The country of Europe is gorgeous and nice to look at, but it is also a dangerous place.
You must take care of your own safety! Please keep this in mind.

The people I stayed with at the time when I didn't know anything about fashion were nice and it was nice to chat with them.
I didn't want to go back because the facilities and service were so bad.
Since then, I've been going to regular companies, hotels, or even Airbnb if possible.

Many people say that the location here is good, and that is of course true.
However, there are also good locations, clean and friendly places.

Once again, we would like to inform you that this review was written for the public interest. I recommend it if you are looking for a decent Korean bed and breakfast. I used a 4person female dormitory, but there were no people there, so I was almost alone, so it was comfortable. Even though I stayed there in a hurry, they accepted me right away. There is a shower in the room, but you have to go out to use the bathroom. I didn't really feel any inconvenience while using it... Oh, there's no air conditioning. It was very hot the day I arrived in Paris. It was a bit hot, perhaps because it was the only accommodation without air conditioning during my trip to Europe. However, since Korean food is served for breakfast, you can save money on food!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Although this is a bridge, the place is so romantic and beautiful. With all these views and monuments around, it makes it the perfect place to be. A very good spot to watch the Eiffel Tower and take photos. On the Seine river. It is highly recommended to walk through it and photograph the Eiffel Tower in all its splendor. A wonder.

Nice collection of art work with painting of old and modern masters, sculptures, furniture. You can easily spend  your whole day here. The garden is beautiful, there are lounge chairs to relax and enjoy the view.
Definitely less crowded than the  Louvre.
A gem to not be missed! A very nice and free spot to spend some quality time in Paris, short walk from Concorde and Champs Elysees. Opened on Tuesday when most of other museums are closed, also not as busy as other museums. Stunning ceilings and pieces of art but above all, a serene garden with plenty of chairs to enjoy the outdoors. Access is free, no need to book a ticket, just go through security. Museum plan available in French and English, also a guide application to download. Theres a shop, toilet and consigne left luggage available on site. Beautiful place to visit and free to enter.  I'd advise going early if you want to sit out with a coffee and enjoy the surroundings.  Nice way to spend an hour or so, while out sightseeing. Loved it  my daughter studies art and was keen to go. I was taken aback by the beauty if the building and the inner courtyard garden. Unfortunately the cafe was too busy to sit but it looked great.
The art work was an eclectic mixture of the modern and classic which made for an interesting visit. With free entry this is well worth a look. Best value so far in Paris. Free with no line up. Easy to spend a few hours walking around. Two floors. Mix of contemporary art. Definitely worth the visit. The garden in the center was peaceful with a cafe too","Monday: Closed

Place de la Concorde,"75008 Paris, France",4.5,48.8656331,2.3212357,"Such an inspiring place with such a dark past. Site of the infamous guillotine where most of the gentry met their end. Now a tourist attraction and events venue. Ornate fountains surround the Obelisk that is adorned with Egyptian Hieroglyphics. Ironically the Place can be seen in direct line from the original Palace of the Louvre. I was unable to get closer as the site was being restored after the Olympics. Place de la Concorde was impressively transformed into an urban sports complex for the Olympics. This historic square as a vibrant sports hub was a sight to see, with the skate park standing out. It was fascinating to see such a classic Parisian landmark seamlessly adapted for contemporary sports and activities  a fresh and dynamic experience. Wonderful experience shared with my son. Everyone should share Paris with someone they love. Place de la Concorde is one of Pariss most historic and impressive squares, located between the Champslyses and the Tuileries Garden. Its known for its grandeur, with the iconic Egyptian obelisk standing at its center, surrounded by beautiful fountains and statues. The square offers stunning views of major Paris landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. Its rich history and central location make it a mustvisit for anyone exploring the city, offering a perfect blend of French history, architecture, and charm. This is a spectacular plaza in Paris. The water fountains are beautiful even if water is not flowing. It is located at the end of the Tuileries garden and start of the Champs Elysee.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Jardin des Plantes,"75005 Paris, France",4.6,48.8439069,2.359658,"Went here towards the end of our trip, mainly to get away from the Centre of Paris to chill out. It's a really cute and relaxing location. Plenty of places to walk to. We paid to get into the botanical garden. Gets really nice when the sun starts to lower especially with the leaves this time of year. Huge park, wide, sandy running track around it. Amazing trees, spring will be incredible with the Japanese blossoms. We visited on a gorgeous autumn day A nice getaway park from the city noise. Pleasant to walk around and admire the statues and installations. I would advise to come when the sun starts to set, that way you get the daylight views and the illuminations when they switch the lights on which is on the installtions. I feel like there could be a few more vendors and public toilet facilities within the park but still, a worthwhile visit especially if you have children. A beautiful and wellmaintained park. A good place to cool off on hot summer days. There are also nice museums you can visit in the park. I visited the one about mineralogy. Spent 56 hours wandering around this garden in late August. A great variety of plants, trees, buildings to view and explore. Very excited to find a wollemi pine beside the stegosaurus at the paleontology museum. Down the river seine side.  Menagerie kept kids going for 3 hours. Little zoo. The oldest iron monument in Paris.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 6:30 PM

A rounded square just at the corner near the hotel de ville area and also walkable to Notre dame. But just nice to resting and sit down after your long walk.

Another great column from Napoleon Bonaparte's time to remember his victories.

Statue of Liberty Paris,"All. des Cygnes, 75015 Paris, France",4.5,48.8500168,2.2796956,"Beautiful place, you feel that you are in NYC in the USA,when you see the statues. Its free to visit. Also you can see the Eiffel Tower completely from there, plus they have free sports machines behind the statue if you like to workout . I recommend you to visit it. I recently visited the Statue of Liberty in Paris, and it was a delightful experience! This smaller version of the iconic New York statue that is located on the le aux Cygnes in the Seine River. The setting is beautiful, offering picturesque views of the river and the surrounding cityscape. It's a peaceful spot perfect for a leisurely stroll or a moment of reflection. The statue itself is impressive and a wonderful symbol of the friendship between France and the United States. Overall, it's a mustvisit landmark that adds a unique charm to the Parisian experience. The Statue of Liberty in Paris, located on the le aux Cygnes in the Seine River, is a smaller replica of the iconic American monument. Gifted by the American community in Paris to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution, this statue stands at about 11.5 meters tall. It faces westward, symbolically looking towards its larger counterpart in New York. The statue's location offers a picturesque view, and its significance highlights the enduring friendship between France and the United States. It's a charming and historically rich landmark that adds a unique touch to the Parisian landscape. This Statue of Liberty Paris is located on what is called swan Island accessible on foot by walking on one of the bridges that crosses the Siene River Pont De Grenelle. When you go under this bridge via the stairs towards the statue, you will also walkthrough an outdoor workout gym that was constructed underneath the bridge.

In addition, this charming square offers a beautiful view of the capital and the staircase of Rue du Calvaire. A slightly quieter place next to Place du Tertre, perfect for enjoying a drink, occasionally listening to street musicians and enjoying the view.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Musée d'Orsay,"Esplanade Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, 75007 Paris, France",4.8,48.8599614,2.3265614,"Fantastic museum! Incredible collection of impressionist paintings by a variety of masters. Plus many other paintings and statues. It's in an old train station that was converted into the museum. Very well designed. Very nice feel to the museum. Highly recommended. This is an excellent museum and, in my opinion,  a mustsee when in Paris. It's a more manageable size when compared to the Louvre.  It's well laid out and accessible. I think we spent 34 hours here and saw everything else wanted to see. We bought our tickets in advance and had a minimal line.  I really enjoy the Impressionists and was very satisfied when I left. I recommend this museum and I will definitely come back again. I am inclined to prefer this place over the Louvre, its still a very large space but on multiple floors in a single central location so to navigate is not an issue. We had no queue to get in either with our pre paid tickets. So many things to see here, you could spend half a day or more if you took the time to appreciate the setting and the various paintingssculptures that is here. Also a few opportunities to get some pictures of the outside. Oh and there will be a large queue to get a picture by the clock, personally I don't see the appeal a picture Infront of the clock, especially with a phone as its likely the background will be over exposed or the other way around, but a more interesting picture is getting one from the sides or behind people as it gives a better sense of the scale of the various clocks here. We visited the Muse d'Orsay in the last week of August 2024 and had a great experience overall. However, one tip for other visitors avoid purchasing ""skip the line"" tickets from thirdparty sellers, especially if you're planning to visit on a weekday morning. The crowds were lite during our visit, and the line for onsite tickets was minimal, so the extra cost for those tickets wasn't worth it in our case. The crowds may vary seasonally, but this is something to keep in mind if you're visiting during a quieter time.

As for the museum itself, it's very well organized. Its also quite kidfriendly, with elevators available throughout the building, making it accessible for strollers and wheelchairs alike. There's a large cafeteria inside too which we haven't tried but seemed reasonable priced based on a quick glance on the menu.

While the museum is much smaller compared to the Louvre, you can comfortably explore it in 2 to 3 hours. We started at the top on the 5th floor, where the oldest paintings from the mid to late 1800sparticularly the Impressionist paintings are housed. As you work your way down, you move through postImpressionist works, which often depict older historical events but were painted later.

Overall, it was a lovely couple of hours spent surrounded by incredible art in a more intimate and less overwhelming setting than the other larger museums around there In my opinion, this is the concept of what a perfect museum should strive to be. Everything was very accessible and easy to follow. The museum followed a chronological experience and took you on a voyage of 70 years of the most important works in art history between 1850 and 1920. The museums layout and amenities were perfect and my visit couldnt have gone better. World class museum that every Parisgoer should plan a morning or afternoon visiting. 55","Monday: Closed

It was part of a church before the French revolution, but the church was mostly destroyed and only this part remained. This is a quiet little park in the middle of one of my favorite parts of Paris.  It is not far from the Pompidou. I did not go up in the tower but it was a nice experience all the same. There were plenty of benches to sit on with trees accompanying them to provide some shade.

This is a very nice place to walk at any time, restaurants are great away from tourists always you get better service. At night is great to seat and enjoy a quiet time next to the Senna. There is a small park here at the tip of the island. It a shame that the deportation memorial has now fenced off the ability to be at the point of the island. It must have been a great vantage point to take snapshots. There is a row of park benches underneath the trees. This makes for a good cooling off spot on a hot summer day. Ah, Square de l'le de France, what a lovely place! Located in the heart of Paris, this square is known for its beautiful gardens and tranquil atmosphere. It's a fantastic spot to take a leisurely stroll, have a picnic, or simply relax and enjoy the surroundings.

The square is adorned with lush greenery, colorful flowers, and charming pathways. You'll find benches scattered throughout, providing the perfect spot to sit and soak up the peaceful ambiance. It's a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and unwind for a while.

If you're a fan of history, you might be interested to know that the square is named after le de France, the historical region surrounding Paris. It's a nod to the rich heritage and cultural significance of the area.

Whether you're a local looking for a serene retreat or a visitor hoping to discover a hidden gem, Square de l'le de France is definitely worth a visit. Enjoy the tranquility and beauty it has to offer! Is there anything else I can assist you with? Beutiful place that looks like a painting..  especially after rain. Lovely.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 6:30 PM

I was able to benefit from a 50 reduction thanks to my CE, so we took our 12 year old daughter there. 45minute visit, fully automated but very interesting, fun, we laughed a lot. We were a small group, no waiting. We came away delighted. Disappointed because it was broken With some English friends passing through Paris, we went to visit the backstage of the great Rex. Everything worked very well for... 5 minutes at the end of which we found ourselves at the exit where an employee asked us if we liked it and if everything had gone well. When we told him we hadn't seen anything, he was surprised, and after explanations, he kindly refunded us. Never mind, we will go back!!! Please note, this place is not to be confused with the cinema. This is a bit of a behindthescenes tour of the Grand Rex retracing its history and a bit of the history of cinema. Nice for a little outing with friends or for a fun date . A very good surprise entry certainly a little expensive 11 eurosperson but acceptable given the originality of the visit. We have a great time there and have a lot of fun. In addition, the reception and boutique staff are very friendly in Paris, this is rare enough to be mentioned. Quite nice to do but you have to go early in the morning so as not to be in the crowd before 10 a.m. Plus we went on Heritage Day so it was a nice half price.",no operation time,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment"

If you get into the place early, there arent many people, and you can see some other visitors dancing while the jazz band performs. The place is very popular, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. When my friend and I arrived at opening time, we had to wait about 15 minutes. Theres often a long queue, but its definitely worth the wait. Its unfortunately a tiktok place right now. Inside is so much crowded that you can not enjoy any of the music. Its just packed, without air and you wait in line to get in. we went on a thursday evening

Normal entry is 14, for students its 10. Its good that they have two prices cause most of the people are tourists. Im not complaining about it being a touristy place, but they should lower the number of maximum people that can be inside at the same time. Because for now, its like a musical sauna in a basement  Get there early as there will be a line.  Dance floor and band in basement is very crowded, but a blast.  The only time I can remember where people are not doom scrolling phones.  Crazy to be dancing in a room where Templars met..... The atmosphere in this place is crazy. Its filled to the brim with people on the weekends and people dance and yell and go crazy. There was even a proposal she said, yes. Normal entry fee was 16 euros A very fun live jazz bar!!! The band who was playing was wonderful and everyone was so happy! You can sit down and listen or dance with amazing music. 

The only downside was that it can get very hot and humid downstairs  but the fun makes you forget the uncomfortable feeling haha. Id love to go back again!","Monday: 9:00 PM – 2:00 AM

We hadn't drank nor intoxicated. Security let the people in behind us with woman I asked why he didn't let us in and he basically said was because of that we didn't have any woman with us.

Very unprofessional security staff I will be going to the press about this. The best club of techno Ive ever been sooooo far, super super nice music, super hard techno, super cool people dancing and working there, the people in the dressers, tickets and restrooms are suuuuuper super cool and the whole experience is amazing, honestly 2010, speechless, Im from Mexico and I can tell if Ill ever visit back paris Im sure Ill be back to Rex club for sure. Whats the point of selling tickets if you still play the bouncer game? What a stupid place. The doorknob at the door making minimum wage lording it over people whos sneakers cost more than her life, but probably the only power she has on this earth. Spent 40 on an Uber there. Said it was open on google. Met about 25 people outside looking for it CLOSED!!! For good!? Check other reviews, 1 star It was definitely worth the experience.

The DJs were great. It was definitely a show. The room was huge, and Saturday was PACKED. It was wheelchair accessible! I saw multiple people in wheelchairs enjoying themselves and maneuvering around.

Music for everyone. Multiple Rooms.

Dont expect service, food, waiters, etc. This is just a straight club. Even when you get your bottle, they just give you your bottle and section, and thats it for the night. As a tourist, my experience was not great!
This place was recommended to me by a local so I wanted to try it. 20 entry to a place that is completely crowded. There is no way to move around without being stuck with each other. Very arrogant security staff. At the end of the evening, I had to wait for an Uber alone to return to my hotel and I asked to stay alongside them because I kept being bothered by the guys from the club or even homeless guys, they just ask me to move !
When I read the other comments, I see that what is happening is a scandal, but what is even more scandalous is the lack of reaction from the owners !
Do Better! Emplacement of the club is cool but the staff is not educated to serve the customers, such a shame to have such a bad combination toward the customers. At the bar we were served by two arrogant bartenders. I am ashamed as a local Parisian how this bartenders treat their customers for sure they have to educate the stuff at the bar to have a better communication ! Respect is a must! One of the best places I ate and chilled at. Great food and vibe and a large seating area. It overlooks the River Seine and gives a great view in the evening. Food was great and drinks were perfect. Had a large pizza with some nachos. you guys want to take more than you can fit.

I was dreaming to see Anderson Paak for the last week, in the end I saw NOTHING. this is the worst experience of my concert in Paris, and in general for the whole life
I would like the organizers to return the money for the tickets to the artist, because I have never seen such a fraud, but I think it will never be possible! well done, never come here again","Monday: Closed

Le Duplex,"2 bis Av. Foch, 75116 Paris, France",2.5,48.8736629,2.2925442,"Horrible experience, as a Canadian Im privy to very sweet and positive people. This club has horrible people who were very rude about dress code. I entered the club 2 nights in a row wearing the same style of outfit with shirts with no sleeves and they denied entry the third time and put their hands on me. I do not recommend i can see a lot of negative reviews but i had a great experience and lots of fun!

I was there dec 31st there were two rooms with different genre of music and a smoking area. Spent 2025 for entering  1 drink and 2  for the coat check. I was surprised after seeing all this negative reviews. Me and my friends went there on a week day And had an amazing time. The music was commercial and the Dj playing that night was playing great music. Next time I visit Paris i will go back. Just to be precise, I got there arround midnight which in general is not the best time to get on a club...
My friends told me the club had an horrible vibe ""the worst club I have ever been"" was the exact quote from my London friend!
Why am I talking about a friend and not myself? Well cause I was blocked outside, I tried to ask the reason and they didn't give any... The chief of security was extremely rude, didn't look me in the eyes when I was asking the reason and kept saying ""I don't know you"" as a reason... Man of course you don't know me!
The rest of the staff was really good and chill, just the chief of security was the problem... Maybe some lessons on how to deal with human beings... awful experience.
15 and 16 years old girls can come inside but  people with shorts cant.
even inside it was so bad.
not a lot of people, bad music every rooms
and they re racist and apply social and racial discrimination.

Bridge Club,"3 Port des Champs-Élysées, 75008 Paris, France",2.3,48.8640808,2.3121334,"I recently had an incredibly disappointing experience at The Bridge in Paris.

My friends and I, a group of six from different ethnic backgrounds and with a good gender ratio 3 men and 3 women, made a reservation online and were excited about our night out.

We even paid for a van to ensure we arrived together and on time.

However, despite our reservation and preparation, we were not allowed entry.

The staff offered no explanation, and their attitude felt dismissive and discriminatory. This experience ruined our night and left us feeling humiliated.

I expected much better from a venue like The Bridge.

Save your time and money and look for a more inclusive and respectful place to enjoy your night out. Despite the crowd and the minor service issue, I had a great time. The club's vibrant atmosphere and unique Parisian charm make it worth a visit.

If you're looking to experience Parisian nightlife, Bridge Club is a solid choice. Just make sure to book ahead and be ready for a lively crowd. This venue is under the northeast side of the bridge, with the line typically starting above the righthand side of the bridge. I arrived at 130am, and was in line until 245am before entering. I attended the Agents of Time  me live  Yet More show put on by Haiku. I was nervous to come here after reading the negative reviews my experience was great, however. I didnt drink, but I purchased the pricy water 8. Bar staff was very friendly, security was reasonable, and I felt very safe. Even the bathroom was well organized by staff so the line kept moving. The vibes were great  a good mixed crowd in terms of age and locals  visitors. Room to dance, or to move to the front. The lights were fantastic. The only thing I didnt like were the aholes who cut the line, and the glass beer bottles on the floor none were broken during my visit fortunately. Solid place to see a show. Would give zero stars if i could. The queue is long and place overcroded. Not to mention there are pickpockets there that have stolen phones out of people's bags on multiple occasions and security does not help at all or do anything about a situation that has been brought to their attention several times. Would not go back, would definitely not recommend. Save your money and go somewhere decent. Horrible experience. Aggressive and extremely disrespectful bouncers that make you feel more like inmates than guests at a venue. The bar is overpriced and the untrained bartenders are overwhelmed with the amount of people, average 20 minutes for a drink, no surprise there, they were also disrespectful. The cherry on top is that theres no toilet cabines for men, they just assume that any man going to a cabin must be doing drugs and treat you as such, if they finally let you go into one, youll have bouncer knock on the door and look over it in the less than a minute. Never again.","Monday: 12:00 – 6:00 AM

There were 2 rooms with 2 different kind of music, one was techno and the other was drum  bass, I liked going to see both!
Also amazing location, center of Paris Bartenders speak English well and bouncers were chill. Had a fun time here. Nice music, great atmosphere, cool people! The only bad point is that the place is too small If you know how to go out then you will have a good time at this club. Like any discotech it fills up after 1am. Some reviews complain about bag check. My advice if you have to bring a bag to a club then stay home.

Bois de Vincennes,"Rte de la Pyramide, 75012 Paris, France",4.5,48.8282797,2.4330972,"You don't need to pay anything to enter here. Near this place is Chateau Vincennes, a really big castle. Unfortunately when i visited this area the place was closed, but i could walk in the woods.

This area is really big, and has a lot to offer, especially on the other side, you will find Lac Daumesnil. You won't regret going there. My fave jardin parc in 20th eme in Paris. Its totally free to enter, you can do almost anything you want, jogging, walking, running whether you alone or in a group. Visit the arboretum the river just sitting down alone to contemplate your life, reading a book, kissing a with your lover.
But please keep it beautiful as it is.
Im just running here circling the park and it turned out to my half marathon run. Optimal for walking, biking, jogging and ... during the day. At night there is another business on  not to recommend ... Bois de Vincennes, located on the eastern edge of Paris, is one of the largest green spaces in the city, offering a stunning retreat from the urban hustle. Often referred to as the lungs of Paris, this expansive park covers nearly 2,500 acres, making it a haven for nature lovers, joggers, cyclists, and families looking to relax outdoors.

The parks diverse landscapes range from sprawling meadows and thick woodlands to picturesque lakes, creating a variety of ecosystems that are home to numerous bird species and wildlife. One of the highlights is the Lac Daumesnil, where visitors can rent boats and float peacefully, surrounded by lush greenery. The Parc Floral is another mustsee, especially in spring and summer when the vibrant flower displays are in full bloom. For those interested in history, the Chteau de Vincennes, a medieval fortress located at the parks edge, adds a touch of cultural charm.

Bois de Vincennes is wellequipped with paths for biking and walking, making it an ideal spot for those looking to stay active. Theres also a small zoo, the Parc Zoologique de Paris, and an equestrian center for horseback riding enthusiasts. The parks peaceful atmosphere and size make it feel like a natural escape, despite being just a short metro ride from central Paris.

The park hosts various events throughout the year, from concerts to festivals, adding a lively cultural element to the natural surroundings. Whether youre after a peaceful walk, a scenic picnic, or just some fresh air, Bois de Vincennes offers something for everyone, blending the tranquility of nature with the charm of Paris. Very big and lively park. Jogging, picnic, doing sports, cycling, zoo park etc you can do everything here. Also if you like to study botanics, there are different kinds of parks.","Monday: 9:30 AM – 8:00 PM

Museum of Hunting and Nature,"62 Rue des Archives, 75003 Paris, France",4.5,48.8614056,2.3587005,"Completely out of the mainstream mindset  dead animals, guns and paintings of hunters and dead animals. I let you imagine how weird it can look at first in todays world.
Yet it is a brilliant must see place in Paris. Always good surprises to discover. Mix of tradition and fun cutting edge modern arts.
I love it much better than the neighbouring Picasso museum Its quirky, but if youre fine with taxidermy, youll appreciate how this museum mixes modern art with the stuffed animals. Tickets are just over 10 Euros and it took us an hour to go through, enjoying every room. The signs are in French. To be honest, I don't recommend it. Charging 13 for such an exposition is too much. There are more artworks than nature here. I'm also annoyed by the guards who follow your every move, there are more of them than exhibits Taxidermy, black feathered book cave and guns!

Not exactly my jam, but holy cow it totally was!  Not only is it in the heart of the Marias, but it is in the MOST gorgeous mansion, with a gorgeous museum gift shop.  Who knew?!

The current exhibition by Tamara Kistianovsky of cloth sculptures inspired by nature is exquisite! It is so well curated and placed that you feel like you walked into an alternate world where elegance meets whimsy!

Go for a coffee to Sevenly Heaven across the street and luxuriate A very strange museum which isnt for the faint hearted. A mix of old and new, taxidermy animals and contemporary art related to nature. I enjoyed it but didnt feel great about the whole theme. Most of the museum is accessible but there is a small area at the end that is accessed with stairs. Has a gift shop.

Lots of little cafes as well. Good also if you are a trail runner and looking for some smaller challenging runs in the city Parc Montsouris is a true oasis in Paris. Tucked away from the bustling city, it's incredibly peaceful and serene. The expansive green lawns, beautiful lake, and winding paths create the perfect setting for a relaxing walk or quiet picnic. Whether you're looking to unwind with a book under a tree or simply enjoy the tranquility of nature, this park is the ideal spot. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a peaceful escape within the city. Beautiful park, super nice landscaping. It gets a bit crowded on hot days, since its the only green spot in this area of town.

Great for kids. They have games, both free and paid. Lots of space to play with balls.

Its a pity they close so early during winter, you cant even take a stroll after work. They also close it with some wind, so check before going. I wanted to take a quiet stroll at the end of long day, so I chose Parc Montsouris because it was a short bus ride from my hotel.  It was the best choice I could have made.  The park has beautiful naturalistic landscaping and wide, winding paths that are ideal for leisurely walks.

There was also an eerie art installation in the large pond that features some ghostly, fairylike beings.  Seeing it at dusk made the experience all the more haunting  memorable.

Parc Montsouris is ideal for picnics, running, bird watching, strolling, sitting on a bench to enjoy a good book or hang out with a friend. Beautiful little  not too park. A lot of grass space to hangout with friends, a lake, a walking path around the park. Not a tourist park.

Esplanade des Invalides,"1 Rue Fabert, 75007 Paris, France",4.5,48.86100450000001,2.3132288,"The Esplanade des Invalides is a vast and peaceful green space in the heart of Paris, offering stunning views of the Htel des Invalides and its magnificent golden dome. It's a perfect spot for a leisurely stroll, picnic, or simply relaxing while taking in the surrounding historic architecture. The wide open lawns provide a serene atmosphere, and it's a great place to admire the grandeur of Paris. Located near major attractions like the Eiffel Tower and the Seine, the Esplanade des Invalides is a lovely escape from the hustle and bustle, blending history and tranquility. This vast, open space in the heart of Paris is surrounded by beautiful gardens and historic buildings. The majestic Htel des Invalides, with its striking golden dome, stands prominently in the background, adding to the area's charm. Walking along the esplanade, I enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere and the wellmaintained lawns and paths. Its a great spot to relax, take a leisurely stroll, or simply admire the impressive architecture and history around you. Olimpic Games  Paralimpic Games. Nice to relax in you free time. Enjoy the restaurants and clubs near feom hear. What a gorgeous place! The army museum is enormous but the most impressive was the dome with Napoleons tombe. We thought it was fearly cheap for the overall experience. there is so much to see in different parts of the building. It's close on Thursday so make sure that you will not plan visit on Thursday.

The Eiffel Tower Garden,"Tour Eiffel - Parc du Champ-de-Mars, 75007 Paris, France",4.4,48.8574446,2.2957701,"I visited the Eiffel Tower gardens today and was thoroughly impressed. The meticulously maintained lawns, vibrant flowerbeds, and charming pathways create a serene atmosphere, perfect for a leisurely stroll. The gardens offer stunning views of the Eiffel Tower, providing ample photo opportunities. Benches scattered throughout allow for moments of rest and reflection, making it an ideal spot to unwind. The combination of lush greenery and the iconic backdrop of the Eiffel Tower makes these gardens a mustvisit for anyone in Paris. Gorgeous view, came on a Monday between 2pm3pm just the 3 of us. Got a few shops in the middle of the tower that do pizzas, chips, refreshments. We wanted a slush whilst it was 37 and obviously its a sell out on a day like that, so wasn't able to grab one. No bother, there was still plenty of refreshments to grab.

Nice views of Paris, was definitely worth the experience! I'd recommend extra staff for the Cafe areas as we were lined up for 30 minutes with 2 people serving, but they were polite and friendly and overall the experience is something we all very much enjoyed and recommend  People will moan about about the crowds but its paris!

Once you get past that you will be gobsmacked by the sheer beauty that is the eiffel tower and the lovely ponds and gardens .

We went at night which i would recommend as during the day the tower can look a bit glum . But at night is just impressive by anyone's standards and if you're lucky to be there when the light show is on you will love it.

Quite the wait for the 2 x lifts to reach the top but worth the wait if you only do it once in your life. I was lucky enough to be able to watch the Olympic medal matches for the womens beach volleyball in the Eiffel garden stadium. It created a unique experience I will never forget. every season has a different perception of this tower, that's why I always come to see the Eiffel Tower when I'm in Paris. I really understand the Parisians when they were against this Tower , it really violates the architecture of the city a little, but there is no more famous place in the world entrance to the tower is 25 euros by the way and you can wait from 40 minutes to 4 hours, so choose your time wisely, the best on weekday mornings.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Belleville Park,"47 Rue des Couronnes, 75020 Paris, France",4.2,48.8710678,2.3847051,"Nice quiet park. Very steep up to the Belvedere with a stunning view over Paris. You can rest on the terrace of Caf Moncoeur. Nice looking park but closes really early in the evening and it gets really busy if the weather is good Personally, I liked the park and my kids loved the tiered playground. But there is a bit of a sketchy vibe  doesnt feel as safe or relaxing as the Butte Chaumont for instance. It's a nice park. If you do go all to the way to the top there is a bit of a view with the Eiffel tower in the distance but it's in the distance and the view is somewhat obstructed? Anyway, there are roses and other flowers planted so at certain times of year I'd bet it looks particularly attractive. In my autumn visit the leaves had turned yellow on some trees and it's kinda nice. It has park benches and an amphitheatre. Overall looks deceptively small but there's quite a bit to it, mostly in cosy sized sections. LOVE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD and spent a whole day exploring this area of the 20th. I started near the top of Parc de Belleville which has nice views of Paris and then wandered down thru Belleville. Highlights included the Dancing Goat which looks really cool and gets rave reviews, La Campagne  Paris a very charming housing development from 1907, and lots of street art esp. Rue Denoyez.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 5:00 PM

Parc Monceau,"35 Bd de Courcelles, 75008 Paris, France",4.6,48.8796835,2.308955,"Parc Monceau is a beautiful and peaceful oasis in the heart of Paris. The park is wellmaintained, with lovely walking paths, picturesque bridges, and charming statues. Its the perfect spot for a leisurely stroll, a quiet picnic, or just relaxing in nature. The park also has a playground for kids, making it great for families. I love the blend of nature and art here, with its tranquil ponds and historical architecture. A hidden gem away from the hustle and bustle of the city! Really nice park close to all the popular tourist spots. I pass through here each day and also used to live close by. The only problem with this park is that there is no dog space. It's absolutely insane and for the amount of people who have dogs in the dog they really need to cater for these people. Beautiful flowers and green area here. Also great place to run if you are looking for something quick  its just over a kilometre per loop. This such a lovely park. It is nice for a stroll. Many varieties of plants are in the gardens. The park is surrounded by mansions and other large buildings. As a semiprivate park, the mansions have 24 hour access to the park. The park is ornamented with lakes, statues, and architectural features. Entry from Avenue Velazquez will take you through a magnificent gate. Its an exquisite and beautiful garden in Paris 8th arrondissement.
Oh I hope I can lay down on its bench for just enjoying the slow sunset with such a beautiful view of flowers, the pond lake with the swans swimming, the water fountains and so many artsy statuesque.

The perfect weather just to enjoy this in between autumn and winter. An absolutely enchanting place to spend your Saturday or Sunday downtime. Flowers blooming among marbled statues, slow strolls remind you to take your breath while you step. Benches serve you to pause and eat the savory crepe and espresso.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Parc zoologique de Paris,"Av. Daumesnil, 75012 Paris, France",4.3,48.83340930000001,2.4144067,"The zoo is very beautiful and wellmaintained. The rare animals, especially the marine ones, are a delight to see. The zoo is wellindicated, and the animals seem happy and wellcared for. However, I noticed that the baboon monkeys seemed to be in need of more vegetation in their enclosure. I hope the zoo administration will consider addressing this issue. The Amazon corner of the zoo is particularly impressive and welldesigned. Best zoo weve ever been. Maybe it was in August and all the Parisians are out for holidays. The zoo was very quiet to visit on a Sunday. Out little one really enjoyed the flat and easy walk in the park. The animals were glassed for better observation for the little ones. Appreciate the design. The feeding sessions of the sea lion was interactive as well. Overall, we had great time!
If you have young child, I would suggest you bring them in a sling rather than push a pram.  It will allow more flexibility! This zoo is wonderful. Excellent layout and the enclosures are large with several animals living together. Interesting animals and birds. The tropical house was really great. Our toddler loved running around here for a few hours. Great place to safely spend a few hours with kids and have access to lots of toiletsbaby change and foodwater outlets. We didnt really encounter any staff aside from the ticket seller who was nice enough. One of the most beautiful zoos I have seen. A huge plus is the single path that makes it hard to get lost. The park looks very wellmaintained. We spent 45 hours there. I would gladly go there again. Absolutely do not recommend you going here if you like animals
Its bizarre the little space and conditions these animals are placed in. They shouldnt be in any zoo, in the first place.
Lets please stop supporting zoos of any sort. Its time we evolve! Let the species be where they belong.
These places are all about making money and zero about animal care  protection although they claim it to be!!!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM

Square des Batignolles,"144bis Rue Cardinet, 75017 Paris, France",4.5,48.8875,2.3164794,"An absolute dream!  Full disclosure, I love ducks and wildlife, especially when in different countries so that makes this right up my alley.  This part does not allow dogs because they have a variety of ducks that hang around.  The atmosphere is great, it's a smaller park and most people were enjoying a casual lunch on a bench.  It was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city. Square des Batignolles is a beautiful city park to walk, hike and run in Paris.

The Adventures of Ronald Tintin, The Diary of Sublima and Super Professeur recommend this nice place. This park is very special and I love the little river running through it and all the different plants and flowers  almost as pretty as a Monet painting! I am from USA but have had the great fortune to travel a lot. In all my travels this is the best family park I have ever seen!!! If I lived here I would sit here for a while every night!  So may wonderful families, old, young, children, everyone!! Such a lovely place to spend some time. Not the biggest one but it is so peaceful, a lot of benchs to sit and a kids park.

Jardin des Serres d’auteuil,"3 Av. de la Prte d'Auteuil, 75016 Paris, France",4.6,48.8463076,2.2521865,"Spent two weeks here for the Olympics,  this was my favorite stop!  Best botanical gardens I've ever been to.  Just wish the signs had also been in English. The google directed entrance was blocked by an event and it will be closed until June 16. But the google directive should be fixed.  According to the instructions, after exiting metro 10 at Porte d'Auteuil, you need to take the bus to go 2 more stops and then walk.  But that is not necessary!  I followed directions and then I found out it was stupid.
After exiting metro 10 exit Bd de Murat and on the ground until, look to your right  cross the street and that's the other entrance to the park, very close and convenient.

I arrived after 5pm and the greenhouses were all closed this doesn't update the system.  You should arrive before 4pm to be able to visit the greenhouse because it is obviously the special thing about this garden.

Other than that I found the park not very special compared to other parks in Paris.  It is like a garden next to the house, not necessarily beautiful and special to the point of becoming a famous tourist destination.  And it's on the edge of Paris, so it takes a while to get around.  If you are nearby, you can stop by and go for a walk or sunbathe. Such a cool place! I loved the ponds and running water. They even have fish and parakeets! So many interesting plants to see, so many greenhouses. After the crowds and noise of the city this felt like such a wonderful escape. Id highly recommend!! Just gorgeous. A bit dilapidated, perhaps, but that only enhances the whimsy. By far one of my favorite green spaces in Paris, helped by the fact that its out of the way enough to be both expansive and peaceful. If youre lucky you might even get misted  Excellent. Vast array of plants from across the world,  some lovely koi carp and huge south american fish. Most of the greenhouses were open, and it was lovely and quiet even at midday in august! A lovely place to escape the tourist bustle. And its all free to enter! Maybe not ideal for young children as youre not supposed to touch the plants a fun family visit for us though with 2 teenagers  Sculpture exhibition on currently so worth a visit.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 6:30 PM

This summer from 9 July to 21 August. Also few more places in Paris . Follow the QR code for the information in the photo n the map Saw the Eiffel tower and all that, but my favourite part of my trip to Paris was watching the locals playing ping pong in this park. These people are seriously talented! Great place to sit with a beer and people watch! Great place to go for a swim. No cost and no queue when we were there. They opened at 1330 closed for cleaning around 3304 before opening up again. Great place to swim. Swim area has lifeguards on staff, changing rooms and showers and best of all its free.

Parc des Princes,"24 Rue du Commandant Guilbaud, 75016 Paris, France",4.6,48.8414374,2.2530504,"It has always been a dream to visit a football stadium in Europe and this brought out the child in me. From walking the halls, visiting the locker room and getting to go on the pitch, its more than one can ask for. The store made it even better. I would definitely go back and I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Paris The start of the stadium tour extremely unorganised, with no set signs saying where to go, like a free for all to get in, no matter if you had pre booked.. due to the free for all, the start of the tour is extremely crowded. Once you get past the crowd the tour was good, unaccompanied around and get full access. My nephew loved it! I thought it would be a guided tour, but it ended up being a selfguided tour. Nevertheless, he was plenty impressed, especially with the changing rooms. The little video half way through in the history of the PSG was a nice touch. There were A LOT of stairs so it might not be for people with mobility issues. I don't actually know whether there were elevators. Actually really loved this tour. My daughter and husband are big soccer fans and since Messi played for PSG, of course we had to go while we were in Paris. It was really cool! Coming from the US, I loved seeing what an amazing stadium they had for soccer. The grass!!! Wow!! They were prepping for a game and it was beautiful. The mascot was walking around taking pics, which was really neat. And the store! Huge! You can buy a jersey and for an extra 25Euro put your own name and number on the back. Pretty spendy, but a very unique souvenir. Definitely recommend. Coming from the UK, this was a special treat for my teenage son being a huge fan of Paris Saint Germain fc. He loved every second of it. I loved the freedom of the tour. The stadium was very impressive. Of course we had to visit the stadium shop.",no operation time,"stadium, point_of_interest, establishment"

Galerie Vivienne,"4 Rue des Petits Champs, 75002 Paris, France",4.5,48.8663533,2.3394854,"While you could describe Galerie Vivienne as a mall, the term would falsely evoke for Americans those structures which housed the Nordstroms, Sees and Barnes  Nobles of our bygone childhoods.

On the other hand a 200 year old covered passageway like Galerie Vivienne adorned with ornate iron roof and decor is something different.

It is an opportunity to stroll through shops, while imagining what old Paris was like when wealthy ladies would stroll through the passageways with their enormous bustled dresses, and they had husbands or lady servants who carry their parcels for them . There several  passages   in Paris or covered galleries that have been preserved very well and Galerie Vivienne is one of them. Its not only beautiful and charming, it also hosts a cohort of little shops, some stylish ones, an amazing bookstore with antique books in various languages, a great cafe to eat a lovely lunch or just great sorbet. This historic covered passage and shopping arcade is a must visit while you are in Paris. Located in the second arrondissement, this passage has beautiful mosaic floor and covered with glass ceilings.

Visiting this galerie can especially be a great alternative if you have to spend a rainy or hot day in Paris. There are plenty of options inside, including a variety of restaurants offering gourmet food and cafes. The passage is also adorned with interesting decorative designs and sculptures. Its considered as one of the most glamorous covered passages in Paris, a Pompeian style masterpiece!

Besides the art galleries, fashion boutiques, and wine tasting, should make special mention of the bookstore it houses  Jousseame, originally called Librariere PetitSiroux, one of the original tenants of this passage.

You should plan on spending at least a few hours in this passage, if not longer to take in the history, architecture, and everything else it has to offer, besides perhaps relaxing at a restaurant or caf. A beautiful place with shops where you can buy things like clothes, souvenirs, pastries, etc. It's like a small mall. I love the dome and the corridor. Galerie Vivienne in France is a captivating destination that transports you to a bygone era of elegance and sophistication. As you wander through its enchanting passages, you're surrounded by a curated selection of boutique shops, charming cafes, and artisanal galleries. The architecture is simply breathtaking, with ornate details and glass ceilings that fill the space with natural light. It's a haven for lovers of art, culture, and history, offering a unique blend of oldworld charm and modernday allure. Whether you're browsing for treasures, enjoying a leisurely stroll, or savoring a cup of coffee amidst the picturesque surroundings, Galerie Vivienne is a mustvisit gem in the heart of France.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 8:00 PM

Another interesting and also free amenity is the Glasswalk, located on the third floor. You need to register there and get a time slot to access it. Really beautiful ceiling supported by  beautiful walls around several premium brand shops to give you the ultimate experience.
Easy to access by metro and bus.
To take pictures through glass passage leading to centre, you need to pay a fees and brave the queues. This place is not for the faint of heart. The are  only two prices on everything.... Insolvency or Bankruptcy. Okay just a bit of humor but it's an amazing place to visit. You will see every major designer possible displaying their goods. The selection is amazing. There are little unique cafes on every floor. Do check out the different buildings and get to the rooftop  for a great view of Paris. Huge building with all the luxury brands, rooftop with the view over the city, its simply a must if you are there and you have 2030 minutes time just to go through.
You can also get some nice photos on the top. Great department store in Paris. The dome was beautiful. I was glad to see lots of merchandise from a variety of prices. The store did get quite busy visited on weekend. I will hopefully be returning, eager for more.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:30 PM

Italie 2,"30 Av. d'Italie, 75013 Paris, France",4,48.8303381,2.3551844,"Very large up scale department  store. Restroom didn't open until 10am and there was a charge to use. I didn't have any Euros on me but it accepted my credit card. Cost me 87 cents, and very clean. Lady attendant was upset w me because I took pictures. She said I was trying to get her fired. I love this mall. It has so many shops and nice stores. Its in the middle of 13eme arrondissement in Paris, close to metro station and has a parking lot. It's quite surprising that this shopping center has managed to secure four stars. In my opinion, a more accurate rating would be around 2.5 stars. It's a bit of a letdown, to be honest.
I moved from the US  CA to Paris. I expected to see something different in the city of light, fashion, and beauty. Instead, it was a ""meh""! It reminded me of these desert outlets in the US, but the difference is that this mall structure and lighting need a lot of help. If you expect to go to this mall to have fun with your friends, forget it because how it is designed is depressing, to say the least, with three floors and escalators that can hardly be found. And the shops are like something from the 1990s!! And what's up with Zara women? What's up with their fashion selections in France? I lived in Portugal for a year and visited Spain Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla.. . Zara offers excellent fashion selections in both countries, so why not in France? Someone has to say something because this Zara in this mall and others in France are the shallow versions of any Zara I have visited or shopped before.
One of the biggest surprises for me was the limited brand offerings at Sephora. I've never been particularly interested in their own brand, and yet, it seems to dominate the store. It's a bit baffling, to be honest.
Also, don't drive to this mall, or you will end up with 12 for 3 hours. This alone explains why this mall hardly has any customers and is almost empty during the week. Liked this mall a lot. They had lots of shops but not much of a variety so don't know how well its suited to tourists. Mostly clothes shops but we did find a shop that reminded us of Tiger. It had miscellaneous items ranging from stationary to bottles to candles. Would recommend Very strict security at entrance and throughout the Mall, English extremely limited, very difficult for visitors... Everything in French... Good luck in getting around and understanding labels... Some familiar international franchises..","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Take your coffee, book, laptop or music in the ear and enjoy them at recreation zone of the passage. There are a lot of trees and comfortable arm chairs under them here. Amazing to have something like this inside the crowded city Great to have a place like this at the station. There are some great establishment for dining with drinks. Loved walking through this off the beaten track passage! I found the perfect gift for a friend at Nature et Dcouvertes, a very friendly home goods shop. Definitely worth a detour!

베아슈베 백화점,"36 Rue de la Verrerie, 75004 Paris, France",3.6,48.8577518,2.3539077,"BHV Homme store for men. Lots of nice clothing brands Kenzo, De Fursac, Hugo Boss, Galeries Lafayette etc.. Perfumes, jewelry... Access to this store on the rue du Temple side has a courtyard called ""blue courtyard"" is quite nice also you can relax there while enjoying a coffee, a beer... while nibbling on cakes, waffles, or even hamburgers. The staff of this 4,500 m2 store are quite welcoming and competent. It's a great place to purchase Frenchmade accessories. Clothing is rarely made in France, but American and British products are common Tax refunds are available, but you must purchase more than a certain amount, so keep this in mind when shopping. Calculation is based on the basement 1 floor tools and accessories, lighting, lighting, etc., excluding the clothing and fashion floor. Instead of having to carry items from furniture and accessory stores separately to the checkout counter, you can put them all together in a shopping cart that you drag on the floor and pay at any checkout counter. But if you say you want to pay for clothes and other props at the same time, they say yes. It seems to be a country of trust. They say there's no problem as long as you don't go out the door. Tax refund is done in a small area between the 1st floor and the first basement floor, but you have to request basic receipts and tax refund paper to write down information at the cash register. And don't go through the trouble of going to the Mariage Freres store, which is quite far from Beacheve, and come here. They sell Mariage Frere and Kusumi Tea in the grocery store actually, they were also at the airport..., so it would be a good idea to buy them here while getting a tax refund. The Beashube staff basically doesn't speak English, so if you need anything, please take a picture and show it. Thanks to the truly friendly staff, this is my fifth visit to Beashbeman. Next time I go to Paris, I will go to Beacheve again.

If anyone, like me, stops by here to set up a Maison Objet booth, I would like to give you this tip. We provide free shipping from here to the hotel, so dont just take it away. You can even specify the date, so I guess it was the 6th floor... the floor where doorknob decorations and such were sold... You can talk about it there. The furniture I requested delivery included one shoe rack, one iron table, two iron chairs, and other miscellaneous lighting and parts. I hope it was helpful BHV homme, multibrand department store.

Samaritaine,"9 R. de la Monnaie, 75001 Paris, France",4.4,48.8594088,2.3424653,"I love how spacious the shopping mall is! Its massive, offering a wide variety of brands, including exclusive Olympic merchandise. The sales associates were incredibly kind and even helped me wrap my purchase as a souvenir for my loved ones back home. The packaging is super classyI'm so impressed! I'll definitely be returning! This is not a department store, its my wealthy friends bedroom, a rooftop restaurant that can transport one to the south of France, a 60s living room with TVs that broadcast from the 1960s.  Service is impeccable.

The history of the department store has unique early 1800s roots where the founder sold women Tshirts across from the mens market on the River Siene where the store is today.  He married a lady from La Marche, the other big store in town.  They never had kids but treated their employees like family.  The creator of the Eiffel Tower made the exposed internal framing. He gave much to the community and they bestowed the nickname Samaritaine to him for his good deeds.  Thank you Richard from Mauritius at the store for the kind knowledge.

Bought by LVMH and reopened 3 years ago after decade long renovation. Huge, impressive, luxurious and therefore not for everyone, or more to the point probably for those with deep pockets indeed.
I was looking for a shirt made of corduroy and this is the only item of the kind I found look at the picture.
Unfortunately not for my pay grade. A posh department store that has been under wraps for a long time, a very impressive structure with its use of steel and glass, the interior is absolutely stunning, and with a trip up to the roof area, whilst browsing the many floors of high end brands. The smallest department store in Paris is just nice for a quick browse and filled with beautiful things you want to see and touch but not necessarily buy because there isnt 20 salesperson hounding you the moment you walk in. The Veuve Cliquot counter has many special items thatll be a nice souvenir and the staff are SUPER friendly.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Great mall, a bit tricky parking the roads are too narrow The store there the service seams like they dont want to serve us Nice little shopping center. Has a really large convenience store with rows upon rows of spices, canned stuff, drinks, meats, biscuits, and pretty much all you'd need to buy.

There's also a cool fish shop, a medical wing with a pharmacy, a dentist cabinet, and more, some clothing shops, and a handful of bars and restaurants.

It's on the small side for a mall imo, but it still packs quite a lot. Really big shopping centre or really small mall.

Le charme parisien des passages couverts,"Rue du Bouloi, 75001 Paris, France",4.8,48.86307969999999,2.3397798,"Nice old Arcades Very beautiful Parisian passage with a certain charm and a neoclassical atmosphere. Passages created in the 19th century, with the main characteristics of being covered by glass roofs letting in daylight while sheltering traders, customers and suppliers from bad weather mainly located in the central districts of Paris

Some are absolutely beautiful, with refined interior decoration and a floor covered in mosaics, benefiting from good maintenance while others, more popular, are less frequented and abandoned. Some seem a little disordered like the Passage des Panoramas, but are full of restaurant terraces with various cuisines worth trying if only for the cachet of the decor and the cuisine that you don't necessarily find elsewhere . Others, without being temples of luxury, are rather well maintained and famous for some of their boutiques and their proximity to picturesque places, such as the Jouffroy passage, where the exit to the Grvin museum is located replicas of celebrities in wax. and toy and souvenir shops La Bote  Joujoux or old book bookstores. Others house rather luxurious artisanal businesses like the Vro Dodat gallery, close to the Ministry of Culture and the Louvre Museum. And also, the gallery having been occupied by the JouClub stores, next to Tte Dans Les Nuages , on the Boulevards des Italians...

Most of these covered passages are passable by wheelchair or with a stroller, but be careful of the crowds, especially where there are restaurant terraces facing each other! And the middle of the Jouffroy passage, with a staircase, to be avoided if you are in the cases mentioned above Small shops that are linked together, sheltered from everything. A downside, there are too many catering options, no connection with the place. Especially not to be missed if you pass nearby...","Monday: 9:00 AM – 7:30 PM

Amazing deals to shop for discounted high brands items. The location itself is very pretty, like a small village. They have restaurants as well for people who need a break to rest. It was rainy when we went but still we were able to look around and shop. I have recently visited the La Vallee Village on  29th of September. We have to cross the commercial shopping centre in order to reach the La vallee village. All the luxurious brands under one roof. The village is so elegantly designed that anyone who visits will be awestruck. Few brands like Timberland, Tissot, Diesel, Armani and few others are worth shopping for as the prices are discounted when compared to outside stores. Even I have purchased for myself from the above brands.
We were not allowed inside few stores like Gucci and Dior, the staff asked for an appointment to enter the store. Which, I personally felt offended and didnt like it.
We tourists come from different countries to spend thousands of euros and dont get the respect which we deserve.

La vallee village closes by 6pm, so plan your day accordingly. You can reach the place by taking a Metro and RER from the city.
This place is a worth visit if you are in Paris.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Very poor customer service. I bought a dress here yesterday, but didn't try it as I had my two month old baby with me. When I got home, it unfortunately wasn't the right fit, and on top of it, I hadn't realised that the buttons were ""false buttons"". I understand that you can have a no returnno exchange policy for an outlet like the one on display now, but I am surprised of the lack of flexibility the staff in fact the manager showed. I explained my circumstances  I only just bought the dress yesterday afternoon and came back today  I suggested I would change it to something more expensive I would of course pay the difference. Not only was the manager completely inflexible to making an exception, but she was also nonchalant and with little sense of customer service. I like this store, but have often felt the lack of customer service here. Today's experience makes me want to stop coming to this store all together. They sell beautiful clothes, but as a customer, you don't feel in particularly good and welcoming hands. It's a shame. Ordered 500 worth of products  late delivery as shop renovating. More than 6 weeks later I had to return some products and management was extremely helpful and lenient. Would highly recommend, quality of delivered goods on apr with excellent service You should visit. Read. Enjoy each piece. They did the hard work for all of us. Good select stores, pretty good brands although the selection is a bit too eurocentric and thus not unique in Paris. Staff is very friendly  Okay. Cute store with great clothes, BUT they do NOT take care of there clothes we bought white shoes and they had scuffs on them. We also bought a sher skirt and it was stretched out from being on the hanger. I asked for a larger size in a dress and they brought it up to me and it was insanely wrinkled to the point where I cant tell if it was cute or not. I prob would have spent 500 more there but I was so mad about all the clothes being mistreated, I took photos of the brands and am planning on buying them online.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:00 PM

There is a cute shop read expensive and a cafe which was my favourite!
The shop had a lot of souvenirs and a nice place to take pictures. My friend bought a cute bag and the interior was beautiful. If you want expensive souvenirs best place to go! The cafe was covered with books gave a very antique beautiful vibe! This is my shop of dreams! Treated myself to a linen duvet cover set and metallic leather purse. Im actually in love. Just such an inspirational joyous shop  It was nice to visit there in general. Sometimes, you dont have to behave too generously to be kind. They had lots of collaborations and some of the Japanese brands were there! Fabulous store in marais with a fine selection of designer apparel, accessories and furniture. Fun and unique store. Maybe differing things to buy. It's on the expensive side, but it seems worth it.","Monday: 10:30 AM – 7:30 PM

앙팡루즈시장,"37 Rue Charlot, 75003 Paris, France",4.5,48.8627249,2.3622569,"Great place to have artisans food! Small island in Paris. Amazing sandwich ever! It's nice to take a quick look around the traditional market. An area I visited by chance I heard that a lot of Parisians go here, so I was curious and visited. There wasn't much to eat, and the watermelon juice was as big as I wanted, but I regret paying 8,000 won for it. Of course, it's fresh fruit, so it's delicious, but the quantity is small, and it's a bit expensive, so... I think it's best to just come and have a look. It is said to be a traditional market with a history of over 400 years, located in the Marais district. I found this place by chance while passing by, and when I searched it on Naver, I found out that it was a famous place. The market is very small in size and has a few flower, vegetable, fish, dairy, etc. stores and many restaurants. The stores are small but neat. I personally enjoyed the lunch box menu at the Japanese restaurant that singer Jaehyung Jeong frequented while studying in Paris, so I recommend it. The most famous one seems to be the sandwich shop. It's been around a long time and is famous enough to be featured on TV, so the lines are long during meal times. You have to make only the seasoned food you ordered very slowly and choose the ingredients, and because of the process of melting the cheese, you have to wait in line for a very long time. It costs around 9 euros, and you need to choose well the ham and cheese to save less. Because it is large, it is good for 23 people to share and taste it. Personal opinion that it is a bit salty and not very tasty. Still, it's worth trying at least once and it's fun to look around. Still, I really enjoyed visiting the markets in Paris. It seems like most places close around 34pm, so make sure to check the time.

There are a variety of international foods so good that you'll want to try them all, so I recommend going there for a meal.

Oh, and the Paris strawberries are really delicious. Be sure to eat it","Monday: Closed

The staff is friendly and provides excellent service, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. If youre looking for Longchamp products, this store is definitely a great choice! I went there to buy a bag for my mum as a gift, and it was a top notch experience. The place is comfy, and the sales associates are extremely friendly. I would especially want to say thank you to one of the sales Alphonse. He gave me a lot of helpas I knew almost nothing about bags, and explained super clearly on how to clean the bag, the special thing about the product, and so on. Such enthusiasm and professionalism from him really brightened my day! Longchamp on Champslyses, is the best store on the road. Massive selection on 2 flourishing floors, multiple colors, and a large assortment of style selections. Purses galore! The staff was excellent! I want to give a shout out to Jeremy, who was astonishing with customer service and helpful beyond all measures. He was incredibly wonderful, super attentive, and made sure our shopping experience was nothing short of extraordinary! Although the sales associate was so kind he gave me the wrong size of the bag that I was originally buying. I was about to buy the medium size and he offered me to give the bag that is boxed which is actually thoughtful thing. Given that I wouldnt expect that he couldve gave the wrong size, I didnt open it and check. Today, I opened the box and guess what! I have the LARGE size, which WAS NOT the one I was buying, and now I dont have any chance to change it because I live in Istanbul. SO, a recommendation to each one of you check the size of the bag even if it is boxed to dont be fooled like me. Always have to visit Long Champ when in Paris! The store is crowded but still managed to get an SA! SA was very friendly and helpful. Showed me quite a number of designs but was looking for specific ones.

My sisters Long Champ bag had some stains, he even got his senior to look at it. End up they cleaned the whole bag and managed to remove the stains.

Definitely will go back again.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Chanel,"31 Rue Cambon, 75001 Paris, France",4.3,48.868201,2.326632,"Dream come true visiting this location and getting my dream bag  My sales associate was super sweet and made sure I got the bag that I was looking for. There was a lot of selection, I was brought upstairs and there was even more.

I arrived 10 minutes before they opened and was let in right away. Although, I am more used to them offering me drinks, but this time around I had to ask because they never did which I didnt mind but it was the first time at a Chanel location where they werent of service. But because my SA was busy finding the perfect bag for me, I completely understand.

Overall, great experience. Made my Paris trip extra memorable. It has been my dream to visit 31 Rue Cambon! Im visiting from Sydney Australia and the team at this boutique did not disappoint! Veronique was my sales associate who went above and beyond and was so lovely to work with. Everyone from the host, sales associates and the person who helps with your tax refund are all so pleasant and seamless at their jobs. Super impressed especially since I visited on a day a new collection launched. Truely a well oiled machine! Keep up the great work  I wanted to visit the original Chanel store during this my first trip to Paris.  I wanted to walk in the neighborhood of Coco Chanel, whose home was  still is above this store.  I was glad to be here to see they have expanded to 29 Rue Cambon as well.  Lovely, and grand store inside with a beautiful accessory selection.  Located at 31 Rue Cambon, Paris Pretty sure they tell everyone there are 13 people ahead of you on the wait list because after about 15 minutes we were now second but it still took another 30 or so minutes to be served.

They had a very large selection of bags which my wife loved.

The purchasing experience was pretty good and the sales people were quite well equipped to answer my questions regarding my VAT refund. As a New Yorker visiting Paris, stepping into the Chanel 31 rue Cambon store was a dream come true, culminating in a memorable purchase of my first Chanel bag. The experience was elevated to sheer perfection by the impeccable service of Anais, my delightful sales associate.

From the moment I entered, Anais greeted me warmly and made me feel immediately at ease. She exuded a genuine enthusiasm for Chanel's products and took the time to understand my preferences. As we discussed various options, Anais offered me a glass of champagne and delicate macaroons, adding a touch of French elegance to the shopping experience.

What impressed me most was Anais's patience and dedication. She patiently allowed me to try on several pairs of shoes, providing insightful recommendations and ensuring each fit was perfect. When it came to selecting my Chanel bag, she went above and beyond to locate the exact one I had my heart set on, making sure every detail was just right.

Anais's exceptional service extended beyond mere assistance she shared her deep knowledge of Chanel's history and craftsmanship, enriching my understanding of the brand. Her genuine passion for fashion and dedication to customer satisfaction were truly commendable.

Leaving the store with my beautifully wrapped Chanel bag, I knew I had experienced something extraordinary. Anais's professionalism, kindness, and attention to detail made this a shopping trip I will never forget. My visit to Chanel 31 rue Cambon was not just about acquiring a luxury item it was an unforgettable journey guided by Anais's exceptional service.

Without a doubt, I will be back, eager to explore more of Chanel's offerings with Anais's expert guidance. She is a true asset to the Chanel team and exemplifies the epitome of outstanding customer service.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Chanel,"21 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, 75008 Paris, France",4.1,48.868801,2.3212916,"I visited this chanel boutique on my last trip to Paris which was last Tuesday on the 20th of August 2024. I was looking for shoes the SA was okay at the beginning, later on I decided to take the shoes, she asked if i can them with no box but i refused because me paying this much amount of money therefore, I need everything to look perfect. Anyway, I paid and left but never got the chance to check them out at the hotel. After getting back home, I unboxed it and was super surprised where the shoes are on the box with no shape keeper, dust bag and not even properly packed. If I was still on Paris definitely I will go back to the store but unfortunately I left. I had the worst shopping experience among all lux brands ive purchased from. the SA Armelle was nice on the surface but super nasty the moment i went back to the shop highlighting defects about my bag. Please dont get too excited buying your bag in the moment and check your bag properly before leaving. How can a classic Chanel yellow leather start flaking off and showing white from one use? Anyway, the discolouration of the straps was not what i expected from Chanel. Anouch was the repair staff who tried to fix the problem and they actually admitted the defect after their experts assessed it. In the end they changed the whole bag for me one for one and i got the Black Caviar Classic and returned the yellow bag. So much for SA Armelle talking over me when im trying to explain it was so frustrating. Also she was insistent that its because i used the bag so i wont get it exchanged, but how would i know it is faulty until it is used? Light usage  leather flaking out is not normal at all. I guess she just wanted to get things done fastest by shrinking all responsibility and get defensive. We could have resolved it much faster if not for her unnecessary comments. The collection has cute colours but the SA not so cute in their service  Went there last November 1, around the store opening 11am. Glad they were open that day. It wasn't crowded. The model looking, Kevin, helped my wife shop for her favorite bag, shoes and sun glasses. Kevin was really helpful, kind and patient. So look for him whenever you visit the store he has a 7star rating from us! Thank you Kevin! Of course its chanel, staff is semi friendly . Could be better, they should provide more seating while shopping since you are standing for more than 1 hr Visited this Chanel boutique during our Paris trip. After quickly figuring out my style, the SA went to a cabinet and found this perfect beauty for me. The SA Nicole, if Im remembering correctly that helped me was very sweet and kind.

I had an appointment for the following day I visited, but popped in the day before as a walkin with no issues. Ive shopped at many Chanel boutiques and this one was phenomenal with selection and service ","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

I wanted to find a clothe which I saw in London then she brought me a look book, found together. And I wanted to compare some different design and colour, she recommended well. Great friendly service. Thank you for sourcing my A.P.C bag for me from another store. I love it so much!

Store staffs were very gentle and friendly in my last visit. I specially recommend Heidi, that girl is a gem of a person. Thank you.

Will visit again. The best service you can ask for.
The staff are very professional and nice
They provided us with the most memorable experience we can ask for  Great clothes. High quality, are classic. The sales are excellent. My Saint James sweaters have NEVER pilled. The store is quite small. This store, and Rebecca with her colleagues are amazing Im impressed with their service which is sweet and have a good sense. Of course they gave me appropriate recommendations didnt push me to buy. Even thought I took many hours to decide, they didnt show their tiring with that lot of shoppers were in there, they handled to make each costumers are satisfied. Im sure that the owner must keep them to dont quit, if shehe let them to do, it means you miss your lottery

Thank you Rebecca and all. Thanks to you, I could have a good experience with Saint James in Paris ! Take care of this place. Theyre is a no return policy. Even 2 days later, they would offer only store credit or exchange the 15 days return policy is supposed only for items purchased online. So I found an exchange, and even spending 60 more. But the system cant accept it?!?  So I am left with an item I dont want. And cant even pay more to return for items Id like. The staff is nice enough, but the store policy is completely inflexible and not customer focused. Id never recommend","Monday: 10:30 AM – 7:30 PM

AMI Paris - Paris Boulevard Beaumarchais,"109 Bd Beaumarchais, 75003 Paris, France",3.6,48.8606966,2.3669655,"Nice and helpful staff. Good quality. Better deal to buy direct from France than in Canada. Store was a bit small and too hot in there with only one fan on. The blond lady at this location seems to be super unhappy with her job, I assume shes the manager cause shes always there. This was my 3rd time visiting this location and shes never in a good mood.

The store does not provide refunds, they give you a voucher that you can only use at AMI standalone stores, so if you buy a gift for someone and they dont like it, youre out of money because they dont accept returns.

Meanwhile refunds are possible if you buy one of their pieces at Galeries Lafayette or at Printemps or online. Doesnt make sense

The Forever AMI program for taking back old clothes is ridiculous. They give you credit worth less than 50 of the items original price only if its in excellent condition, if its not excellent by their standards youd be lucky with 20 and they require you to dry clean it for them before?? Seems like too much of a hassle, Id rather donate the items.

For the price of their merchandise they really need to work on their customer service. This brand is really having a laugh selling sweatshirts for almost 400 made of fabric that cost no more than 10  meter , made in Moldavia, their margin is outrageous but that doesn't stop wealthy clueless people to spend their money there and think they are cool in this uniform. What a pleasant experience! Highly recommended way better than the store in Rue d'Alger One star is too much. Warning don't order from AMI eshop. They have a bad logistic and customer service. I have been chasing them since October regarding the refund of a jacket at 720. This is so disappointing. I finally decided to forward the case to a lawyer.

Very interesting considering that this is the 1st arrondissement.

Stalls of potted and not potted flowers and small plants, cooked food  chicken, sausages, etc Very noisy with many athletes who use it as a training place dance, skateboard, rollerblades
With an equally noisy freeway with its large terraces.
The passage has been closed for work for 1 year and will be closed until winter 2024 The place is unfortunately abandoned, we console ourselves by contemplating the archive photos.

In the meantime, it's a really unfriendly place. I hope it won't be left abandoned for too long because it has real potential. Who would have thought that 230 years ago a couple of madmen unleashed the reign of terror in that same place that was previously a Jacobin convent and is now a shopping center. Sometimes I imagine that Robespierre and Marat would be thinking right now.

This time we left emptyhanded. Probably THE most famous department store in Paris. Visited it many time already. Huge collection of brands for sure, but I do find the collection per brand became very limited. But i found they have a huge collection of white sneakers! Check out the video I took. Whats a nice surprise this time is that added a Restore give some old clothing a second live. But they still price them pretty high, as vintage.
Dont forget to visit their rooftop, you can see a lot of Paris. Also there is a very big restaurant on the top floor, if someone prefer to wait there while you shop. Very friendly service. Beautiful deptartment store full of luxury items.  If you are keen on vintage browsing, there are excellent used items as well.  Before Christmas, unless you really enjoy holiday decorations, probably not a place to go.

Dropped by to get sandals to use for a long flight, not a big selection but was able to find a Hoka Ora Luxe for 80 got a tax rebate too, it was US80 stateside so I guess I got a deal. The lady who assisted me said that the max size they carry is US13 so folks with larger sizes are out of luck. They had a tax refund area in the building so that was convenient. I've entered 2 wrong malls until I found this amazing dome. They should rename or more clarify this one. I could write a book on this shop. Though, Ill control myself for Google Review and just do a few lines.

In a nutshell this place is exceptional. People are quite nice and always willing to help  support you in your choice.

Its maybe the only place in Paris where you can compare so many brands so easily all the best and finest brands are sold here.

You have so many choice its incredible !

Last but not least, it looks like they never close.. so convenient !

A participant many thanks again to the whole team of the shirt floor Seidensticker, Hast, Comptoir GL, for their time and advice ! This is the most beautiful shopping mall I've ever seen!  I visited at Christmas time, and the decorations were super cool.

Inside the main bldg, there was a fiber optic light show, every 30 minutes.  It was in the dome above, surrounding the Christmas tree, and featured dancing bumble bees.  The mall itself is 6 or 7 levels high, is positioned along all 4 corners of a major intersection, and includes tons of regular name and high end department stores, for shopping.

MUST SEEDO, WHEN IN PARIS! Like always.

Maison Goyard,"233 Rue Saint-Honoré, 75001 Paris, France",3.6,48.8663828,2.3288172,"My husband and I were staying down the street from this Maison Goyard location on our recent trip to Paris. After breakfast, we walked over prior to opening around 945am on a weekday and were third in line. Upon opening at 1000am, we were escorted into the store and quickly met with a very kind SA. We were interested in only 12 bag models and they promptly brought them to us to view and try on. I now understand why they only let in a certain number of customers at one time and this is clearly so they can match up with one sales associate at a time. I ended up not making a purchase however enjoyed the experience and would recommend lining up at this location shortly before opening to avoid a long wait, prepared with a list of models you would like to view to assist the sales associates as they have to go to the back to select the items from their inventory. Would recommend to anyone seeking this specific designer in Paris. I went to this location 2 separate times and had completely different experiences both times. The first time I went, I got in right away because I had an appointment. The SA we were paired with was quite rude and dismissive. He disappeared for 10 minutes and randomly came back. I think because of this we werent able to buy everything we wanted which is why we ended up having to visit a second time.

The second visit, we didnt have an appointment and arrived 10 minutes before the store opened. There was still a line, despite arriving earlier and we ended up waiting about an hour to get in. The SA we were paired with was such a sweetheart and went above and beyond. We told him what we wanted and he showed us options that we didnt even know were options. We had fun conversations that were short and sweet and a successful shopping trip.

Overall thoughts is that your experience will basically be based off of luck. How long you wait on line depends on how long the customers inside take which is why I recommend making an appointment and your shopping experience depends on who your sales associate is. Okay... I know there will be about 1 hour wait, if you do not have an appointment,  but if you are going to get a Goyard item, especially if it is the first time... go to 233 Rue Saint Honore. You've got to. It is an experience, and I love their original store.  The salespeople are friendly and accommodating. They answered every question and requests with patience and a smile. It was so effective that we ended up buying two bags instead of the planned one. If you are visiting, they will help with the tax paperwork and will explain what you need to do. Well well well, as with every Goyard store theres always a line to get in, so you cant complain. The man at the door was polite and was attentive. He gave everyone umbrellas when it rained whilst in the line. Our wait was about one hour, and maybe 20 people were ahead of us? Long wait but it is what it is.

Once inside we were greeted by a sales assistant who asked what we wanted to get or curious about in their stock and was immediately shown to where we can choose. I didnt catch the ladys name but she was polite, very patient whilst making a decision and we didnt feel pressured or rushed to make a decision.

My cousin was happy with her purchase and will definitely come back if we ever visit Paris again Extremely poor service. I went in and politely asked for the bags I wanted, but the sales assistant looked annoyed and unwilling to help. When I asked for more bags, she immediately asked if I wanted anything else so she could bring them all at once. I have never encountered someone so unwilling to serve their customers. In contrast, my sales associate at Chanel is always eager to show me something fascinating, even when I mention that I'm not looking to purchase anything that day. Overall, the service at Goyard is unacceptable.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

The sales were very professional and knowledgeable, providing excellent customer service. I found the perfect bag I had been searching for, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The entire process was smooth and enjoyable, leaving me very pleased with my choice to shop at FLP. Highly recommended! Thanks to Kristiana for helping me getting my dream bag. She was very gentle and patient. I got  daily battle 32 zippe, and its been amazing carrying my stuff esp for work. Going to work with fashion i should say! I had been eyeing this brand for years but still indecisive to purchase bags from FLP until I visited this place. And I am so happy with Kristiana in particular during my visit in this FLP boutique because she helped me to find what kind of bag that I really need or I can say to find the perfect bag for my daily routine She asked me about my preferences in color, long term wear, and daily fashion style. She also knows very well about the knowledge of the brand materials, models, seasons etc which made me easier to find the bag I need. I got my first daily battle during my visit and will definitely come back to purchase another in the future. I recommend you to purchase the daily battle bags because the handles are adjustable! They also come in many sizes and colors. The bags also are also easy to style! I have been carrying this bag everyday since the day I bought it. Had a great shopping experience ! Staff were helpful and professional, especially Kristiana was very nice and also she provided me lots of information and advice. Thanks a lot !! Had an absolutely amazing experience at FLP!! I had a few items I knew I wanted to see, and the sales associate was quick to show them to me and kindly answered all of my questions. I never felt rushed or pressured while thinking through my decision. The manager kindly offered us water while we were shopping, and helped answer a few VAT questions at the end.

Cafe in the store with drinks and cakes, also few small food bar but doesnt seem to be open during the visit. Some deli food for takeaway or eat in store at the designated area. Huge selection, premium brands and everyday delights. You pay more but it's all there, beautifully presented. They vacuum pack your butter for international travel. A grocery store worth checking out. Bought butter and mustard to take home and had it vacuum sealed in the store. So many things Id have loved to take home with me if not the limited space in my suitcase.
This brand of mustard was one of my favorites and the flavor is very subtle. Just as it should be. Best store Ive been to in my life! Cannot wait to go back. They have the best desserts. Still dream about this grocery store to this day! Also a good place to buy chocolate souvenirs. It is one hour from the cdg airport to come here if you take a cab. Which I took g7 taxi over at 12pm. I choose this particular store as is closer to the route to the Louvre.

I love this grocery mall which has eatery and it is a few storey high. I came here to get butter and pate. It has so many things which I would love to spend more time in and has a meal there.

The cashier is so nice and helpful with my not so fluent French in asking for the toilet and also to have my butter vacuum pack for flying. It is one euro to have my 6 butter vacuum packed.

It is food haven in this place. I really enjoy this place.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 9:00 PM

When I saw the rooftop terrace signs I had to investigate and wow I was not disappointed.  Great service and beautiful views and of course I had to try the new Veuve Cliquot RICH a lighter sweeter taste than the classic and refreshingly served with a round block of ice too.
Just a magical shopping experience overall. Thank you. beautiful place to shop specially in Christmas season at night they have a magnificent display on the window that tourist can take Photo. very lovely My favorite department store..I like it more than other departments stores in the area ...I don't know why but I feel more relaxed there...usually I find there what I am looking for especially for perfumes, ladies handbags and kids fashion...I also enjoy having a break and drink some coffee at the coffee shop on the ground floor..

Just like other department stores,  printemps devided into 3 building each have a round 5 levels..each floor will have different products..

Chocolate, bags, men and women fashion,,all is available there Its always amazing to come back at this place and check out the finest fashion in the world. Everything so beautiful and organized. Hope to come back again. This is my favorite location in Paris

CELINE PARIS SAMARITAINE LEATHER GOODS,"19 R. de la Monnaie, 75001 Paris, France",4.3,48.859223,2.341955,"Bad customer service and cheap quality products. I bought a triomphe belt from Cline. The hardware of the buckle changed color. I went to the customer service to have it repared  as it was under waranty, they told me that they cannot repare it for free and I would need to pay 100 euros to change the buckle as they only repare manufacturing issues and not scratches. I shared some pictures of the belt showing that the color worn out so this is clearly a cheap production. Dont waist your money here. I have belts from reputable brands like gucci and feraggamo. I bought them 8 and 6 years ago the quality is excellent. My advise Dont waist 500 euros on a cheap quality belt with a scam client service. Wonderful little boutique.  The staff here was incredibly helpful,  welcoming and kind.  Amazing experience! Would love to go back.  Will enjoy my souvenir for years to come. Had very pleasure shopping here with best SA Richard . He is very professional and nice , and tries to find the best deal for me.  will definitely come back here again for shopping. Above and beyond service provided by Udval  My purse was stolen and lost all the receipt and tax refund, and she was able to help out even though I initially didnt purchase from her. She walked me through the procedure patiently too, super nice and kind person. The sales associate who attended to me was very nice, but the one who handled the tax refund form was extremely rude. When I asked her some questions about the tax refund, she responded bluntly that her only job was to issue the tax refund form, and anything else was my own problem, not her responsibility.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

However, not all the available items were on the racks. We had to ask if they have several items which theyve had them. Shopping   Heaven  Superb experience with the seller Anthony who has a nice southern accent who is helpful and attentive. I recommend this seller who gives very good advice. I would come back with great pleasure Everyone I met in Paris was friendly, but is the store employee here annoying all the customers? It seemed like I was seeing it as Seller more than unpleasant, looks very bad and totally unavailable.
I didn't even get a hello.
I came for a specific purchase but the seller seemed annoyed when I asked to compare 2 sizes. He leaves me to chat with a colleague from the stand opposite and some tourists whom a saleswoman was already taking care of.
The tshirt came out of stock, he puts it on the table and looks at me with a look telling me to manage, so I take it out of the bag and unfold the tshirt myself in order to make the comparison.
When my choice is made, he sighs, as if finally.
I absolutely do not recommend the store and even the staff who, according to the comments, seem to be known for their nonchalance.

Louis Vuitton Maison Vendôme,"2 Pl. Vendôme, 75001 Paris, France",4.2,48.8666749,2.3288837,"This was our first time in Paris and obviously we had to go to Louis Vuitton to shop.

We loved our shopping experience. We reached there around 1pm on Monday afternoon and there no wait to enter the store.

Folks recommended this store as the store near Arc de Triomphe usually had 45 mins to 1 hr wait to enter the store.

We ended up buying a bag, belt and shoes and we loved everything. It is an absolutely gorgeous store in a great part of Paris.

I was assisted by a great SA, Morgan at Maison Vendome she was so helpful. She showed me dozens of bags, shoes, wallets what she didnt have in stock she looked up for me and told me where I could get it.

BEST LV EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!! And I love my new bag! Spacious two floor Louis Vuitton Shop with large selection of LV items most of the staff were very helpful
But we had a bad experience with two ladies and their behaviour.

Overall good. I simply adore this brand. Many thanks to them for their attentiveness, sensitivity, and the staff who treat their customers with great love. PierreArnaud Berry was very helpful and nice. One of the best and most beautiful boutiques. First time ever in a Louis Vuitton store. First time ever in Paris! Really enjoyed our shopping experience here! We made an appointment prior to our travel as entrance to the store is by appointment only. Our client advisor Michele was a pleasure to work with! Hes so personable and professional. He was patient with us and showed us everything we wanted to see, minus a bag that wasnt available. Yes, granted we only purchased wallets, but the client experience was superb. We were provided with champagne and our purchases wrapped in Louis boxes and bags. Michele also took care of our VAT tax refund and before we left Paris we were already credited our refund!  Michele also recommended the cutest little tea shop around the corner see my review for Ninas.

If youre in Paris and want to shop at Louis Vuitton, make your appointment at the Vendome store and request to work with Michele! He has the greatest personality! Thanks Michele!!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

CHANEL,"19 Rue Cambon, 75001 Paris, France",4.1,48.8676076,2.3260876,"Love the shopping experience here.  Sales staff was very friendly and made us feel comfortable.  She took the time to show me lots of product.  My Daughter was offered a beverage  and my Husband and I a coffee while we browse. Those shoes were on public display while walking past of it last Wednesday. We went inside and informed the stuff about it. I have to say he was very professional. But another lady went outside to take a look, made a picture and went back in... I would have immediately removed those shoes from display... One said it was maybe the heat... It is May, there is aircondition inside and the shoes were never ever worn before... I don't know if that is about the quality it should be. The stuff was handling it professional, so one star. Disappointing. Came back to purchase shoes and while the salesperson assured me they would be ready for purchase as I was rushing for the airport. When I arrived, no one knew where the shoes were. 15 minutes passed and I was told the shoes had a defect. Ultimately I lost precious time and walked out empty handed. Poor service, and even worst experience. I had a great time at this boutique. I arrived with no appointment in the morning and was immediately greeted with warm welcome and smile. I was introduced to my SA Mayumi and she was an absolutely delight.

The entire experience was smooth and Mayumi was very patient and attentive to figure out what I was after and gave great suggestions to what I may like.

During the entire time I never felt rushed but was encouraged to take my time to try on creations and to make my choice at my own pace. I was also offered beverages.

We ended up having a great conversation about Chanel, fashion and travel in general, which also felt natural.

Needless to say, this will be my go to store in Paris from now on and I will for sure be asking for Mayumi for future visits. Ines Le Floch took care of us during our visit and provided a delightful experience. We have been to many Chanel boutiques and Ines is by far the most helpful sales representative. Unlike some sales reps that are selective based on customers perceived wealth, she patiently answered our questions and is attentive throughout our engagement. We recommend any customers visiting the store to seek her help and guidance on purchasing.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

No waiting and great customer service. Nice stamps experience at the store as well. Super friendly stamp staff. Thank you for the nice experience at LV Paris. Uncomplicated Global Blue Tax Service! Rude Thai salesperson named Siriwong in the mens section on the 3rd floor is the one to avoid. She totally ruins the image of luxury brand with her cold and arrogant personality. Unlike the other LV salespersons in the others store, this person in particular has no interest in conversation. A lady who sold me a cheap croissant in the subways convenient store even impressed me more. I had submitted a complaint to the LV headquarter and yet received no feedback. So i reckon they want their LV brand to be perceived that way. Shame! Thanks to all of you buying this crazy expensive things the owner arnault  is the most billionaire whats the difference from a 200 bag to a 7000 LV just the name they very smart you just wasting your money The shop is in a great Location 

We had a very nice saleswoman.  Very friendly .
My bag was specially reordered because I didn't want an exhibition model.  Everything worked great.

Thank you LV This is the epitome of retail therapy. This amazing team would make you feel like VIP even when Im only purchasing a bottle of fragrance. From the store director to housekeeping everyone would treat you like royalty. Nonetheless, Siriwong and Arnauld  are my to go to people. They genuinely care about their customers.

The sign next to the store  online, clearly says the store closes at 830 PM. The security guard even pretended that he doesnt understand English to avoid answering why the sign says a different closing time. I also doublechecked with a male staff member that was there, who also confirmed the store was closed.

Like me, several others were turned away. I noticed in other reviews that this has happened before at this store, even closing up to 30 minutes early. So they are doing this on an ongoing basis, and not doing anything to address it. It was my first night in Paris, and I needed a charging adapter, which they sell, in order to be able to charge any of my devices, and unfortunately, I relied on the stores stated closing time. No trip to Paris is complete without a visit to Fnac, a major seller of music, movies and TV on physical media and consumer electronics, including HiFi equipment. My favorite branch is the one on Avenue des Ternes. Just keep in mind you'll be paying European prices, not the usually lower Asian or American ones. Nice and practical place where you can get a powerbank and charge your Mobile so quickly while walking in Champs Elysees If you are looking for a book or for a camera or for a phone or a new laptop this is your place. They carry the major brands for Electronics . I just purchased a new camera and it wasnt in stock

Overall extremely poor level and unprofessional eshop. You will get much better service from any seveneleven supermarket.

From customer service you will receive only copy paste answers. When you send a message, the case starts always from the beginng. Looks like they use AI.

Shipping partner is UPS. NOTE! They use shipping method, where  is no option to pick up your shipment from UPS access point! You need to be home personally. As UPS inform the delivery time by the end of day so you need to be on watch whole day. Drivers have no phones either!

Shipping time 34 days on the website is not true. After more than two weeks, never received my shipment. No help from customer service, therefore I forwarded my case to the authorities and my credit card bank.

If you really want problems, feel free to order. I can NOT recommend to anyone Chinese Receptionist did not provide receipt for purchase  missed out on Golden Dior Charm when wrapping the MINI LADY DIOR WALLET that I purchased. Extremely unsatisfied with the service.

Arranged a video conference w the staff through Dior Website at GMT8 2000hrs but no staff attended the video conference too.

Is this the kind of service provided by Dior? Salesperson was unkind. Looked bored and provided the most minimal service. Maybe I needed to buy a handbag to receive better service? Unpleasant experience. Went to the Mens Dior at Samartaine and the service was very good!! Guy with the long hair was serving sorry didnt catch the name went above and beyond especially compared to other Diors where Ive had terrible service. Highly recommend.

The server recommended Ros with it, and my only complaint is that I had too much liquids and needed a sweet treat afterwards to counter
Enjoy the view! Enjoy the food! and Enjoy the ambience. This place is fantastic if you are looking for a centralized spot for high fashion. They also host a small outdoor section and are super friendly. During the holidays they go all out at have great window displays. A must for all Paris trips. Yes go to the 8th floor for the view if not for the food. The quality price ratio is average however the service lacks the personality of Printemps high quality. Often I have observed servers arent too keen and close shop earlier than closing time. Had a nice healthy carrot ginger juice however its the view I went for and Im certain you will too. Prices elevated so be prepped. So, I finally got to visit the new Printemps du Got Printemps of the taste. It reminded  me of th Grande Epicerie at the Bon March, but smaller and more formal. You can find some renowned chef or food brand such as Dubernet and Thierry Marx  you can find fine French products, and then go to the rooftop, where Akrame set up his restaurants, one specialized in fish and the other one in meat he has 3 restaurants called Atelier Vivanda in Paris.
You will find also a very good cheese seller,  and a Michalak pastry chef boutique.
We had lunch at Akrame meat. I had the burger, and my friend the tartare. I must say I prefer the Atelier Vivanda. The meat is much better. I think this place is great if you want to admire Paris from above while you eat!
But it's a place to visit. So many gourmet things to see! Its an experience in which youll find luxury wines and champagnes, french food, spices, chocolates, sweets and much more. Its a small place compared to next door. Dont expect cheap prices. You can take a drink on the terrace and enjoy the city view!","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Very pleased with my purchase as they only had one briefcase left in stock in all Paris locations.  I can see where people would be upset at the wait times given there are only 2 sales people working and 20 people in line but the one on one service is great once youre inside. The overall service is quite high standard, but it comes with an arrogant vibe, unlike other brands that feel cozier. The service was also a bit slow when packing after payment. On the plus side, you can get a tax refund in cash after receiving the receipt by going to the Printemps Tourist Service on the B floor. I was worried about  shopping here . The line was short  service was  so nice.   They packaged really nicely.  They will guide you for tax free.  Honestly I was really impressed. Bought two bags  .. with colors I wanted .

Choose and consider, the lady will have unhappy face.

Détaxe,"40 Bd Haussmann, 75008 Paris, France",3.9,48.8734166,2.3326087,"I agree with the previous comments that this is the worst tax refund place. They keep your money and they dont reply on the emails. When you send them the email again by mentioning tax federal authority , they reply immediately and put you on hold and saying just wait, we will escalate it and then disappear again.

It has been two months since I left EU. Global Blue sent me money back long time ago and huge amount compared to you.
I mentioned by email that I have the form validated by customs with the stamp, I kept my boarding pass, I can send you the stamp from my passport that I left EU and I confirmed that I did not exchange or refunded my goods. The physical form was sent by mail from the airport too.
What else do you need?

Does it mean that you want to keep money for yourself? I am sure 90 people dont follow up because they are very busy but I am for justice and honesty first of all. It should be fair, right? All brands under 1 roof Very pretty Very nice store. Full of history. We go there to walk, wander, see the view, dream, for the luckiest. Buy. For the richest. At Christmas the decorations are great! I went to the Cartier store, located in Galeries Lafayette. I was interested in a Pasha watch. A saleswoman showed me several watches, including a model with a blue sunray dial and a steel bracelet. she told me that this watch was only sold with one steel bracelet.

Don't come here if you don't have an appointment with them. They will not serve you. Kevin was our sale associate and he was professional. I came in knowing exactly which bag to get without spending much time shopping around and browsing. The line was absolutely mayhem right before 4pm and it got going  fast after 1520 mins. We had to share a station with someone since its how busy it was. We were never offered water but I asked for it since it completes the shopping experience. He brought it right out and never lost his cool despair how busy it was. They did have a problem with the card processing for global blue refunds and took a while to figure out.

She told me Never full MM was not available and she showed me other models that I did not like.  She did not show any interest in serving me and my friend.  When she knew that I only wanted to purchase just the speedy 25, she became even more rude.  She threw the pen and receipt towards a tray of used glasses of other customers in front of me and asked me to sign on the receipt. After wrapping up my bag, she put it on the table and left without even saying thank you.  This was totally unacceptable and not up to standard for a luxury brand store as the service was even worse than a supermarket.

I then went to the store in ChampsElysees and the staff there was really nice.

DON'T come to Galaries Lafayette store if you want to purchase LV goods. I regretted that I did not read the comment in google before I went. I had a wonderful experience at the LV store in the Galaries Lafayette. Mayumi H. and Axel M. were attentive and helpful. My husband and I arrived around 11am and were escorted to the second floor bc they were less customers and the. immediately sat down to await a salesperson.  Mayumi showed up shortly after and helped me find myself a bag and my husband a travel bag. Since he wanted his initials we left and came back around 4 to pick both up. We did have to wait an additional 3045 minutes bc they got busy but we were seated at a station like earlier andAxel arrived to assist us and kept us informed of the status. Fyi its extremely crowded around 4. The vibe was completely chaotic bc there were so many people in the store. Right when Axel brought out our final bags I sat there long enough to decide I wanted the other bag Mayumi showed us earlier that day as well. Axel was patient as I described it and he went hunting for it. He found it, we purchased it, and he wrapped it up with care. All in all it was a wonderful experience. Oh and I believe it was the manager who was extremely helpful in figuring out the best street to catch and Uber bc we werent going to hop back on the metro with those bags. During our visits we were served champagne and the sodas we requested.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:30 PM

I made the reservation about an hour before the tour on the day of. There was no line to get in however, I went on a day it was not busy. Not everyone will have this experience. There is a reason why they have time slots for the tour and access to the gift shop.

Once you walk through the tour, you will find yourself in the gift shop where they have the chocolates and other goods. There is also access to the cafe. I really liked the short walkthrough tour and chocolates. I will recommend this to my friends my family. Make sure you know what the expiration dates are on your chocolates. I know one of the ones I purchased had a shelf life of 10 days but it was absolutely amazing chocolate. All the other chocolate I purchased had a shelf life of like 23 months. These are great gifts! This place is located around the Louvre Museum. We came here for a lunch and some desserts.  They have a really good architecture and the cafe was amazing. The chef Maxime Frederic put his masterpiece desserts on the menu. We had Hazelnut Entremets as dessert, Veggie Salad Wrap, and Croque Sandwich filled with Ham and Cheese. They were really tasty and high quality products. To drink we had cafe latte and Iced Vanilla Latte. Also they have decaf selection for the cafe. They have accessibility for the handicapped people. There is parking opportunities around the street. The service was so fast and the staff is so kind. Especially Jeremy as our waiter was perfect. Thanks to him a lot  It is a caf and pastry shop that sells Louis Vuitton chocolates and sweets, the staff were very friendly and the sweets were delicious. The first floor area consists of a very beautiful cafeteria with big plants and a view of the Seine, but also an area where Louis Vuitton products are sold. A very nice experience, I recommend it. This is a free exhibition but I would've happily paid for it. The staff are nice and there is the option of have a guide explain highlights of the exhibit. You get to see collaboration pieces from many artists as well as understand the history of the house and it's origins. It is connected to a gift shop that sells new season products as well as actual gifts like notebooks and chocolates. The cafe has a nice view of the Seine and desserts are pricey but tasty. Free entry to the exhibition which is great if you're into fashion and history of. Came to try Maxime Frdric's menu. The Hazlenut Entremet was my personal fav. Friendly staff, nice ambience.

The staffs are friendly and helpful to all my requests, providing all sizes of the clothes, colour and their professional advice.

Really appreciate the nice client advisor Jordan Delaunay
Highly recommend him to the people who are interested in shopping in this shop

Thanks so much! In October, we visited Moncler with the intention of buying a new winter coat and unfortunately had one of my worst experiences while in Paris. Throughout our interaction with the sales representatives and the manager, there was a distinct lack of customer service. When the sales representative, Nodar T, inquired about our payment method and we mentioned cash, he hurried away. Shortly thereafter, a tall, slim individual, who identified himself as the manager Arnold, approached us. His demeanor was cold, unwelcoming, and exuded a negative aura. My partner and I felt incredibly uncomfortable.

Despite investing a significant amount of money in this jacket, we were disappointed to find that we received no complimentary drinks or any form of proper treatment during our visit. The lack of hospitality made it evident that our extended presence in the store was not anticipated.The overall experience fell short of our expectations and left us considering alternative options for our purchase.

My  jacket was not provided with a dust bag instead, tissue paper was used. This unexpected lapse in presentation further contributed to our disappointment. Later, we visited another Moncler location Galeries Lafayette Haussmann, where we were not only given a dust bag but also encountered a more empathetic and customerfocused approach. While I happy with my choice of jacket, I remain highly dissatisfied with the customer experience at the Champslyses location and would not recommend. Ines Chehidi was fantastic to work with. Super nice. No pressure. Very nice. I was only looking to buy a jacket because it was raining and I left the hotel without it. But she was super nice and I ended up getting boots and a jacket for myself and my wife. She is a great asset to the store. Redouane helped my wife and I with our shopping.  In general he is one of the friendliest and warmest person we met here in Paris.   Professionally, he is very knowledgeable and most importantly he is very patient too.  I had to exchange my purchase with him the next day, and again he was so helpful and nice.  Great store even better customer service. Thanks again Redouane 5 star review for Dara, one of our favorite sales associates at Moncler. He knew exactly our style and was extremely helpful. Great guy and an overall fantastic experience. Come visit him!","Monday: 10:30 AM – 7:45 PM

Absolutely fabulous experience in this boutique. I loved testing all the wonderful perfumes and receiving assistance in choosing the best ones for myself. Hocine was so kind, helpful and caring. In fact, he was truly inspiring. I left feeling like an upgraded version of myself. I will never forget the wonderful service and products of the Byredo store. I hope to return soon. It was a real pleasure to shop there! Amazing customer experience, big thanks to Ksenia, who made my shopping just wonderful! Also very stylish interior, great choice The salesperson at this Byredo shop was fantastic! She was friendly and shared interesting anecdotes about the brand's history and the creator. I highly recommend this flagship store for your Byredo shopping. I came to the store to purchase a back up of my favourite fragrance Bal D'Afrique. The sales assistant was super friendly and had a lot of knowledge. She introduced me to some of the other fragrances too. I found some new favourites. Thiss my third visit to the store, exilent service thanks to Xenia, shes just professional and very elegant with her way dealing with customers always ask for her .

Louis Vuitton Paris Printemps Haussmann,"64 Bd Haussmann, 75009 Paris, France",3.4,48.87390739999999,2.328352199999999,"My friend and I came to this store in the morning to buy a bag, and we were served by a French saleswoman. Her attitude was excellent. My friend bought a Carryall, and this saleswoman was very considerate, proactively adding stuffing to the bag. The shopping experience was perfect. 

This twostar review, however, is for an Asian male sales. In the afternoon, my boyfriend went to the store to buy a bag for me, and he was attended by this Asian guy. Since my boyfriend saw that he was Asian, he asked if he could speak Chinese. The salesperson replied that he could speak a little, but suggested they speak English instead.

However, in the morning, I saw this same guy speaking fluent Chinese to an older lady right next to me while introducing bags. I don't understand why he refused to speak Chinese to my boyfriend and insisted on using Englishthis is the first issue.

Fine, if English is preferred, my boyfriends English is quite good. But later, when my boyfriend inspected the bag, he noticed many creases and requested a replacement. The salesperson refused. My boyfriend insisted and pointed out that he knew there were three more of this same bag in the store, so why couldn't they replace it?

Only after my boyfriend made this clear did the salesperson finally agree to show him another bag. Moreover, he didnt add any stuffing to the bag, which was a stark contrast to the excellent service we had received in the morning. The shopping experience was worlds apart.

BTW you speak English with a VERY strong Chinese accent 

After I got the bag, I noticed it still had obvious defects. I was really speechless about the quality control.  Visited this outlet in the evening of May and had the most wonderful time. The sales lady sorry, can't remember her name but she was a middle aged lady was very hospitable and patient. I had already made up my mind what to buy beforehand, so she spent nearly an hour showing my friend various bags and wallets. After we paid and got ready to leave, she even gifted us with 4 perfume samples each,  covered our shopping bag with a plastic cover as it was drizzling outside and told us she would be available to serve us again the next evening if we decide to buy anything else. We're super impressed with her excellent service even though we didn't buy as many items as some other customers.
Pro tip do make an appointment before going so you can avoid the queue. I am happy to meet the Wonderful staff name  Bendrer Zakaria He is friendly, enthusiastic and attentive He offered us drinks.will and given advice on product selection very patient .And showed me the latest jewelry collection while waiting. Recommend a restaurant to me at the end . He is so great! Had to queue for 30 minutes at opening to get inside. A staff member was checking availability for customers in line, which was super helpful. All staff members I encountered were really friendly, and I got served a drink while making my purchase  a nice touch that should be a norm but I didnt find at other brands in Printemps.

Big thanks to Terhi for the fantastic service!

Edit I revisited the 14th April and I had the opposite experience due to the incompetence of the lady managing the line. She first told me that the item I was looking for was in stock, hence I joined the queue for 30 mins, only to realised there was nothing I wanted. She also asked me to enter the boutique first and she would assign someone to me, no one after 30 minutes Im deeply disappointed with my recent experience at LV. Despite being a loyal customer for many years, I was treated poorly by the staff. We waited over an hour, which I understand can happen, but the lack of courtesy was unacceptable. This is not what I expect from LV. I hope improvements can be made.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

From the moment I walked in, he made the visit memorable. Diego was incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the brand, taking the time to share insights about the store and its collections, which enhanced the overall experience.

He was also extremely helpful in guiding me through the Global Blue program and taxfree shopping, making the process smooth and stressfree. His professionalism and genuine enthusiasm for helping customers made a big impression. If you're considering visiting Acne Studios, I highly recommend it  and be sure to ask for Diego! This is a muststop for anyone looking for not only amazing pieces but also topnotch service.

Thank you, Diego, and Acne Studios, for a fantastic shopping experience! There is a big problem with the service attitude of the blackhaired staff who speaks Korean. She looks down upon you since you enter the door and ignores you. I definitely dont recommend everyone to come to this store. It will ruin the mood of the day In addition to the particularly poor quality of the jeans sold they should last 6 months at most, I note the total absence of aftersales service, which would be a minimum given the hidden defects in the fabrics, and also the fact that the manager of the rue Froissart shop does absolutely nothing to remedy the situation quite the contrary. In short, a brand and a shop to be avoided. Had such a wonderful experience with Suwan An back in April. Exemplary service from start to finish, even serving us champagne to celebrate my birthday. This is what instore shopping should be like. A gorgeous experience Service was great and most of staffs were friendly.

Um ma'am how can one carefully and quietly sort through items on a METAL ROD? BLESS YOUR HEART.
I didn't let her rudeness win, and still purchased an item I adored.  Just be mindful of the snarky blonde that wants you to say BONJOUR LOUD ENOUGH FOR HER TO HEAR YOU DESPITE THE CROWD INSIDE THE TINY SPACE.  I know she heard me on my phone in my American English and immediately just decided to discriminate. I was greeted by a lovely blonde lady, however towards the end when I decided to put down a top I was holding the dark haired girl asked me where is the top in such a rude way as if she was trying to accuse me of something.

Thanx God I'm a V.I.P.,"12 Rue de Lancry, 75010 Paris, France",4.3,48.8692843,2.3604019,"One of the vintage stores in Paris specially for women. Lined up by colour and you find some great design pieces for fairly good price. You could stay for hours. A MUST GO SPOT FOR TRUE VINTAGE LOVERS! Theres literally everything you could ever dream of in this gem of a vintage store. You can tell that the owners and staff truly care for this shop everything has been selected carefully and organized in color. Theres not only clothing in endless varieties but also accessories to die for! But the best part of the experience was one of the sales people, a young man with dark curly hair and beautiful eyes he was very observant and attentive whenever I had 1 or 2 things in hand that I wanted to try, he offered several times to put them aside for me, while I browsed on in their selection, calm and patient offered to show me to the cash register when I looked ready to pay and was easy and nice to chat with  overall my experience was top notch and I truly recommend it! A new, luxurious approach to vintage shopping. Shop consists of two adjacent store, for men and women. The selection is vast, with lots of high quality luxury pieces covering an entire range of styles, colors and materials. Helpful assistants and a cafe section ate built in to the experience.

Prices are steep, this isn't your thrift store, but you'll find pieces to keep forever. I visited Thank God Im a VIP vintage thrift store in Paris today and was pleasantly surprised to find that there are two separate locations for mens and womens items. I first entered the womens store and discovered a beautiful Etro silk scarf. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. When they realized I was looking for mens clothing, one of the women kindly walked me to the mens store next door.

Upon entering the mens store, I was warmly greeted and began shopping. While I pulled many items off the shelves, I ended up purchasing only one shirt. Unfortunately, a lot of the pieces I liked didnt fit my more athletic build and needed a larger, American sizing. Comme des Garons, in particular, tends to run small even when labeled as medium.

Overall, the store has a great selection and wonderful staff. I hope to find more items that fit my style and size in future visits. Thank you! I visited this store last week. I was asked to leave my bag at the counter... I asked the reason for this request the clerk told me that it was a management request... I saw that some clients on the back Caucasians were having their bags with them... I left the location, telling the clerk that I will not spend my money there.
I call this behavior a RACIAL PROFILING. I felt humiliated and shamed, where YOU should be the ones feeling bad. Your clients need to know who you truly are.
Dont try to fool us answering that you have staff from different background. That will certainly not excuse your disgusting rule and behavior.

To answer to the owners response I know what I experienced. And minimizing what was  a terrible mistake on your behalf, hiding behind pity excuses doesnt help the situation and adds to the wound. It is quite pathetic. I will definitely send you an email.","Monday: Closed

Système Solère · Le Temple du Vintage · Saint-Paul,"23 Rue des Ecouffes, 75004 Paris, France",4.6,48.8571024,2.3587012,"One of my favorite curated vintage shops in Paris if not my number one!!

They have two locations FYI

The shop has multiple curators. So you get a really good and wide range of selections. Different flavors of secondhand pieces if you will.

This shop is if you like hot girl clothing. But it also has some really great one of a kind exquisite pieces too.

The accessories are fantastic lots of good belts, shoes, bags, and jewelry. But the belts and shoe selection shine.

Very friendly and helpful staff. Definitely a must visit! I found so many unique pieces today! Definitely a happy medium between high end vintage and basement dwelling bin digging. selection was SO GOOD, something for everyone. My sister and I are very bull in a china shop vibes but the staff was SO kind and accommodating. Prices were GREAT! Definitely a range of high and low. Will be coming back when Im in Paris and telling my friends. LOVE! A small selection of used clothes for women and men, some show heavy use. Prices are fairly high. Eva was so wonderful and helpful! This shop has really cute clothes and accessories with reasonable prices. Definitely recommend!! Wonderful gem of second hand and vintage clothes, offering a fantastic chance to acquire beautiful and hardly worn pieces of clothes from high end brands at affordable prices. Lovely and helpful staff. Thank you!","Monday: 12:00 – 7:30 PM

So luxurious, beautiful and comfortable at the same time.

Lovely little avenue of shops and restaurants, a must visit whilst in Paris This is place which should be visited for sure in Christmas season. The decoration would be very nice. And it's majorly know for its shopping brands. Its a small passage located in the main center. But its famous like most of the tourists visit here for sure for shopping and there is a coffiure for ladies as well. This passage was surrounded by all the branded clothes,watch sotres.

LEMAIRE | Boutique Paris Elzévir,"1 Rue Elzevir, 75003 Paris, France",3.9,48.8578591,2.3608287,"Finally got to visit this store, and was so lucky to have Ji as our amazing stylist!! Thanks to his sensibility, patience, experience and passion for the brands products, we found more products we love than we originally expected. Such a great shopping experience. And the store is beautiful like a gallery.  Absolutely wonderful experience and would visit again for next stay in Paris! The store is well designed and the service is professional and considerate. You could explore different possibility of dressing here with great assistance! Recommend. I went in for a Croissant bag but, thanks to Jis patience and attention, left with a coat and shirt I love. Great experience! If you want to experience the famous Parisian arrogance, you can experience it here.

When I asked for an availability of croissant bag, the brunette pony tail French lady looked irritated and saw me with a scary face as if I was harassing her. She said we might have it, but I dont know. My friend and I were scared.

Maybe the working condition is terrible, and the store is busy, but they dont have to make us feel terrible.

The shopping is also about the experience and from whom you buy it, and its not about being treated as an enemy. No matter the trend, I will never forget this emotion about the croissant bag. For a French luxury brand, the experience was not luxury at all. Came with my group of 4 friends we were all asians and no one came to help us or check on us even though there were available sales assistants! It was only when I approached a sales assistant to help did he ask someone to help us, which took a while. I also felt like I had to beg to try on shoes in my size as it seemed like the lady serving me was not keen at all. Worse still, when I was trying items using a mirror, another sales assistant with his client hogged the mirror and did not even regard my existence there. FYI there are other mirrors around and there was no one at my area, plus I only spent a short time there. If I wasnt intending to already purchase something, I probably would not have done so due to the subpar service. At the counter, after I purchased my item, I received hostile  judging looks from the other staff.
The items are nice, but the unfortunately the service just diminishes the entire experience.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:30 PM

Thank you so much and we will be back when we come back to Paris! I was served by super nice sales named Johnny who proposed me a name customization on the lip stick. It was perfect since it was a gift for my collegue. He also gave me some parfume samples and a mini lipstick. Thank you Johnny !! It was a very wonderful experience of all luxury stores that I've been to. Anni, she was the best! Her explanation about the products and the brand was perfect. Every single details that this woman gave me was just great. I will definately go there again. I was shopping here with no specific idea of what I wanted in mind. The stuff was incredibly friendly and offered me different perfumes to choose from adjusting to my preferences.

Now this is my go to store for perfumes when in Paris. Thanks a lot and see you again! Happened upon this store today while wandering around . We had Sophie helping us and let me just tell you  what a breath of fresh air she is! She was so pleasant to shop with and helpful beyond belief! It was my first time coming in to the store and I have my friend visiting from the US and she made such a wonderful experience for us !! We actually walked out of the store and said wow! That was fun! She showed us different options and and available items . She even suggested my friend laser her bottles to memorialize her trip and my friend took a bottle as gifts for friends back home !! It was just such a nice way to show my friends back home that Paris has some great sales employees , as well! If you happen to come across her, you will be in for a treat!

First of all, it's spacious and not just street vendors, but mostly stores? It's the same thing. It's a flea market that locals visit more than tourists. It's about 5 times bigger than Vanves. It's a shame that I arrived at the SaintOuen flea market so quickly that there wasn't anything to see. And since I didn't see anything to buy, I just walked around the neighborhood and looked around. It's not the flea market you think it is, and the security isn't very good either. I got pickpocketed here. It is not a flea market like Korean tourists expected. There's nothing to see.

But King of Frip is much more organized with a higher likelihood of higher quality items. I could only find one changing room, and you have to step outside for the mirror. I found a few bold jackets that were a size too large for me. Interesting selection of vintage clothing. Its crammed full of merchandise. It would take a while to find something you wanted, but they probably would have it. It's nice but a bit pricey for a second hand store. They have a good selection of clothes though!

The gallery spaces are vast and well curated. My only advise would be to go as early as possible and book Amazing architecture modern building  The public transport will include taking a bus. There is a 15 min walk from the metro station.

Next to foundation, there is amusement park around and the kids zoo could be other things to enjoy in the area. Definitely worth visiting! Architecturally the building is gorgeous so many interesting lines, shapes and forms. Once inside the collection is impressive we were able to see Ellsworth Kellys work, Basquiat, and more. Also, they have a fantastic caf called Frank. I recently visited the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris to see the Matisse exhibit and was blown away by the stunning collection on display. The building itself is a work of art, with its unique architecture and beautiful design.

The exhibit was incredibly wellcurated, showcasing a wide range of Matisse's works and providing insight into his creative process.

I would highly recommend visiting the Louis Vuitton Foundation for anyone interested in art and culture. It's a mustsee destination in Paris, and I can't wait to go back and explore more of their exhibits in the future. A museum of modern contemporary art with a rotating collections. If you looking to see any LV related stuff avoid, there is none. But if you looking to check art from famous artists check the schedule on the museum website, but in any case I recommend it is worth a visit for overall vibes and atmosphere allow two hours for your visit to see all spaces of the museum","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

I've ordered a massage chair in August 2021 and paid it in full, including delivery to the door to Serbia from France. It should have been delivered in 10 days. Six months later  still not delivered. I have contacted the Paris HQ, they promised to facilitate, but still nothing. And now they've stopped answering phone calls and emails at all.

UPDATE upon Bodyfriend's reply Bodyfriends reply is a very good illustration of what was happening since I paid for my order on 06.08.2021 till it was finally delivered on 25.03.2022 I have put my comment in February 2022, and their reply comes 2 months later saying that they cannot do anything. I was chasing Bodyfriend to get update on the status of my delivery fully paid to the door, and had no answers for weeks, finally I had to chase local subcontractor engaged by Bodyfriend and pay him for his services to actually get the chair delivered to me. I didnt accept the compensation  they have just paid it without answering my questions, and it mainly covers excessive customs fees that I had to pay due to lack of proper data and communication between Bodyfriend and their engaged local shipper, as well as the cost of his services, which Bodyfriend undertook to be at their expense. I do not want anything extra and do not expect anything from Bodyfirend  this is the worst clients relationships management Ive ever seen in my life. The best place too relax  I went during fashion week and the lady there was very attentive  she explained everything perfectly. I am going to go back to buy a chair when this is over  as I really need this at home now  no more spa massages for me sadly! Perfect place to relax! We received our chair this afternoon. Very fast delivery and perfect product!!
Just like in a store, really highend.
The feeling of being massaged by real hands. As a health professional and a manual therapist, I recommend it  in addition to good care.
I would like to thank ALBORZ again who received us for the demonstration. My wife and I discovered massage chairs in Asia during a trip. Very quickly won over, we visited the Bodyfriend boutique in Paris where we were welcomed very warmly. We purchased the Palace II which was delivered and installed this morning.

This place is a dream. I love plants and nature in general and this place makes me feel really happy. There are different kiosks, different owners and each one of them sells different items for your garden or your house.

Unfortunately i couldn't buy anything because i was traveling without much space. But of course, next time i will have to bring a truck. Especially for all those door knobs and the wind chimes.

You won't regret coming here and seeing all the beautiful plants and items here. Well visiting Paris, my wife and I had the fortune to stumble across this beautifully laid out garden center. Here you can find a wealth of beautiful flowers and gardening and florist related items.

At 1000 in the morn, even on a Friday, the market was relaxed, welcoming and laidback.
One of the standout features of this market was the sheer variety of items available. Whether you were in the mood for a crisp apple, a bag of locally roasted coffee beans, a cold craft beer, ora piece of handmade pottery, you were guaranteed to find it here. I particularly enjoyed perusing the selection of cheeses and freshly baked breads, which made for a perfect picnic lunch.
In addition to the impressive selection of goods, the market also offered a vibrant and diverse food scene.  Overall, highly recommend checking out this market. With its vibrant energy, welcoming atmosphere, and diverse selection of goods and food, it is truly a gem in the heart of the city. We stayed at Paris de Gare Lyon for its accessibility to other places. Within walking distance, this is a brilliant place where we bought fruits, bread most baguette and snacks to hotel. It's so lovely to see how local people buy things, converse with the stall people and go about their lives. The berries are at really nice price. Love it. Definitely a must go for true local French food and experience.  It is a nice little market with all sort of food with a super Sunday market too.  Ambience is great and busy.   Great place for foodies. A lot of cafe around the area or can just take away some fresh food and eat in nearby park too. Great indoor market! Not overwhelming like some bigger markets.
There is also an outdoor market Saturday mornings that includes antiques and books.","Monday: Closed

Various  food which looks fresh.
I bought fresh burata cheese, Juice, pain and pork.
Big fun of food trip if you can use Kitchen at the your stay.

And you can have good coffee at 600, in the middle of long market place. Under metro 6 line. From Motte to dupleix. We always visit this market when we travel to Paris. The array of quality produce is huge and the street food stalls mean you can have a bite to eat as you browse. This place has a little bit of everything it is a spot we definitely recommend to go when it is open and if your in Paris France we highly recommend this place and we definitely will be returning here when we are back in Paris France  This is a wonderful place with lots of shops with very good, fresh vegetables. It also has specialized honey shop, shop for wooden craft, daily use items etc. One fo the major negative side of this Marche is their comparatively high priced fromageries i.e. cheese shops. There are 3 of them in this big marche and i believe that all are very expensive compared to some other Marche's in Paris.","Monday: Closed

Italian Cheese, fresh meat, fruits, seasonal vegetables, clothing, antiques. Great place to buy your locallygrown produce and cooked food if you don't want to cook but would still like to grab a very healthy and goodtasting meal for your family, like the roasted meats with a fresh salad. They sell meats and seafood here as well. Saturday morning is a good time to come here. The fact the chefs from the Ritz buy their ingredients from this market should tell you about the quality here.

My wife picked up a flower and said that they were easily the biggest peonies she'd ever seen. This is a wonderful market on PortRoyal Blvd where the locals do their shopping three times per week. There are loads of produce, fresh fruit stands. There is meat and a variety of fish stalls as well as cheese, milk, and eggs. This is where you should do your shopping if you live in the area. There is no bread stand, but the reason is that there is a Boulangerie right in on the corner of St. Jacques and PortRoyal. Make sure to walk around to check prices and quality as they vary from stand to stand. Vendors are nice and helpful. Nice on Wednesdays and Saturdays, not the best but super nice walk in a good atmosphere. Well, I like buying fruits and vegetables from here, because they are fresh, good quality, cheaper than a supermarket, and most importantly, the farmers earn money directly. Find a farmer's market near you, and buy stuff from there. Saterday market is fine. Tuesday and Thursdays not many commerant","Monday: Closed

We went to the Italian place and had some of the best pasta and burrata. The arancini was very good also. Definitely recommend going and eating as it is a great busy atmosphere and food from all over the world. Nice, mostly covered market  it was indeed a rainy day. Some vendors not operating at least on a weekday late morning, but some nice options to buy produce, cheese etc and to eat in, from classic French fare to Italian options. Not super busy when I went, and not all places looked equally inviting. This is not a market for groceries but instead a food court of international cuisine, sort of. You can find food stalls in Italian, pasta and pizza, cous cous, Japanese, oyster bar,....and of course French. Early time in the morning still sees stalls in preparation, the best to visit is lunch hours when all operation is full blown. Was disappointed to see the actual market. Thought itd be something more bustling but it was more of food stalls. We had the worst chicken from the stall Chez Wagner. It was advertised as grilled chicken leg and was expecting a juicy cut. However we were served the breast portion and it tasted like overcooked overnight meat. Only saving grace were the vegetables. Not really a messy farmers market kind of vibe but more of an organised food stall area. Many small stores with standing bars but some store have sitting areas. Only gets crowded during the afternoons. In the morning, there was not much stuff. Beside the Miam miam sandwich place so worth the visit!","Monday: Closed

We went in late July so it was quieter than normal according to the traders. The bakery stall halfway through, with chairs to sit and have a coffee, was great. The galettecrepe stand at the end of the market was great too. Top quality produce and not too expensive for organic bio produce. Good selection of organic fresh fruit and veggies. Also good quality fresh fish. Amazing farmers market with fresh fruits, cheese and meats.  You can find even find handmade items, scarves, and wine. Def worth a stop.

Your senses will be engaged from start to finish. Find the murals throughout. Beautiful flea market. A hidden gem  for those who like treasures and vintage objects.  Not a cup of tea for everyone,  but for me, it is a maze full of treasures, an adventure where you can find what you are less expecting.  Nice to go to a different place, to see real French people doing business with their history. Undoubtedly the largest flea market in Paris, offering thousands of diverse items, from antique keys and door handles to exclusive furniture and interior decor. Theres also a plethora of Chinese counterfeit apparel, watches, and shoes. Its possible to spend an entire day exploring and discovering unique finds.

I suggest visiting if you want to bring a touch of Parisian uniqueness to your home. So many things to look at. Read up about the various markets. Some are closer to trash and you may be looking for that and others are closer to museum quality with the associated cost. One could should? actually split this review in the hundreds, of little shops that sell antiques there, which are absolutely amazing and sell at very advantageous prices.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 5:00 PM

On this particular Sunday, not all the shops were open which was strange considering the great location.

Given its proximity to the main stations, its surprising it doesnt attract more tourists. Most clients seem to be locals. The vicinity is a diverse area with ethnic shops from
African and Middle Eastern heritage, money changers, and general goods stores.

Inside the market, many stalls had built in seating for dining on the spot. The main dining area provides additional seating for clients buying from any food stall. The selection was limited as it seemed like there was one of any one kind of cuisineproducts.

Great place to get away from the train station and have some quality food and some tranquillity. Neighborhood spot I was only tourist here for lunch on Sunday.  Went to a seafood stand and got a bottle from the wine shop.  Narrow hours for many places here, but some great eats to be had.  Great variety Very nice traditional French covered market with a good selection of fresh food stalls and attractive florist stand. Everything appears fresh and delicious. Well worth popping in if you are in the area. We live in a hotel right by this market, and we had our breakfast here. It was just so nice. We passed by some different culture restaurants like the Moroccan restaurant. We also bought some cheese and some fruits. When you walk in here its like the men have never seen a women before  perhaps its best to leave tourists alone and allow them to enjoy themselves and allow them to purchase items without lots of questions. Most people prefer to be left alone however I did like this market it was really cute. We came here for the sushi bar only. Best sushi in Paris made in front of us also.","Monday: Closed

Be sure to bargain a bit  marked prices are high. It is smaller than in the past, but if you're a stamp collector and in Paris, this is still the place to go!

On second floor, there are lots of old records store, toys, clothing, posters and small things. In the middle atrium there is a display like an UFO, which is closed. Its a future house.

There is a shop providing shipping service for antiques. See details in last photo. Its a nice place to spend some time looking at old and notsoold things if youre into this kind of stuff.

Im not a big fan of antiquities, but as a tourist I found it interesting anyway, as it somehow tells you what French people love and used to love.

You can find records, CDs and photographs of famous singers, actors, brands, social and political figures, among many others.

If youre not in the area, I dont recommend you to go there specifically to visit this place. However, if youre nearby, pay it a visit. It great to have a different perspective not everything in Paris are big and expensive brands.

However, take into account that a single small photograph can cost you about 30 euros there. No, its not cheap at all. If you like old things you will love this place. Vendors open when it suits them so I have no idea when the place is bustling and brimming with people and activity. Great antiques worth a pretty penny. The vintage clothing scene is small, expensive and real. We found some beautiful things that we could not afford. The street outside also has magnificent shops with amazing things to see even if you cant afford. Real nice with diverse finds from anticques, vintage, fake and completely overpriced.

Lacks automatic cash machines, so you have to sit in line for a while.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 9:30 PM

About half of the shops are open and some are arranging to open. Theres a wide range of objects you can find. Furnitures and carpets are really nice, as well as household wares, lamps, vases. There are also clothing and jewellery, old keychains and badges, etc. Some shops are like art galleries. The quality of the objects are well curated and nicely displayed. its a very nice stroll even if you dont plan to buy anything. This has been my favourite market. Big variety of goods in vintage and antique category. Pricing ranges from fair to overpriced. But it's up to the customer to pay or negotiate a price.

I found this market has the best variety of goods compared to the others in this area. Lots of treasures here. You may have to search in the maze of stores. The most authentic flea market in Paris St ouen. You can find all the eras there, far from the ""galleries"" of other markets... unmissable A flea market with many small streets and small shops. There are a large collections of old beautiful items, coffee grinders, lampshades, light switches, furniture, jewelry..","Monday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM

The tea towels are fantastic looking and great quality. My son picked out a nice keychain and we also got one of those iconic France flag produce bags.

Don't waste time looking for souvenirs. Just come here. Get it done in 5 min.

Follow me for more reviews, tips and photos! Fabulous shop close to the metro.  Everything is made in France and things are not overpriced.  Wonderful assortment of gifts that makes it a 1 stop shop for all the gifts you want to bring home to friends and family! Quite a small store, but some interesting unique things to buy as souvenirs This is such a wonderful little souvenir shop. The owner was so friendly and helpful. There was a good selection of unique gifts at reasonable prices. I was so happy to support a local business. The shop's French Poodle is also a very big plus! He was so sweet and friendly! Far and away the best souvenir shop in Paris. The store only sells authentic made in France items that are high quality and that you wont find in the million other bargain souvenir shops in the city. The storekeeper was so friendly and offered to gift wrap my items. Truly a unique shopping experience. Cant wait to return to see whats new.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Le Petit Prince,"8 Rue Grégoire de Tours, 75006 Paris, France",4.7,48.853409,2.337744,"I love the story of The Little Prince, so of course I had to pay this store a visit. It's a small store, but if you're a fan you'll find everything your heart desires. There were so many different editions of the book, too! I especially loved the Scottisch version. The prices are fair and the staff is very friendly. The woman who was working when we went was new, but did her best to help us in the best way she could. Like the prince himself, I'd like to think I travelled across the planets and galaxies to reach this beautiful shop, considering I came from Australia. But the staff here are very kind, helpful, spoke English and the store itself, I mean, thanks to Antoine, I could literally buy one of each in the store and still not have enough.

This is a huge must even if you are a remote fan of the book! Staff here was so lovely!! Definitely worth a visit! Great selection of gifts and all so adorable. One of the prettiest shops we went to in Paris. Great for fans of the novel. We literally wanted to buy everything! Too bad the English copy of the book was out of stock we wanted to give our daughter her first copy, so the saleslady pointed us to Shakespeare  Co. near Notre Dame. But still, such a pretty store! The Little Prince Store in Paris is a beautiful and effervescent manifestation of a childhood classic. The store is located in the heart of the city, on the Rue de la Paix, and it is a mustvisit for any fan of the book.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Boutique Maille,"6 Pl. de la Madeleine, 75008 Paris, France",4.3,48.8689215,2.3244866,"Nice store. Variety of flavors to try, some unique to this store. One of the vendors was really great. He was incredibly useful and knowledgeable about all the products. I had a great experience trying different flavors and will be back. I visited Boutique Maille because my manager loved their selection of mustards.  The person that helped me was very accommodating in answering my question since it was the first time that Ive been there.   The store itself was very easy to shop in.  All the products were neatly shelved with all their labels facing straight.  What was really great was you can choose different coloured reusable jars they would pour your choice of mustard from taps affixed on their counter, then they would seal the jar with a cork.

Truly a great experience! Lovely little shop where you can buy all sorts of different types of original mustards and mayonnaises. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. They seem to care about the products that they sell. Fantastic service, the employees are incredible polite and knowledgeable when it comes to mustard, you get to taste all of there products and see if you like them before buying any.
The prices are a steep, but you cant find that mustard anywhere else.

Visited   16. August 2024 I visit the Maille Boutique everytime i visit paris. I've been shopping here for years and you MUST visit if you like mustard. They have a great variety of different flavored mustards. Every product is high quality. You can also get fresh mustard from the pump. The staff is very
kind everytime i visit.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

Les Drapeaux de France - Noxa depuis 1949,"Place Colette, 75001 Paris, France",4.8,48.863227,2.3365772,"Wonderful shop full to the brim of metal figurines, lovingly shared and carefully curated into every subject imaginable! Unique shop! A real rabbit hole of wonder! Excellent service .. its a must visit in Paris! One of the most unique stores in Paris! An awesome selection of figurines from all eras, including random small statues, animals, and other antiques. This place is everything I thought it would be.old, dusty, stacked floor to ceiling, friendly service, and a wide range of prices! If you are looking for a unique gift for a collector or history buff, this is the place you need to go. Just dont get stuck in there for hours like I did lol I feel really lucky to have stumbled upon this figurine shop! Tiny, delicate, and fascinating miniature collectables of all shapes and types. From trees, to soldiers, to animals, to machinery including ships and Christmas items.

Just to drop in for a browse is great fun.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.

If youre taking young kids along ensure you control them because they can break things very easily.

And store hasnt got a lot of room but it packs plenty of wonderful stock. This is without doubt one of the most extraordinary shops I have seen in my life. If you like miniatures you must stop by. Hand Painted figurines of every sort, from wwii soldiers, to revolutionary France, to erotica and medieval cavalry. The only drawback are the prices, very very high, e.g. 200 euros for twoinch soldier. This is perhaps adequate given the quality, and the craftsmanship that goes into each one of them is extraordinary. Still, prices are high enough that I was discouraged from buying.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 7:30 PM

If you want to go shopping for nonmainstream souvenir gifts then this store is for you. They sold unique prints, cups, tin cans, magnets and other tourist paraphernalia. I bought a souvenir tinb box from this store with a print of the  Metro map on it. The man behind the counter was helpful and cheeful. It was a small souvenir shop I entered by chance, but it was quieter and more neatly decorated than typical souvenir shops, and the owner, the old man, was very nice and friendly. Moreover, above all, it is about 25 cheaper than the souvenir shop right in front of the Wall of Love. I highly recommend it. Beautiful store to buy different souvenirs. Very good owner attention.

When I finished checking out and was ready to leave, the staff stopped me from leaving and went through my backpack. He found my iphone charger cable from the apple store and took it out and asked me. This is not an item sold in your store. So I would like to ask you to give me an explanation of the clerk's behavior. Finally, I am an Asian.Here is proof of my purchase of the plug in the Apple Store, although I don't have to provide it because you can check your security footage.

The security guard helped me with self check codes. Super friendly. The employees just want you out ten minutes before closing.  The customers needs may or may not be met.

Market Paris Maubeuge,"33 Rue de Maubeuge, 75009 Paris, France",3.8,48.8784256,2.344824,"It says it closes at 22h, but the doors close at 21h45, with a very bad behavior from the security responsible Rotten vegetables empty shelves dirty broken fridge This evening we visited Carrefour Market at Paris 33 Rue de Maubeuge at 8.35pm, we barely got through the door before we heard yelling for us to get to the till as they were closing, even though the branch is open until 9pm leaving 25mins to do a very quick shop.

When we managed to get a small part what we needed to the till the bill came to 11.25, I handed over 21.50 to get a 10 note plus the change back and after waiting a while the cashier faffed around a while then I was only handed over 0.25 change, my wife picked this up straight away as soon as the change was put into my hand. When I said I gave you 21.50 the cashier refused to acknowledge this, she called her colleague over and then started counting together the quantity of each note type, even the coins which actually made no sense as the coin change was correct, she only needed to count the notes as I was missing the 10 note, at this point the cashier still hadn't closed the till after the transaction.

Their attitude was negative from the start, when I insisted that it was a 20 they implied it was impossible so I asked to see the manager who was absent so I asked for the name and the contact details but everyone refused, kicking up a fuss asking why do I need that. I also suggested they check the CCTV which they refused. The bouncer  security was as useless as the others saying to me come back tomorrow but till wouldnt give me the name of the manager no matter how much I insisted so I wonder what there is to hide. There is a Carrefour Market place 5 mins up the road at 63 Rue de Rochechouart that is much cleaner, has friendly helpful staff and a much better range of everything so I strongly advise you shop there. If you must shop at Maubeuge double check every cash or card transaction and avoid being served by the cashier with short hair and large glasses, also the cashier with brunette hair which came over to count the money is also just as bad. Probably all make a bit of extra personal' cash from all of this. Just a supermarket that I visit while staying overnight in a nearby hotel. The supermarket had all the basic stuff you expect and a little bit more. Nice fresh cakes, which I choose and great selection of wine. Who does not need some wine with a cake. Friendly staff and easy checkout using a plastic payment card. Paperback to put your groceries in. Carrefour for neighbourhood family shopping. Caters to family needs, groceries. Very reasonable price.

Not really clean, a bit gloomy clearer signages are required. I have visited Carrefour overseas and they look a whole lot better. Weird indeed.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 10:00 PM

Some security guards thought that they can act like a police force whereas they dont have any rights to search you.
One of them asked me several times questions about my ethnic background.
I was appalled and was wondering how can security guards can discriminante this way in France. It was a bad experience. It's a Carrefour Market. Clean and there are many items inside . There are 6 or 7 cashiers or more so dont worry to have to stay in long line for long time . We are staying at the hotel right next to it so it is a little live savior for us.. it is a clean market with fresh fruits and vegetables, drinks snacks and much more.. everything you need for the daily use you can and will find there  Nice place with a wide range of products and reasonable prices, cassiers were super friendly Beware come on time! We arrived at 21u40. At 21u50 one of the staff members was screaming at us that we had to leave because they were closed. I told him I still had 10 minutes to grab my bag of chips. He then even screamed louder and got very aggressive. Prevented me from getting anything anymore and escorted me and other people to the register. Change your openings hours to 21u50 if you dont want to work until 22. Rude staff. Ridiculous.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 10:00 PM

It is a convenient shop to get what you need in your daily life, especially if you stay in a hotel nearby, your hotel does not offer dinner and you don't feel like going out. You will find lots of various items that you would find in major supermarkets, too.
Staff has not convinced me in terms of knowing the products they are selling especially when I asked if they had instant soup. But maybe it was just this one employee.
The store is clean and well arranged and the prices are absolutely pleasant. Close to our Airbnb which was perfect! Had everything we needed, meats, cheeses, fruits and veggies. Nice selection of breads and pastries as well. We even came back later for napkins, TP and toothpaste.  Staff was curtious even though our french was novice level.","Monday: 8:30 AM – 10:00 PM

However, I'd stay clear of the sushi. I became so sick with food poisoning that I had to go to the emergency room and was hospitalized. The doctors struggled to treat it as well. This is a risk of eating raw meats so I'm unhappy it happened but also still go to this Carrefour. The rest of the store is great and can be easily accessed from multiple doors into the mall during daytime business hours. Very nice and big market. Wide assortment. Sunday morning shop is a real thrill. Get in, get out, don't get yelled at. Had the honor of being the final customer at the selfcheckout  however I realized once I got home that the last product I picked up was the wrong thing and I only grabbed it in a panic as I was being rushed out.

They carry several hardertofind vegan products like multiple brands and varieties of cheese but it's kind of hidden and not in the place I would've expected.

Not bad overall, will come back when I've got more time to find all the best organic and vegan products. Great assortment of products. They have different check outs.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 9:30 PM

Apparently, you're supposed to weigh the fruit before you buy it.  The young woman at the cashier with brown hair and glasses told me to weigh it in french. I don't speak French fluently, and she was rolling her eyes and making annoyed faces at me. Good place to buy some biscuit. Not a bad selection and is kept better stocked than Carrefour along the boulevard. Checkout space is small though they usually are well staffed so the wait isn't long.

As we approached the cashier, close to but before the closing time of 10pm, she was openly rude and derogatory  she clearly wanted to clear all tills before closing time.
Id like to respectfully remind her, and other passiveaggressive cashier staff, that the store is OPEN until 10pm. You may be tired and want to go home, but that is no reason to be overtly rude to customers.
We had paid for our goods and left the store before closing time  the whole very unpleasant experience was completely unnecessary.
The only shining example of good customer service was a very helpful and kind security guard who  helped us find what we were looking for.
Please promote him to supervisor so he can show the other staff how good customer service works. Never felt so disgusted in my life. I visited on June 4th at 19pm. I shop here everyday but today after taking my groceries from the guard at the entrance I was accused of stealing a 50 cents baguette and my groceries was taken away. Because I bought few things I left the ticket behind at the automatic cashier and the guard was not believing me, making up stories that he saw me stole the baguette. I feel humiliated I will never step into a Carrefour anymore! If you are buying your groceries close to Marcadet poissonniers just go to the Franxprix on the other side of the road. It has everything that it's needed.
The entrance and the exit part could be better.
In terms of qualityprice is okay. Fantastic endless antique and vintage and sundries market. Blocks and blocks of cool stuff Wonderfull place to walk and make picnic aside of th river.

EDIT hahaha nice joke for the response. Next time I will come in the morning. And for the records the door was actually closed. They close 5 mins before before the time showcased on the door, even if you want to buy just a bottle of water and no one is inside. Ridiculous and outrageous service!

I went twice and they asked me to check my bags both times. Last time, they checked everything item by item like I am a thief taking away every shred of your selfrespect. I am here because I can afford to buy, no need to be racist and profile people and embarrass them. Better go to another super market or any other Carrefour. I'm a big fan of Carrefour but this wasn't quite as excellent as usual. It was good but there seemed to be less of a choice and the French wines were rather disappointing. The security guard loitering around the fruit and vegetable section looking at everyone suspiciously didn't help. For daily baguette and coissant, we used the excellent local boulangeries instead. The prices are good and competitive, but the security guards and some other staff consider people as chief in priori! From my experience, for the first time that I moved to this neighborhood , I just went to check what can I find near my home and what products are disponible, so I entered the shop and to exit I was hesitated about the exit door because both doors have exit sign, so I tried to exit from the entrance,... but the security was very brutal! Every time that I am coming back from home and I will go shopping there, the security or the other staff ask me to inspect my bag. Sometimes it is unsupportable. You cannot consider everyone as a thief! It is very simple we can do shopping some where else, a little more expensive but with more respect! In addition, according to law it is just the security staff who can demand to check the bags not the other staff! The more interesting thing is that the quick shopping part is always close and I guess this is because they afraid someone may thief something, and some times you have to stay in a long queue for shopping. You guys can do better with a little respect to others! Very clean. Groceries and produce well stocked. Visited in July when travelling Paris A large supermarket, closed on Sundays.

About 1520 stalls including 2 cheese, 1 seafood, 2 butchers, a couple of food stands, flowers, veggies and clothing. Butchers and veggie stands are pretty friendly. The market is open every Sat morning and Wed afternoon, closed for the whole month of August.

Very nice products and price at the veggie and fruit stands.

However, the seafood is not that great. There were bees and insects surrounding the fish products but it was the only one with seafood so not much choice for me.

On top of that, the owner treated each customer differently. The lady before me wanted a piece of salmon and he cut a nice piece from the belly. When its my turn, he just took a leftover piece from the tail, even added another tail after weighing and finding out the first one was too small.

I asked to have a single piece of fish since I am eating alone but he replied he could only offer me tails, while there were still a lot of them with belly at 1200. Finally I just took one.

Almost 7 euros for a small piece of tail of 170g, I will go to the supermarket next time Great to stop by on Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings. Markets with many products in the center flowers, cheeses, sausages... Great French products at a very good price. Market overall good but deli stand to avoid! I have never eaten such a bad and watery stuffing and the rest of the products are generally more than average. Wednesday afternoon and Saturday morning.
Flowers and plants at Amel and Benot kindness, professionalism and quality. The cheese at Marie's always offers great discoveries. Fruits and vegetables next to flowers such beautiful products... And don't forget a small bottle of cider or sparkling apple juice... A treat!","Monday: Closed

Definitely like this store instead of Monoprix on the same street. They just seem to have a better selection of food items, and the staff that works up front at the cash registers are so much nicer here! Tip for those who love seafood , please try some if you walk there  there is a side street shop that opens on Fri and weekends in front of that convenience store. All are fresh and tasteful. We tried oysters, shrimps, snails and crab. Oyster  has light, fresh and sweet taste. I prefer the creamy ones from Wales but his ones are wonderful as well.
Shrimps are the best  full fresh, soft and so sweet. I did buy twice in the same day for it.
He prepare all the oysters and all u need is a folkspoon   to enjoy. A worker completely have no mannerism
and logical way of thinking.

I went there around 1 PM today,8 November 2023 to pick up my panier from Too good to go app.
I came up to this 40 y.o guy and said bonjour but the first thing he said was what u want? in a very rude way.
And long story short,He did not believe that i have validated my order even though i showed him the app,the history of order and everything.
Treated me like i was trying to scam.

He even took my phone away from my hand,went inside the back room without asking or saying nothing.
Which showing 0 manner.

And he finally came outside the back room after couple minutes,gave me my phone back
AND STILL NOT BELIEVE AND JUST LEFT AWAY WITH A SAYING no.

So i got nothing from the store though i paid, wasted my time and energy to go there
just to treated this bad.

I dont know if he was working while under influence of drugs,but this is the first time ive ever seen someone working with that attitude.

Regardless what my race is or how much my order cost,that just not how a service works. Conveniently located, have all you need on a daily basis and reasonably priced The shop is perfectly situated near the metro.

I was there when you said your phone had been stolen. You didn't get the situation and accused wrongly the arabic cashier. A french girl tried to explain the all thing to you in english but you refused to hear her.
Here is what happened 
You forgot your phone in a basket. A cashier found it and stored it behind in case of somebody to claim for it. When you came back to have your phone, you accused the arabic cashier, but he wasn't aware of this.
Then the other person came and gave it to you, but you accused them of stealing.
You kept being stubborn, not listening to the explainations we were giving to you.

I have just left the store on Rue de Tivoli in the Marais and was queuing behind a very elderly ladythis cashier was so rude and aggressive and disgusting in her behaviour towards the lady infront of me that Im taking the time out of my busy day to report the cashier. I cant find customer relations on the website however I hope its seen by management and this cashier is promptly sacked. A very bad reflection on Carrefour! Tired of being hungry in my hotel room at night and even more so of overpriced mediocre food stuffed into a corner since I am a solo traveler, I found this little grocery store. I was very pleased with the place. The guy was friendly and helpful and for 22 euros, I got chocolate, chips, 2 energy drinks, 2 nice cheeses, dried salami, pasta salad, olives and a bagette! Highly recommend as a tourist  2 small bottles of water in a plastic bottle costs 3 euros. Very neat and organised but most of the items were out of stock. It would be better if all items needed were in stock rather than empty shelfs.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Bought 3 big bottles of water for less than 2, so not as expensive as the surrounding neighbourhood. The security asked to my boyfriend open the jacket in the middle of everyone suggesting that he was hidden something under the coat, was completely evasive and non sense at all. And even when he saw that he was hiding nothing, he just leave and don't even apologize. I don't know where these people are trained but everyone knows that is a problem worldwide, a guy was murder in Brazil last month by the hands of the security team of Carrefour... Disgusting company!

They also have 2 essential ingredients for good homemade Chinese food that I could not find elsewhere chili garlic sauce and black bean sauce. A cramped little store with an excellent selection of ingredients for all kinds of east Asian cuisines, from lemongrass and galangal to nori and kimchi, and of course many kinds of rice, vegetables, and frozen seafood.  The prices are somewhat better than what you'd find in the more traditional supermarkets, too.  I only wish they'd be open a little later so it would be easier to shop there on my way home from work. A little bit pricey but it's a nice location so that you don't have to go to Chinatown 13th10th for Asian groceries. Mainly Chinese. Some Korean and Japanese goods as well.

2. Missing prices

Picked laundry detergent off shelf as priced for 2.65 and they charged me 4.95. Tried to tell me the 200ml tube was for 2.65. The price tag was specific for the 400ml box. Then I gave him a 20 note and he gave me change for 10. I got the correct change eventually but could be bothered arguing for the correct price. Total scam  Thief. Hope others read this before going in. This is what pisses you off about traveling and people making excuses for the language barrier. So pissed off. 2.5 euros each 1.5L bottle of water !!!!!!!!
We bought two bottles of 1.5L water, there was no price tag on the shelf so we asked for the price. We picked two different brands and the clerk said the price is the same.
Normally, they are lower than 1 euro in supermarkets. If the other markets are still open, go to other one. Do you have to sell a kidney to be able to buy from you? 350 evian !!!!

No, I don't have the wrong store my ticket and write cocci market and when I look at the location on my Apple Pay it's the wrong statements it's a crime! And I'm not the only one according to the comment found your prices not displayed and random price !

Fleeing your responsibilities will not bring you anything

Toi tre voleur ! I had a UPS package delivered to the store. The experience was dissapointing. The shop was closed for half a day during the working hours, totally out of the blue moon. The owner was rude, since presumably I couldn't speak French he could not communicate in English. Avoid this store if you can. Incroyable!,

Avoid! Don't order your UPS here, it gets stolen or sent away.","Monday: 5:00 AM – 2:00 AM

There is no receipt provided. I bought 2 times in one day. 2 times, and no receipt.
The 2nd time I bought a shopping bag which cost only 4.99, I paid 10 and the staff didn't give me the change!
I admitted I overlooked it. But when I came back to the store after 10 seconds. The staff is still holding my 10 talking with his colleagues and not even thinking of putting it in the cashier!
When I came back and asked for my return, he asked if I had 5 change. I thought he was out of coins, so I searched for coins to pay for that. But I eventually found out he had the change but just didn't want to give it to me. It wasted my extra time to handle this incident he wasn't willing to talk with me about why he missed the change after all. No apologies at all. It was an unpleasant experience. Nice service.
