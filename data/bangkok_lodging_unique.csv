Lilit Bang Lumphu Hotel - Bangkok,"Phrasumeru Road, 55, 8 ตรอก บ้านหล่อ Baanphanthom, Phranakorn, กรุงเทพมหานคร 10200, Thailand",4.5,13.7616075,100.501267,"Initially found it quite soulless and disappointing. It grew on me a bit though. I was so pleased they changed the awful pop music rotation to some light cafe jazz. It made a world of difference, improved my stay, and I was able to work in the area above reception. Wifi works well.

The beds and thick curtains are quite nice. Walls are pretty thin between rooms though so you can hear snorers right next to you that you cant kick. Beds are close together but I thankfully had good roommates so that didnt matter. Lockers are spacious and secure. Bathrooms are good and towels are free. They also give you a free bottle of water every day. The cleaner is amazing.

Dont fall for the slashed price on booking, the varied prices, or the 1 bed left!  theyre all scams. Its simply a clean hostel but without any amenities besides a pool. Its also expressly antisocial.

There is no hint of a kitchen  no fridge, cutlery, plates or bowls, no kettle, nothing. Just super overpriced menu items, even want to slug you for tea. In my experience the daytime staff were nice but less competent than average, and I found that their English isnt good enough to ask about anything. Night shift person was helpful though. There is a lift and free luggage storage.

The surrounding area is okay but a bit crass and the restaurants nearby are pretty touristy in a depressing way. Not being able to sort my own breakfast and having to go there was massively inconvenient.

This accommodation and area made me like Bangkok much less than I did before I came here. A regrettable choice to stay here. Wonderful gem of a property. While solo travelling through Asia, I would get a bit tired of hostels and would want somewhere more comfortable but not missing the social element of a hostel. This place is the perfect mix, it attracts younger travellers given the proximity to Khao San but at The same time feels like a very modern 45 star hotel. Super nice lobby area where people hang out, bed is extremely comfy, modern shower, great pool area. Only recommendation to the property is to provide better toiletries to complete the luxury feel. The hotel itself is overall very clean and the staff were helpful.
Kind of wish they had shelves or extra hooks on the bedside or in shower booths though.
The bathroom area didnt have an ac on so it was pretty damp and hot.
Other than that, everything was good! If I could rate this place 1010 I would! Last minute booking and we are so glad we booked here.
Staff lovely! Facilities new and clean! Really beautiful with a relaxed vibe. Coffee yum. Room service incredible after we were exhausted from the chaos of the city!
Beds MASSIVE and COMFY!!! Best so far of our trip.
Quiet aircon and peaceful environment.
Burger to chip ratio slightly off, but all and all would 100 book again. Great value for money Review 4 Dorm  2x 4 nights
Very nice HotelHostel, every day 1x free water und a new towel. The dorm  bed was very clean, comfortable and a good room size.  nice Breakfast Buffet as well
Only things to complainnote
1. the shower door could be renewed and the water didnt drain so well
2. some beds hadnt any space for my stuff in my bed like a shelf board or something, that was quite annoying and actually easy to implement.
3. Im about 1,94m tall and just about fit into the bed, someone taller should avoid the dorms probably one night should work",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Villa Bangkok Hotel,"457 Thanon Phra Sumen, Khwaeng Wat Bowon Niwet, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand",4.5,13.759097,100.5032333,"Rooms were an adequote size, lovely strong shower, fridge filled with refreshments not sure if there is a charge as we didnt use any of the drinks. The staff were very very friendly, helpful and all round amazing!!! The pool were big enough for a dip after a shopping session in the sun. The location were great, off the business of the markets, so relaxing after a busy day out. We stayed in room 113, right next to the pool. The hotel can also assist we cheap taxis to the airport! Will stay again on our next visit!!! .  Nice hotel, staff is friendly and helpful and location is good. Breakfast really delicious. Our room faced the street and we had to put up with all the noises and in addition there are AC compressors in the balcony concealed by some decorative panels. I was there to pick up my tourists so no rating on the room. In general, I do like the hospitality from the hotel staff, they are quite friendly. It was kind of coffee shop and breakfast inside the hotel reception too. The guests can have breakfast either in the caf with the air conditioning, ouside near the smoking area with the road view or quietly inside the hotel right next to the swimming pool. There is also the washing machine area where you can clear off your dirty clothes after several days for those who voyages many days. The hotel is well located nearby the Khaosan road by walk or Tuk  Tuk, there is 711 next to the hotel, so easy to get something quick. Unfortunately, the toilet at the lobby was only one person at a time. How to start i ask for a quite room and they gave one giving on the street.. but it was ok as its not a main road. Secondly walls are extremely thin.. its the first time in my life I heard literally the guy in the other peeing like if he were in my home room.. . The shower is super noisy especially by night. No night lamp next to bed and no trash in the room.
Finally for the same price you can afford something really better. The unique argument is the swimming pool but the water is so hot..
For those looking for quite place with respectable neighbours get you an other place Great Location and great stay. The place is  a cute vibe but mostly close enough to everything in Bangkok. We had a mix up with our reservation but they were able to let us hold our bags until we sorted it out. Would come back to this hotel.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Thaya Hotel Bangkok,"888 Phatthanakan Rd, Khwaeng Suan Luang, Khet Suan Luang, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10250, Thailand",4.4,13.7360169,100.6297942,"Large, clean rooms. Friendly staff in general. Very basic breakfast included, room service menu with few options. I ordered a margarita pizza, it tasted like ketchup. I DO NOT RECOMMEND it was a bad taste. As for location, I only recommend it if you are staying for 1 day and are going to the airport. Otherwise, you will spend money on taxis. Good value, good not too small rooms and great service. Lots of Chinese tour groups possibly worsen the experience. On the wrong side of the road if you want to go to Suvarnabhumi airport, in the rush hours the trip will take 20 minutes longer than from opposite side of the road. All in all I still recommend it! The room is so pretty! You can see the city view from it. The only downside is the location. It is not so easy to see since it was inside the corner. It's far from tourist destinations and shopping malls. They have a good breakfast though. EVERYTHING was absolutely unacceptable! The water was very unstable and kept changing temperature. Curtains and towels were stained and dust were cramped up into the air conditioning vents! Dust Pneumonia was very likely to happen so 1 star for this hotel!  I do not recommend this hotel by all the 5 stars hotel so far. If you are looking for a fair priced, clean, and most definitely safe hotel, this is NOT the place to come. Just checked in and of course the SoCal girl attitude in me came out when the bellboy corrected my teen daughter for not sitting up properly, on top of that he continued to keep his eyes on my daughter to make sure she didnt misbehave. Checked in the rooms, one is not ready and the other is hot as purgatory. I tried to play with the thermostat and of course the bellboy told me to not touch thats it, the 1 human replaced the 99 angel in me and Im about to check out. The receptionist handled it with great care. He calmed me down and corrected the issue without worrying about who is right and who is wrong. Thats impressive considering my ready to fight attitude.
The pool area was not ready as there is no clean towels and only dirty one left hanging around however it was immediately corrected when husband called for it.
Lets see if they can earn my 1 last star as this is my first day. I just left a beautiful 4 stars hotel in Da Nang, Vietnam with a 10 stars service. Lets hope this one can match.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Happy Station Bangkok,"477, 9-10 Thanon Rama IV, Khwaeng Rong Muang, Pathum Wan, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10330, Thailand",4.9,13.7381625,100.5175733,"The environment in the lobby was very chill, with a lot of interesting games for customers to play, including snooker. The room was super clean and comfortable. The location is strategic, as it is near the MRT. The staff are very friendly and helpful, especially the owner of the hostel. She even accompanied my friend to a nearby 7Eleven to buy medicine for me because I had diarrhea. In addition, she recommended some of the best local food that was suitable for my condition. I highly recommend travelers to stay here for their entire trip in Bangkok. The best hostel I've ever been to.

Clean, tables are not just wiped down, but with alcohol.

Huge sleeping places, wardrobes for things that can be closed, clean and highquality bedding. Lots of showers and everything is also clean.

There is an excellent restaurant at the hostel, free tea, water and they gave me iced tea for free.

Conditions for work, tables, soft sofas, lots of sockets for charging, a large hall on the first floor, a place outside.

Entry by cards, not everything in a row.

Just an excellent hostel, I recommend it without stopping I found Happy Station on Google Maps and decided to give it a shot. Best decision ever!
The room was airy, bright, and with a minimalist design that was both stylish and comfortable, bed was so comfy. And all staff were super friendly and helpful, even accommodating my request to pay a deposit in VND. Plus, it's located super close to MRT Hua Lamphong and Chinatown, making it easy to get around the city. highly recommend Happy Station to anyone seeking a cozy and welcoming place to stay in BKK.
Thanks a lot! i will work hard to comeback hereee  btw i miss the voice on MRT next station, Hua Lamphong Happy Station is easily one of the greatest hotels  hostels I ever stayed at in all my trips to Thailand. The rooms, bathrooms and shower areas are all very clean. All of the staff were very friendly and super helpful. The location is great and very close to MRT. I stayed here for about a week and I would definitely return if I have the opportunity, the beds in the dormitory are comparable to any 5 star hotel, they are extra large and very comfortable. Overall I am very happy with my stay here and would seriously recommend to anyone. 1010 A It was amazing. I think it was the best hostel experience I've had. Like a lil hotel room you get double bed, SUPER clean, curtains that give you complete privacy, strong AC at night but you don't get cold thanks to the curtains. I liked the fact that each room has its own bathroom, so you're sharing it with your roommates only.
The lockers are huge, which was a great bonus. The staff are super friendly and helpful  including the owner Lily.
I had an amazing rest in that place and I would definitely recommend it!!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
The Siam Heritage Hotel,"115/1 Surawong Rd, Khwaeng Suriya Wong, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand",4.1,13.7294648,100.5304817,"A bit old fashioned and dark and we had zero view from window. It's in a great location for the Pat Pong naughty nightlife and the people running it were lovely. It's clean and accessible to the rooms was easy with good security. The roof top swimming pool was surprisingly nice but I'd question if it was safe for small children. I would stay again. Heritage is correct. Old wood rustic floors and furniture. Comfortable enough. Its near the red light area and night market. Some good restaurants and several massage places. However they charge a large fee for guests. The exchange rate in front is low, go to the bigger busy exchange place two blocks down. This hotel is a gem.  Old world decor with teak floors, lots of dark stained woodwork and Northern Thai style stained glass makes the place feel like you're in an old movie with Humphrey Bogart.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Be sure to include the generous breakfast with your lodging, it is a great value and the dining room is quite charming.  I will definitely be staying there again.  You are close to the Sala Daeng BTS station.  Numerous restaurants are close by Ekka Indian Grill and Katshushin were two of my favorites. I arrived late at night and the overnight staff booked me into a standard room when I booked a deluxe king room, the room was on a lowfloor facing the street. The windows had no sound proofing and I was unable to sleep for that night due to the sound of loud constant traffic. Next morning I requested a quieter room and they moved me to the roomtype I actually booked on a higher floor facing behind the hotel where it was much quieter. However in the new room it had central AC which was extremely loud and never went below what felt like 25 degrees and the room felt very humid with stale air, the air con vents had alot of grime and dust, I developed a sore throat and cough during my stay, im not sure if it was due to the terrible air quality outside or the dirty condition of the central air conditioning I doubt they regularly cleaned inside it and is likely full of dust and other mould. The lamps on my bedside table were never dusted and some of the floorboards are uneven. The housekeeping was basic and was more about replacing ammenities and arranging things to look neat, instead of actually cleaning anything the housekeeper used a basic mop with water to clean the floors, probibly the same mop used for all other surfaces elsewhere in the hotel.

Overall the hotel is showing its age, the coriddoors are very dark with no windows. The choice of lighting within the rooms  public areas is a very cold sharp whitish bluelight that is very jarring to the eyes and sets a haunting atmosphere amongst depictions of old Thai cultural paintings and Buddhist inspired statues. The location is decent and a short walk to Thaniya mall, many dining choices  Sala Daeng BTS station, but at night especially its not a family friendly environment as you need to walk past Patpong market street full of tuktuk drivers  stripclubs or Thaniya road that is full of Japanese adultbars with many working girls calling your attention on the street, just to get to the BTS station. If you decide to call a Grab car, the drivers have a tough time locating the hotel and always stop on the opposite side of the busy traffic street. A very old n tired hotel. Everything is old n run down. I booked a executive suite n was quite surprised at how run down the room was. It has a musky smell.
The front desk guy was really impolite n grumpy.
The only nice thing about this hotel is the bell boy who is always smiling n will not hesitate to greet you.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

10 min walk to Sam Yot MRT

Pros
Good value  Worth the price
Comfortable Bed
Clean  Tidy
Good shower
Tea  Coffee Facilities downstairs

Cons
No safe
Rooms are tiny. Barely big enough for two people.
They cleaned our room when we had the ""do not disturb"" sign on.
Hairdryer was not great but better than nothing
No lift
TV wasn't a smart tv This is a nice hotel located in the quieter part of the Chinatown. It stands between a Japanese restaurant and a chic cafe in a row of heritage buildings.

There are eating shops, food stalls and a morning market near the hotel. The nearest MRT Blue Line station is Sam Yot, about 700m away.

The famous Wat Arun, Wat Pho, Emarald Buddha and Grand Palace are all within walking distance from this hotel. Khao San Road, a nightlife spot, is also nearby.

The room is clean and brightly lit. It comes with all the basic necessities including a hair dryer and a small fridge. However, there is no elevator and guests have to walk up the stairs to the 2nd and 3rd floor.

Checking in and out is simple and fast. The front counter staff, Ms Pan and Ms Nook, are polite and very helpful.

We enjoyed our five night stay here and would come back when we visit Bangkok again. This place is Fantastic. We stayed here for over a week.
The rooms are clean and spacious.
The common area has a functional pantry with electric water kettle and selection of coffee.
The bathrooms are also clean.
The best part is the hotel's location. It's just a stone throw away from the Red swing monument and amazing Wats.
The streets are lively . We  loved the vibes of this area. Highly recommend. Picked this hotel based on reviews and photos.  It looked like an interesting building, and the location is good.  A little disappointed with the room which was small and a little worn.  AC had to be kept on 247 to keep the room temperature bearable.  No elevator and we were on the 3rd floor.  We had a room with private bathroom which was small but sufficient.  Staff was helpful.  We booked a tour to Damnern Saduak floating market and the Train market.  No issues with tours.  Location is great.  Would not stay here again because Bangkok has many other options. Had an amazing stay at this place, very helpful front desk staffs.
Room was clean with daily housekeeping service
Had a quiet and cute space at the ground floor with kitchenette consisting microwave, water,boiler etc. along with tea and coffees

They let us checked in early at 10am which was so nice of them. Everyone was so friendly. Even provided umbrellas for guests to use, as platinum mall are near in walking distance around 1015 minutes. Only one thing is that the sofa pillow probably a bit dusty which made my skin itchy but nevertheless would really come back again next time.  If you're looking for a quiet area but still walkable to Tofu and shopping malls this hotel is perfect. The room is clean, quiet spacious, it also has a fridge inside.

Staffs are friendly and helpful. Great hospitality. The hotel also offers laundry service and free snacks for the guests. Had a very pleasant 3 nights stay here. Very recommended. Thank you! Amazing hotel, we enjoyed every minute there.
The room and the lobby were super clean, the room was big enough for the two of us. They can wash your clothes for free and you can take candies, chips or noodles in the lobby next to the elevator.
The site staff was so kind with us, we felt welcome and comfortable all the time, definitely this hotel deserves more than 5 stars.

Thank you for all your attentions hotel P18, no doubt I will return and stay with you again! This hotel exceeded my expectations! The staff was incredibly friendly, and the rooms were spotless. The pillows and towels were fresh and neatly packed, adding a nice touch to the overall experience. The location is fantasticjust a short walk to Siam. I highly recommend staying here! The service was excellent, the room very clean, got a lot of snack, they provided microwave, free laundry,. I enjoyed every second in here. Best Hotel so far.

The hospitality was amazing, especially Jack, who was welcoming me with a cheerful smile and great energy. The breakfast was exceptional. It was one of the best Ive had, even though I usually dont like hotel breakfasts. It's also just a 10minute walk to the metro station, which is perfect for active travelers. Wish I couldve stayed longer! Highly recommend. Great service and hygiene room. I stay at D2 for my birthday vacation trip.
One night when taking taxi back to hotel, i just got 1000baht on hand and taxi driver have no enough for change, i rush to the counter, the lady staff was on phone, but she noticed i am taking a 1k note and she counted the notes and changed for me while she was still on the phone. I was really appreciated for her help.
And on the day we left hotel, Jack at concierge was really helpful to call a cab for us to airport, but the driver is also running out of changewhere i expect the driver that accept airport order would have prepared enough change for customers. Thats all i wanna share in this trip 5 stars all around the hotel has a modern luxurious feel, breakfast provides enormous choice, the rooftop bar serves excellent cocktails, and the pool and gym are super well equipped. The staff is always friendly and kind, and Jack from the reception. found the new earphones we lost at the gym. A cab is required to most touristic landmarks, but Grab is super accessible. And there are many restaurants and massage parlours within walking distance. Highly recommend The hotel is new, with decently furnished rooms for its price. The shower pressure is amazing! Located a grabboltcab away from major attractions in a nice part of town or a free hotel tuktuk to the metrotrain and had a food market across the road from it open to 10pm12am. Overall for its price range will definitely stay here again. Special thanks to Jack and others tuktuk driver for taking us to the station frequently. I went for breakfast. The first feeling when entering was friendly from the entrance. The first thing I saw was the variety of food. There was a chef who took care of the food all the time and there were staff who were helpful and provided good information, especially Khun Beam and other staff. I can say that it was a delicious and quality breakfast, including a beautiful and clean dining room.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

If you are planning to come to Bangkok for tourist activities wouldn't recommend staying this far out of the city

Second time I have stayed here at this Centara. Whenever my wife and I have to make our annual trip to Immigration in Bangkok we have stayed here. Just a short walk away from Immigration so you can show up in the early morning to receive a low queue number.

Other than being close to the Immigration they have a great breakfast, lunch buffet and A La Carte options for food. As well it is a quick grab away from Charn at the Avenue which has a lot of food options and The M Lifestyle Mall.

Staff is always great there! This past time the room cleaners on our floor did an exceptional job, going over the top each day when they didn't need to.
Was able to meet one of them Naw. Thank you for your hard work Naw and was a blessing to meet you. Everyday Naw was asking if we had any trash to be taken out, asking if we needed extra waters and cleaning up our room when all we requested was for our sheets to be changed on one of our beds due to a accident from our baby

Couldn't recommend this place enough and excited to stay here again and other future Centara locations. Very nice venue, service and staff are great. Many thanks to Pop girl staff is nice and assist me a lot. I had the opportunity to conduct business at the Immigration Office in Building B. I was impressed by Mr. Nirut's guidance, as he provided excellent advice on the best route. The service was exceptional. Great Hotel, the room and breakfast was excellent. Very nice and friendly staff and i impressed especially from Mr Nirut. He was so helpful and friendly all the time when I stay there. Top 10 service. Our room 901 aircon was too loud so we were moved to a bigger room. The hotel maintenance agreed the engine needed change. I hope they do this as I have seen many reviews about this same problem. Will be coming back to this hotel in a few weeks so hope they have solved these issues.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Room 701 was huge. It even had a small kitchen with a microwave. The bathroom was super big. There aren't many places to put your clothes. The rooms are very thinly soundproof and the doors don't seal. Unfortunately, you can hear everything. Otherwise, the room service was always very good. The food is also very tasty. The staff are very young and lively. The pool is a bit small for the number of guests. Unfortunately, there were a few children in the pool when we were there. Very loud and wild, which is why we decided not to use the pool. But the children had a lot of fun.  I stayed there for 2 nights since the outstanding comments on social media and google reviews yet Id like to say Im quite disappointed mainly because of the room layout. Its different from the picture shown on the booking site Agoda. The long table in the room look like a workstation for me but Im here for vacation. I suggest placing a sofa there will be nice maybe?
The staff mentioned they could help me to switch room in the next day but I just stayed 2 nights so I preferred not to switch the room.

Despite the disappointing room layout, the service was fine, the staffs tried their best to accommodate my needs, the hotel itself is delicate, and I like the tuk tuk shuttle that is quite convenient. Im a solo female traveler and I felt safe all the time staying there. As a hotel manager, I can accurately judge the quality of an establishment, and it's rare to find one of such high quality, given the relatively high level of competition in Thailand. And yet! The Gardina achieved this feat in every respect. From the arrival and assistance of the luggage handlers, through checkin by the charming receptionists, to the cleaning of the room, there's nothing to criticize about this hotel, which is much appreciated by the Thai population. The hotel is located just a few minutes from the main Asoke intersection, in a quiet side street. The rooms are spacious, wellappointed and equipped with the latest technology to ensure you have a pleasant stay. Our attentive staff will greet you whenever you pass by. Don't forget to say hello back. The hotel's cleanliness is beyond reproach, and it will come as no surprise to find them hard at work at all hours. Well done to the manager for selecting the best staff and managing her team with talent. I plan to return when I move to Thailand and will take a month at this hotel to find my permanent accommodation there. If you're not sure about booking, don't hesitate, you won't be disappointed. I loved this hotel last year and cannot wait to get back there in January. The beds were comfortable, it was super clean and the pool was just lovely! News restaurant across the street was fantastic too. Wonderful hotel. I'm not satisfied with my overall experience with this hotel. I couldn't use the pool because of maintenance during my stay4 nights and 5 days and room attendant forgot to refill the towels and soap. Breakfast was only one menu per person and I was hungry so I asked for one more piece of bread and they said ""one person one menu"". and even drinks, they don't refill it. my mom wanted to have more juice and they said ""no refill"". one lady at the front desk was talking to me, chewing gums, totally not professional and not polite at all. the pool issue, this hotel had alternative, which was the next hotel's, and guess what? the morning we checked out, we couldn't use it because they didn't preorganize the facility with that hotel. so basically all the guests on that day were not able to use the pool at all. This is 4 star hotel and I have a expectation from here, I don't know why I should feel disappointed while I spend pretty good money here. and absolutely not recommend anyone to stay here.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Jono Bangkok Asok Hotel,"70 Soi Sukhumvit 16, Sammitr, Khet Khlong Toei, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand",4.5,13.733801,100.5609112,"Overall, I think it's a good value for money. I booked a slightly bigger room, but my room was on the 5th floor. I stayed for 9 nights.

Pros
 Most of the facilities are new.
 The TV is big and you can watch Netflix and YouTube well.
 The location is good. It's about 10 minutes walk from Terminal 21 and Asoke Station.
 Hot water comes out well and the water pressure is good.
 The road right in front is not a big road, so it's relatively quiet.

Improvements
 The worst thing about my stay here. It wasn't cleaned properly. The windows didn't open so there was no ventilation, and there was dust and hair on the floor, but they didn't clean it. If there had been improvements during my stay, I wouldn't have wanted to leave such a negative review. So I complained to the reception one day. And two days later, I asked for a makeup room, but the floor was still not cleaned.
 The room was relatively spacious, but there was hardly any place to put my luggage. I had to just put it in my luggage. The floor was dusty and there was no shelf to put my luggage on, so it was a total mess. There is space to put a shelf in the room, but is it difficult to put it that way?

At first, I liked it because it was costeffective, but as time went by, I was disappointed because its shortcomings were revealed. I hope the hotel management will accept my suggestions and make improvements. Nice design, great view from our room, comfortable rooms. Tbh not a whole lot of space in the rooms but great for flash packing. Lovely staff. Not my favourite area of Bangkok so much traffic!, but the hotel is on a quieter road and a decent option if you need MRT and SkyTrain access. Close to several malls. Nice lounge area with good coffee machine felt like a cafe. 55 The best hotel ever!
 Great location walking distance to MetroSky Train
 Good service mind staff even the auntie housemaid also give me a huge smile
 Comfy bed and I love their pillow!
 Self service coffee bar for free provide at the lobby
Highly recommend for everyone
who wanna stay in a downtown of Bangkok  Enjoyed my stay at Jono Hotel, its centrally located 5 minutes walk away from Terminal 21 mall and 2 min away from the 711. My room was clean and enough space for one person, hot shower and cold air con and a big tv with YouTube  Netflix. Staff are welcoming and also wanting to help. The lobby are has a coffee machine thats free and self service with a microwave as well. Overall one of the best budget options with a great location. Will definitely come back soon. So pleased we found this gem of a hotel in the heart of Bangkok. Perfectly situated, very clean and comfortable room. Great value for money and friendly staff.

Had a pleasant 4D3N here during July! Booked a connecting room with 2 double beds at an affordable price! Room is very clean and well maintained. The hotel is quite a walking distance to the nearest bts station, but theres a buggy car service to fetch u to the station. Would love to stay here again Very good experience here with excellent service from the staff at the concierge, buggy drivers and housekeepers. Location is great, walkable to main malls in the area and buggy service covers many amenities. Cleanliness is well maintained too, nothing to complain about in the rooms and they even change the towels daily. Great value and highly recommended. This hotel is really the most comfortable one I reserved in Bangkok.

We checked in really late in the evening but the staff there helped us with everything. The room is very clean and nice with refrigerator and safe, we didnt watch TV but they also have one.

The design of this NAP hotel is really modern, and its location is so good for going to the main malls in Bangkok, such as Siam Discovery, Central World.

By the way, they also provide delicious breakfast, and the amount of food is huge, compared to the other hotel we reserved in Bangkok.

Great thanks to the staff who drive us to the 4 stations this hotel have.

Really a nice experience in Bangkok. I don't actually stay here but my friends did. I visited their room, and it is okay. Got window but not really a view, the room is have decent space to open suitcase, soso in aesthetic for the room  weird placement of AC it's facing our face.

What i like is the lobby, pretty aesthetic with plenty of space to sit down and just chatting around. Not really have anything around the hotel, but within walking distance to the pratunam market  711. I walked at 2am from nap hotel to my own hotel in the market area, it's pretty creepy and nobody around. But once you get to the market area, it's pretty lively too at night.

But i think it's pretty safe area bcs there's still a lot of people going in and out the nap hotel in 1am when i'm chatting with my friends in the lobby. For a 3 star hotel, NAP hotel has exceeded expectations. I had a comfortable and well rested holiday in Bangkok while staying at NAP hotel. Hotel staff are hospitable and willing to assist, location of the hotel is good too with free buggy rides to nearby convenience stores etc.

THEE Bangkok by TH District,"9, 1 Soi Sukhumvit 20, Khwaeng Khlong Tan, Khet Khlong Toei, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand",4.1,13.7328671,100.5640535,"Great location. Good room and service. Breakfast was good too. The building was going through construction at the time and they only had one elevator to bring both the guests and workers. But I guess it couldn't be helped. Will likely book again in the future, hopefully after all the renovations are done. Fantastic little hotel, very modern, spacious, excellent room layout. Lovely staff and despite being under construction I still have no problem staying here as its way better than other 3 star hotels in the area. Highly recommended!
The WiFi is annoying though having to constantly sign in. The location is very good. Near the BTS Line and walk for approximately 500m to go to MRT Line.
We were staying at this hotel for 3 nights, and it was incredible. The staffs were nice, the room is big, clean and neat.
The hotel is under renovation but it will end on August 2024. this morning at 3 o'clock, I was given back my deposit with an old 1000 bath note which is no longer valid.  Already I wasn't happy with the very unpleasant smell of glue every week and then someone robbed me of my deposit by giving me an old 1000 bath note.  The person who gave me this note is a pretty strong person.  In any case, this is not the ticket I gave when I arrived!!  Can you investigate this theft of customers? For me, it's called theft, I can't reach you by email so I'm writing this review on Google. I stayed in 2 other hotels for the same price and this was my favorite one among the 3.

Room I stayed in both types of rooms. One is street facing with lots of sunlight but you can hear traffic noise even on the highest floor.

The back rooms from 6 and up are more quiet, but have no windows. So it's better for sleep.

Bed was soft and comfortable and AC was cold even on lowest settings. Water pressure from shower was decent for hotcold water.

Gym Is tiny can fit no more than 1 person comfortably. Thankfully I was the only one ever using it.

Staff Reception to be as accommodating as possible. When I was switching rooms they let me know so I didn't have to wait and was able to switch rooms directly. House keeperscleaners always greeted me with a smile.

Location Only 2 minutes from main road about a 8 minute walk to ASOK BTS and 10 minute walk to Terminal 21.

Finally remember to bring 1000 baht as a deposit!
I would stay here again next time I'm in Bangkok.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The name is misleading. It is not near the airport but in downtown Bangkok. The location was very good. I was able to walk to everything. They have a driver that can take you around also. You should definitely check out the rooftop! It is nowhere near the tallest building but it offers really great views and photo op!! Bottom line, a great overall experience for the price.  Easy walk to trains 3 min and immediately adjacent station from airport 12 hour.  Short walk to Platinum mall and other malls like Siam and Central only a train stop or two away but also walkable. Overall service is excellent. We stayed here for one night. First, the 1000 baht deposit seems exaggerated. The room didn't have a bedside table lamp or a light that could be switched off from the bed so you have to get up to switch onoff the kettle doesn't work apparently it's just 'decorative' so you have to get hot water from the hall the shower doesn't have a door or curtain and the shower head is low and points forwards instead of down. The bed was hard as a rock. The swimming pool water didn't seem very clean and there were no pool towels. On the plus side, the room was clean and the staff friendly. First time everything good all clean but only towel little smell not good I hope hotel should make towel more clean by hot sun or hot machine to make it dry if dry not well it will smell not good when use anyway no problem. Location good near market . Room enough for 2 people one bed shower room small but enough  staff good, I dont have any word more to say just recommend for you if want select this hotel is good for you and dont forget to swim before 7PM close.  see you again Top high airport link hotel. Really very bad experience. The photos shown in agoda app about the room is not real. Rooms are very small, one cannot move inside,bathroom can't stand also. Location also not good. Only one star because of staff politeness and behaviour. Please do not book this hotel. I don't know how agoda gave 8.1 for this hotel.

The rooms are very clean and the washrooms as well. The only problem I faced was when I got into the room it was super hot. I started the air condition and it took a long to cool off the room. Probably because of the window glass. But anyway I loved the space. Unlike nana road its not shady place Where the dorm is placed. And the nearby 711 was really good. The room was horrible not like the pictures all the furniture worn and musty no insight from the hotel to cancel my stay ! I would not recommend anyone to sleep there ! I did not get my money back. I left the hotel anyway. Better to sleep on the street than in that hole there Beautifully designed hostel, very modern and spacious feeling. Kept really clean!

Staff are really kind and helpful 

It's 15 min walk from Khaosan so very nice if you want a bit of space from the busy area, but near enough to walk easily.

I agree the beds are a bit hard but the rooms are really nicely designed and curtains give privacy.

Really enjoyed staying here!! I went there once, and it was a pleasant stay. The room is spacious, and it seems like a lot of service is being provided, including the laundry. The decoration is kind of modern, and back then we also had a very good view room. The location is a little far from Pratunam, yet if you prefer comfort and quiet sleep at night, this is recommended. There are many food stalls and seven elevens nearby, where you can easily find food for your hunger. The attraction is all around the corner yet requires a little walk. The position is not the best, around 15 minutes from the nightlife and the city center. But still an amazing hostel. The rooms were amazing and also the bathrooms were always clean. There are free towels and the wifi works perfectly. There's everything you need from a good hostel. Reccommended!!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Before booking I saw that there were a few reviews about cockroaches and bugs being there and I messaged the host and she told me its because some people leave food inside of the apartment and thats why the bugger comes in but if you dont leave any food, then it should be OK. so I thought that reasonable. But the moment that I arrived, there were already bugs inside everywhere. Everywhere little and big there was a few dead cockroaches inside of the bathroom. The building is full of drug smell everywhere. It smells like marijuana. Location is completely not safe for solo traveler I got followed by twice one of the times somebody almost SA me in the elevator. And I immediately left the day after this place is not safe. This building is not safe and rooms are completely outdated and the walls are too thin. You can hear EVERYTHING from next door. Absolutely avoid this place. We booked airBNB here, on the 27th floor. Yes there are some working women from africa. And they stay at the lower floors mostly. One needs to understand that each appartment is in private ownership. Some apartments may be very good. Other may be bad. The location is very good and close to night life and all within walking distance They got a big problem with cockroaches..
Bad smell in the bathroom..
Furniture really bad condition.
No Wifi..the heat plates in the kitchen didnt work..when you look closer you can see black mold at the pool..its in the red light district..building is from 2007 but appears like its from the 80s.. Location is convenient, active nightlife neighborhood with lots of tourists, cafes, and restaurants. However, its always traffic here. Rooms and amenities are pretty old, AC is not working in their gym. Cockroaches in garbage room and you can also find them in rooms. This is older hotel, but not bad.

CASCADE HOTEL BANGKOK,"92-1 Krung Thon Buri Road, Banglumpu-Lang, Klongsan, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10600, Thailand",4.5,13.7205875,100.4976481,"I went to Bangkok for meeting nearby this hotel. This is absolutely fantastic. Hotel is very super modern very new. Very comfortable. I fall asleep on this. The bed is really good. there is the bar there. and rooftop for cocktails. So both of them I don't have the time to go there. For me, I like how they do the service. Look like five stars the room are very quiet. In my room is all can use hundred percent no complain everything has been clean up very well. I have some meeting there again probably I will go back to this hotel again.

for something to eat a lot of things nearby to eat as a local food like Thai food I recommend to go to eat a local force which is very famous Ka Prao 1998 bed just across the street and follow by the maps so you will go and see a lot of people there  and some other choice you can go 7Eleven and not too far as well can go in the back side of the hotel or just stop at the lobby. Where is it? so many choices no worry for the food while are you staying here

Actually, when they go there, the price are not too high and I stay alone  at reception is very good staff and the doorman taking care as very, very well and all of them recognize me since arise until the last day check out

Very impressive for this hotel
Everyone stay here Stayed at the Cascade Hotel 3 times now.
Love the staff they are very friendly.
The beds are clean, one time my sheets had stains, but after I complained theyve send housekeeping and changed them.
Unfortunately the floor wasnt cleaned properly, it was sticky and in the bathroom there was mold on the ceiling, which was quite disappointing. I dont understand why they assignned me to the room where the engineering and housekeeping did the general maintenance or whatever it was in the next rooms. Even their equipment was here and there in the corridor. Dont you care about guest convenience?
There was no tv control in the room.
And sadly this 4 stars hotel doesnt even have a single baby chair. The air is not cold, as the ac was placed by the front door and not the room. Service by the workers at the front door is fine, but the front desk are full of liars. They always say they do not have towels, room cards, or even toilet paper. They say  I will bring it to you. But they never come. I used to love staying here. But the last time, I didnt get to check in until 6pm because the rooms were not ready, however they didnt want to give us a late check out, not even an hour. Will never stay here again. They are completely understaffed, and management sucks. From my experience I do not suggest this hotel.

When we checked in the staff in the reception told us a 500 Tai Baht or equivalent is needed as a forced deposit for foreigners.

We ordered a room with breakfast, but the interesting thing here is we need to write down exactly when we will have breakfast. The portion of the breakfast is so less than I expected.

Its true they have a pool, but it is just a kind of shallow water.

Compared to the price we ordered we dont think this hotel is worth the money.","Monday: Open 24 hours

This hotel is located near to Thong Lor BTS station, about 57mins walk away. Both the hotel's exterior and interior gives the industrial vibes.

Checkin was a breeze, even though i reached earlier than the stipulated checkin time. I was assigned to a room on the fourth level. Upon entering the rooms, it gives off a cozy feel as the room was dimly lighted. Room was rather clean and condition of the room was well maintained. The toilet and bathing area is separated. The bed although was not the best but was comfortable for a night of sleep. The staff at the reception table were friendly and made me felt welcome. There are 2 711 nearby, both about 5mins walk away.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are planning to stay in Thong Lor area. At first we were not sure whether to stay here for 5 nights or shorter because of the pretty varied reviews. But we decided to just gave it a try. Firstly, bec we like staying in smaller local hotels and secondly, the rooms in their website looked pretty cute. It was a totally right decision! The staff are so hospitable, the hotel and especially our room was more spacious than expected. The bed was so comfortable and cleanliness was great. We were not disturbed at all by the traffic noise and always slept like a log.
We booked directly to their site and Watcharee, the staff, was highly responsive. We booked the wrong dates and had no problems at all rescheduling the booking. She also helped with taxi arrangement for a return trip to the Ancient City, which was more reasonably priced than other car rent applications.
The other staff I can't remember the name of sorry for this, did his best in assisting us with directions and transport to take.
We will not hesitate to return to this hotel again in our next visit!! Amazing stay in a quiet area. Checkin was super easy and smooth. I arrived earlier than 2pm but my room is already ready for me to check in. Nam, the receptionist, was the friendliest and helpful person I've met in Bangkok.
The room was amazing. Clean, spacious with a dose of lush nature. Love how the wc and shower are separated. Everything in the room worked fine, and they even provide an extension power with international plug in case you need it.
No breakfast is provided but it was fine, there's a bakery cafe at the ground level if you are looking for coffee and bread. Nam introduced me to the early market nearby for local food, which was commendable. The hotel provide cab service too at fixed price, but cash only.
Highly recommended. Service is definitely praiseworthy! Agreed with the others on this part. We hope the management will continue to take good care of the staff here.

No complaints on the rooms as we've been informed if we want a quieter room as light sleepers, the deluxe bedroom is good. I suppose the only downside of the rooms is that we can hear doors closing and noises the hallway pretty audibly, so if there are inconsiderate guests making noise in the wee hours, then that may affect your peace a little.

The hotel is actually located in an upper class residential area but the way the place is designed is that you can also see the 'rugged' side of Bangkok as well from here. The interesting part of our trip is that we actually walked from the hotel all the way to the Commons on the other side  VERY GOOD.  CLEAN. 5 mins walk to Phrom Phong BTS.  Super convenience.

It's far from the city but they do offer good price . And good room . No kettle or tea bags . If u ask them for tea bag they charge 40 TB .otherwise good rooms. They have two good restaurants near by Hotel is fine. Setback is the surroundings. Road are narrow to walk. 24hrsstore ideally located. As hotel r in the middle of long stretch that leads to the boat ferry. I took the ferry and transfered to another all the way to end for 20baht. That leads to 25mins to khaoSan or 15mins to Dinso. Impressed every time I stay! I stay here regularly when I go to concerts at Rajamangala National Stadium. It's convenient, affordable, and the staff are great. The rooms are clean and spacious. Worst hotel I ever been! Doors doesnt scan cards, every time you come from outside to hotel you have find hotel stuff to open your door and you have to wait around 10 min to stuff come.

The room service was excellent, with daily towel changes and regular supplies of shampoo and bottled water. Nearby, there are plenty of supermarkets 7Eleven, Tops Daily and restaurants like McDonald's. However, the WiFi was disappointing, with weak signals and frequent disconnections. Improving this would enhance the overall experience. Due to the WiFi issues, Im giving a fourstar rating. Well located accommodation with good service. They provide new towels, mineral water and shampoo everyday during their room service. Respond fast to our inquiries. Facilities like lobby seats and pool was prepared. Mrt station is at a walkable distance. Connected to the hotel was massage shop, restaurants and bar. Convenience stores are nearby. Only a 10 minute walk from the metro, pretty well situated. Rooms were okay, nothing to grab about other than AC. Unfortunately can't review the pool, but the bar down the road was excellent too. Giving 5 stars to improve general score bcz this hotel deserves better reviews!
BIKEPACKER FRIENDLY
Meaning I can safely leave my bicycle inside my room.
Clean hotel and stuff coming every day to clean the room if you allow or want.
It is totally fine for the price!
Best is hard and I like it.
It is very quiet.
The location is very good.
7 eleven is nearby, McDonald's is nearby... Everything is relatively close. It is a huge city so bare that in mind!
Stuff is nice.
Yeah there is no internet so what. I have 2 local sims and working good.
No mistake for normal people for this hotel! Horrible place. It was kinda clean, exept bathroom but whole place is run down. Not suitable to any kinda standars. At same price there must be someting better...I pay for 5 nights but bugger off after one night, not even ask refunds. Hopefully they spend that money wisely...","Monday: Open 24 hours

I was lucky to find this hostel back in 2022 during my month exploring Bangkok. Silom is a great area to explore and this hostel was very clean, the rooms spacious and the staff very welcoming. Went back last year and if I find myself in Bangkok without a place to stay while trying to save money you can be sure I'll be back here! Fond memories The warm window had a great location. Everything was nearby, so many restaurants within 200mtrs. The money exchange counter was 50 mtrs away.

The room was smaller than expected, but it was quite comfortable. They offered breakfast as well, which was a plus one. They had no lift and we had to carry our bags to 3rd floor, which was okay but good to mention. Maybe I didn't read the website well. Also, it was a cash only place. Again, I'm not sure if it was mentioned, but it's good to keep some extra money in hand if you go there.  The people there were friendly and we were in the middle of everywhere we wanted to go.  The washrooms were clean and nicely kept.

Overall, it was a good experience. One of the best Hostel I have stayed at.. Very good staff, free breakfast, Ac, common area, rooftop and all other facilities were really good. There is a mosque in walking distance and a bus stand for transport. Really friendly staff, clean and spacious dorm rooms, clean, warm showers, and a lovely complimentary breakfast. Great hostel for the price, I cant believe I only paid 291 baht for the night! Good location to explore Silom, and it definitely feels more safe than other places Ive stayed in Silom. The only thing I would say is the bed is a little hard but so are most beds in Thailand. A 1010 stay  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the dormitory room, and I would like to express my appreciation for the fantastic experience. The facilities were not only clean but also wellmaintained, creating a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. The staff, under the supervision of Ms.Asama truly stood out with their exceptional service.

Ms. Asama, the supervisor, deserves special recognition for her outstanding management skills. Her attention to detail and dedication to ensuring a high standard of service were evident throughout my stay. Whether it was addressing inquiries or resolving concerns, she handled everything with professionalism and a welcoming attitude.

I highly recommend this dormitory for anyone seeking a comfortable and welcoming place to stay.","Monday: Open 24 hours

However, the receptionist wasnt very helpful when we asked for a brush they said they were going to let housekeeping bring it to our room but after awhile we called they said we have to pick them up ourselves at the receptionist desk. The hotel is quite far from any where not much around it. Overall, the room was comfy but others are meh We stayed here for a few nights whilst visiting Bangkok. The surrounding area and the hotel seem disconnected as the hotel is exceptional and quite complimentary which cannot be said for the immediate surroundings. That being said the locals, vendors  street food directly next to the hotel are amazing. The staff and security were also very attentive and supportive.

The room I had was amazing and to a very nice standard. Lots of isolated light switches so you can set the tone and mood for the room. The TV was good and had international channels and there was a small workspace in the room which I used for my computer set up. My only negative is that there was no room chairs so I had to borrow one from the workspace but thats all really.

There is a pool on the ground floor, its not ideal for a good swim but perfect for a little dip or just to splash around. There is an open lounge area with very comfortable day beds for you to relax in. The gym is basic but has the essentials you need to get a decent work out. There is nice workspace area for you to get some work done also.

All in all we were very happy staying and would stay again despite it being a little out of the way from the main areas of Bangkok it was a very nice and pleasant stay. Most valuable hotel in Bangkok. Great room and facility. Located on the crowd street but a peace will be found in this place. The room was great, you cant ask more for a better amenities. The mint shower gel was great too, feel relax and refreshing. The Front office team is friendly as well as Mr. Security grad is very helpful and professional. It was a great moment, great choice despite all terrible problems I went through on that day. Lovely stay! The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable, and the aesthetics of the entire place were truly pleasing. However, theres room for improvement with the breakfast offerings. We only dined once during our stay due to this. Overall, a great experience! Dorm room very tidy and spacious. Good working area and pool for work and chill. Location a bit lacking.

Less than 10 minutes walking distance to Central Rama 9 Shopping center and 12 minutes to Rama 9 Hospital.

The Deluxe room for two people is nice. It comes with a private bathroom, AC and hairdryer.

The living room or kitchen area is also my favorite, you can use all the plates and bowls but have to clean up everytime after use, which is fair enough. You can also put your food in the fridge, there is a marker there, just put your name on it.

The staff is very nice, she provides all information for me probably because I can speak Thai. She recommends to download Grab application.

I ordered a pack of water to my room which save a lot of energy to carry them from the shopping mall.

Overall, the location of this hostel is perfect and reasonable price. The rooms are neat, tidy, and clean. It's situated in a European Town.
The host was very accommodating.
5 min walk to MRT and Jodd Night Market. It's very good and comfortable hostel. I can walk to Rama 9 mall in 5 mins Nearby airport line and environment safety is good. Room and bathroom is clean Best Hostel Ever!!

I would like to start by saying this Hotel is not that bad, room is very spacious and bright, stuff provided are relatively clean, and location is decent bed is quite hard, and mediocre sound proof

BUT for the 5 nights I have booked I was assigned to Room 403, and I believe the piping for the building is very old, the constant smell of sewage keeps gushing in from the toilet drain holes there are 3 of them Hotel staff did try to help by placing more fragrance, and putting wet towels on top of the holes, but the smell is just too strong and it was like that for my entire stay.

I tried asking for a change of the room, but was told all rooms are fully booked. I was constantly worried about the rotten egg smell from the sewage gas, as it could pose a health hazard which may contain sulfur content.

I would have rated this hotel a 4 star but the constant smell of sewage in a room WITHOUT windows is just absolutely disgusting, and made my stay here terrible. 1 star describes fully my experience here. Bad location, no street food or nearby 711. Train station also 510mins walk away. workers are nice n friendly, rooms got a bad smell and Aircond not very cold in room 505 The hotel is very comfy and nice, service is over the top, especially Fai at reception, she has been very helpfull during my whole stay. Over all great value for money.. 1. Location they said its close to BTS station, its but still need to walk 1015 minutes. The closest one is Chongnongsi in front of King Power Mahanakon.  The place is in the Plaza building so many office and restaurant etc there.
2. Room HUGE room. Love it. The amenities more than enough. Toot brush, comb, razor, they will set up on bathroom. Coffee, tea and they will give you MILO chocolate so good!
Pajamaskimono, and one thing for sure alot of pillow, and they all soft so good, they provide AIR PURIFIER in the room too.
3.etc i got room with fake window. So there is no sunlight from outside world.
4.many restaurants there, and they have rooftop bar also. So its good.
711 or other mini market its far from this area!

They will ask you put deposit 1000bath before check in.","Monday: 6:00 AM – 2:00 AM

Staff are very attentive and friendly. They are extremely helpful. Rooms are lovely and clean. Definitely worth the stay! Excellent hotel. Rooms are of very high standard! Everything is new and clean. Comfortable beds. Universal sockets so no need for adapters. 3040 mins to BKK by taxi. We all really satisfied all conditions of the hotel.
City view is great and all bed room's conditions are good.

Just one thing, our room was just besides of the main road so it was little bit noisy. But still reasonable to stay.

If you have a car, no problem at all. But if not, you need to call the grab taxi.

We would like to visit again. Good service provided! When asked if there is any car that we can book for half a day with a driver, they managed to find an affordable option  Snack and drinks provided at the lobby area too. Only problem was the aircon was leaking after 2 days of stay there. Great, clean place! Attentive service. I booked 5 nights. It has indoor pool and gym. Great mirror in bathroom. Big faconett.

This is a small but very friendly place to stay. The room itself was very clean, a good size and had a good amount of space. Everyone working at reception was very helpful. This isn't by any means a place to stay in the city centre, however there is a BTS station around 15 minutes walk away which we used a few times to get into Central Bangkok. The only criticism we would have was the bed this was by far the most uncomfortable one we had in Thailand be warned, the bed is VERY firm. However if you want a quiet place to stay for the night, this is a great option. I was on a solo budget trip, stayed at one of the private rooms for two nights. Impressed with how everything is clean and organized.  The staffs speak perfect English. Really good vibes plus, rooftop dining. Great value. Think it will be fun to stay at the bunk rooms with friends or even get some friends from there. Great affordable place to stay especially for those on a budget. Its very clean and the staff is incredibly kind and welcoming. My only gripe was that the beds were the most uncomfortable thing Ive slept on. Its a thin mattress and while there are dividers between the beds they dont block any noise.
The keys were also a little frustrating, while it was amazing that we had been given not one but two places to put our belongings you cant tell which key is for which storage so you end up fiddling with them a lot.
If you book here I suggest getting the private room with a friend. Great location and all around good hostel but the beds are hard as ROCK, and they stuck us in a room with staff living in it and another man whos been living there for 4 yrs, so there was so much stuff in the room and not like the photos. Personally I think because we were staying for so long compared to other ppl in the hostel we should have been given a different room. Definitely wont be going back solely due to the beds As a solo female traveller, I felt safe. The location was in the heart of the city. There was easy access to malls. The cafe was cute and food was REALLY good. In the night, you can see the city lights on the roof top.. my bed was also quite spacious","Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Apart from the location being slightly away from the city center, which is still easily reachable via the MRT Blue Line mostly used by locals, this hotel offers a nice break from the busy Bangkok traffic. It feels like stepping into a slower pace of life and enjoying some quiet time. The hotel's industrial interior gives off a hipster vibe, with young adults hanging out and sharing in many open spaces like the kitchen, living room, and lobby. They even have their own small cafe that serves delicious mealswe got to try their breakfast and lunch, and both were lovely. We only stayed for two nights, so we missed out on trying their spa massages, which looked so relaxing, and we couldn't join the painting workshops due to our tight schedule in Bangkok. That was the sad part for us because the hotel has a really good energy and a lot to offer. It was such a great and relaxing experience. I went for a 3day solo retreat, I felt my inner peace was full filled. The are shared dorm rooms mixed and women and also private rooms. The bed was comfy and provided more than sufficient space to roll around. The staff were super nice and chill. There is also a massage palor in house as well, but I didnt try. Over all Im loving it and will go back with a company or two 

Oh there are 2 chubby emotional support at least for me dogs to hug. I think they are introvert or shy. Wow. Beyond what I expected. Staff are amazing, so kind and willing to help so much. Great atmosphere. Great people. Many activities, such as painting, jewellery making and they have Thai massages available. The aesthetic of the place is simple beautiful. Wooden and so many plants all around. It felt so cosy and peaceful. And last of all great location near train station as well as delicious restaurants. Thank you  I will be back!!! spent 2 nights at Tamni and it was wonderful. the staffs are very very friendly and helpful. the room, facilities and bathroom are very clean and comfortable. it is located at a backstreet and its very quiet and peaceful. i even have the urge to go back sometimes when im at the busy town area. its just so relaxing to stay. theres a cafe serving good coffee and massage place just beside Tamni which i highly recommend too! An amazing hostel! Great atmosphere and service, painting and other classes and things to do. All very green and beautifully designed.

I got a very good service and a very good room. The room is very comfortable, big, ac works great and very relaxing feeling at the hotel lobby.
The place is close to the Kawasan Main Street and yet very quiet.
I recommend this hotel to anyone. A good place to stay in Bangkok. A bit noisy at times, as the windows were thin. The bed was a bit firm as well and the shower was broken. Otherwise a good room in a good location, close to Khao San road and close to the pier. Very bad experience actually, I really dont recommend.
Price not cheap compared to other better options around.
Very noisy coming from outside and inside as you can hear people in other rooms talking and coughing you may check the uploaded video here.
Very basic rooms with no facilities at all, and not very clean as some smell coming from the ground made of cement.
Location is far from the malls, city center and activities.
Friendly and kind staff, i think its managed by a family living in same place. Auntie and the staff were super friendly and welcoming. The rooms are made to feel homely. I guess you can say it feels like your home away from home. Rooms are clean, not too big but enough room for multiple luggage if needed. I definitely would stay here again if I was in the area. The location is perfect, just in the heart of Bangkok, but surprisingly very quiet! You cannot hear the traffic noises at all. The room vas very clean and the bathroomshower is working great!

We had to leave our previous hotel nearby because it was so bad and we took the last room. The room was well kept and clean, and location was very convenient  none of our bolt grab drivers had any difficulty finding us. We enjoyed our stay for 5 nights  Came for a short holiday. Hotel staff were fantastic, especially, Lindsay  Nate. Check in was a breeze and even provided advice on how much to pay for tuktuk and taxi. Rooms were also always made up on time. Will stay again in the future. The  hotel location is perfect. The hotel staff are very welcoming and smiley. The hotel lobby smells good. The room is very clean and spacious enough to roam around and open our luggages. We slept comfortably. It is near 711, the Pratunam Market, the Platinum Mall, Big C Supermarket and many more. There are food restaurants outside as well and very accessible for Bolt and Grab pickup. Overall, we loved our stay and we will be back  Thank you! The room is super clean with a strong air conditioner. Very quiet. No bad smell. The mini bar is free and you can get a cappuccino for free too. The receptionist is very helpful. The location is good if you want to go to Platinum often, but I found a stay at Phrom Phong is much more comfortable especially if you bring kids. The location is actually very convenient if you want to go to Pratunam market, Platinum mall, and Decembers. Also, if you want a massage its just steps away from the hotel.

My husband and I stayed 2 nights here. Service is wonderful. Staff is super friendly and helpful. The room comes equipped with most of the amenities. We paid for a queen bed room but they upgraded us. Their check in was smooth even though we arrived around 130am.

We paid for the breakfast and it was worth it if you are doing any sightseeing. Had a good variety of Asian and continental breakfast. Decent coffee as well.
There is also a good Thai massage spa connected to the hotel and it was convenient after a long day of sightseeing.
Location of this hotel is really close to all the things you want to see in Bangkok. Good hotel overall. Modern feel and very clean. Large rooms. Had a good experience staying there.
Breakfast options are sufficient and enough choice for different taste.
Staff are friendly, especially Mr Sushi always has a bright mood.
We had a few issues with the shower not draining properly or some sockets not working but they were swiftly resolved from the maintenance team the hotel uses and app which is quite neat.
It has a pool, albeit not very large its nice for a quick dip or lounge for some relaxation.
What we didnt like was that the one evening we wanted to use their noodle bar in the evening they had cleared it early which was disappointing. Also the buffet breakfast was cleared before the advertised time.
Overall can recommend this hotel. It is safe and has security staff outside 24 hours.
Its a walkable distance to Khaosan Road or use their free TukTuk service. Also Taxi to any of the malls or attractions are inexpensive. Very friendly and helpful staff. Extremely clean hotel. I was upgraded upon my arrival and when I needed to stay an extra night, I was told to book online to save money, however the only rooms available were double bed size and I was in a superior king room, which I was able to stay in and didn't have to move to another room. Really great experience. Thank you  I had a fantastic stay at Centara Life Hotel in Bangkok. The rooms were extremely clean and wellmaintained, which made me feel comfortable and relaxed throughout my visit. The hotel features a relatively large gym, perfect for keeping up with workouts, as well as a beautiful and clean swimming pool. The atmosphere of the hotel was wonderful, and I was genuinely impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of the staff.

Omo and the entire restaurant team delivered outstanding service, always attentive and ensuring we had everything we required.

In summary, I highly recommend Centara Life Hotel to anyone planning a trip to Bangkok. I must give this hotel a fivestar rating. A mediumsized hotel has a fivestar standard. The service is very friendly and makes you feel at home.  I lost my wallet on the last day and immediately informed us as we headed to the airport. We are very grateful.

Kids love the place especially the bunk bed.
It would be good if the in room has 2 toilets but we went well with 1 too. No big issues.
Will definitely come back to stay again. Bangkok's traffic is quite congested. This hotel is also very good to let the driver pick me up. The waiter was also very considerate and prepared a surprise birthday cake for me when I was leaving. The service was impeccable and very thoughtful. Best best hotel that I stayed in. Very respectful staff. Breakfast was the best. Location is good too. From the hotel you can walk to malls.  Rooms were very clean. Everything was beyond my expectation. Good job to all the staff working in the hotel. You guys are amazing! I recently stayed here during my visit to Bangkok for the ACL 2024 conference, and I was thoroughly impressed by the level of service and cleanliness. From the moment I arrived, the staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist with any request I had. Their professionalism truly enhanced my stay.

The room was spotless and wellmaintained, with a comfortable bed and all the necessary amenities. The attention to detail in the rooms upkeep was evident, and it made my stay extremely comfortable and enjoyable.

What really stood out was the perfect location in the city center. Being so close to major shopping malls and the conference venue made it incredibly convenient to navigate Bangkok without the hassle of long commutes. It was ideal for someone like me attending an international conference.

Although I did not have the chance to try the breakfast or dinner, the overall experience was outstanding. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bangkok, especially if youre attending a conference and need a clean, comfortable, and welllocated place to stay. I stayed one night here and, I wish I had booked this hotel since I arrived in Bangkok.

Special thanks to the hotel management for making our day. Highly recommend it for family or honeymoon trips.

They create a great atmosphere and made a delicious coco This is our favorite hotel in Bangkok! We really appreciate the team and especially Nat who always did its best efforts to help us! Rooms are clean and very nicely decorated, the bed are really comfy! We will go back when in Bangkok for sure!! Also, you can take the breakfast until 5pm which is really convenient!! Very impressed with the hotel, service their attention to detail. Will revisit again, potentially a great hotel in the the region. Breakfast spot on flavours, their bar is really nice.

Fantastic location, walking distance to all the temples and Khao San road. Staff is very nice. The rooms and showers are clean. Youre given a towel when you check in and the showers have soap and shampoo. Two lockers, one below your bed to store your bag and one small one attached to the wall. Super comfy beds. You need your key to access the elevator at night, so you feel safe. Continental breakfast in the morning is a plus. Highly recommended! It's OK. A little bit weird atmosphere.
Nice shared facilities but small and not too welcoming.
They were quite rude about keeping the bags after check out. They said they will only keep them for 4 hours past check out. I think it's a bit extreme most hostels are much more generous with that.
Beds are really good, with privacy curtains. Vivit hostel is awesome! Most importantly the staff are so caring and helpful Ive never experienced better.
You cant really tell if its a hostel or hotel, the beds are so comfortable and everything is perfectly clean and inviting. There is a great free breakfast coffee, juice, toast, bananas, eggs very helpful in the morning in Bangkok.
The street is also perfect proximity to everything locally, markets, restaurants, temples and about 30min or more walk to the huge malls  crazy city centre. First hostel stay, was very impressed. Clean rooms, bed was comfortable, and friendly staff. There is AC in each room which is individually controlled. AC in the lobby and lounge only works in the evening and the rest of the building doesn't have any so it's always hot outside of your room. Breakfast is very basic, toast, hard boiled eggs, crackers, juice, tea, and bananas. No cereal, milk, or meats. Good location though, short walk to temples and Koh San road. Recommended for a few nights, just expect that the breakfast selection will get old quickly. Great spot with friendly staff and travellers, very comfortable beds and super clean rooms and bathrooms, and they do a very good frappe latte too 

The location is perfect, you're close enough to Khaosan Road nightlife if you want to do that, without having to stay on the road itself with thumping clubbing music all night. You're also close to lots of temples and plenty of good cheap food.

Good communal areas too, with a nice air conditioned mezzanine lounge to relax in when the rainheathumidity gets too much.

The beds all have their own curtain, power outlets and light too. It's all been designed nicely.","Monday: Open 24 hours

I recently stayed at the bedever bangkok boutique hotel and found it to be a great choice for travellers looking for a simple and affordable option in the heart of Bangkok. The hotel is conveniently located near several major attractions and BTS public transportation, making it easy to explore the city.

The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet, with all the amenities you need for a short stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially Jack  Fah.

While the hotel may not offer luxurious amenities, it more than makes up for it with its great location, fair prices, and welcoming atmosphere. If you're looking for an uncomplicated and budgetfriendly option in Bangkok, I would definitely recommend the bedever bangkok boutique hotel. The room is very spacious.

I have to thank her very much. I will definitely come back to stay here. Romantic and lovely room, kind staff, strategic location overlooking at train station and many restaurants.

Bed mattress quite hard for our liking. Yes you can hear the noise from khaosan road clubs etc well into the early hours of the morning! We asked for a ""quiet room"" and was given 216. You can still hear the bass but it was bearable and we both slept. Reception staff not the friendliest but I don't think I would be either if I had to listen to the noise all shift. Cute coffee shop directly outside reception. Didn't use the pool. For 16 a night, can't complain too much! I wouldnt recommend staying here versus other similar properties on the street. First and foremost I specifically booked because of the pool which has been close for months yes they give you an option to go to another hotel to use theirs but I was looking forward to having one super close. They should mention this before booking. As for the room there is plenty of space and the bathroom is nice. But the bed is terrible and as others have mentioned sleep will be difficult because it is so loud outside. The location is perfect if you want to party and the staff were nice and efficient. Hotel is good. Rooms are decent size with plenty water and includes fridge. Location is perfect for access to the madness on Khaosan Road. Only negative but really isnt a negative is the noise. It can get loud and stay loud until late hours of the night. But if your out and come back after a few drinks this wont be a problem. Rooms were great, Clean, roomy and comfortable.  The raging  street party outside of the hotel on the main street is just outa control. Super loud music that you can hear  in most rooms thru the hotel till 330  400  in the morning.  NOT the fault of the hotel Very loud , if you like to party great  spot , but if you are a older person and try to sleep  it is not ao great music places to 300am every single night.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The room has been very clean and cozy. Surely it is not very big but definitely enough. The staff have been very kind and friendly. Indeed the rooms are not very soundproof but definitely to endure.

You can have a good time at the rooftop bar and use the pool from the hotel across the street. Overall a good priceperformance.

The neighborhood around is very calm and offering nice restaurants. And if you want to go wild Khaosan Road is just a couple of minutes away. This hotel is incredible! The staff is super helpful, the art deco in the whole hotel is super amazing. The room is beautiful, but a little bit small in size, but super comfortable. Rooftop bar has an incredible view. The restaurant serves a tasty and complete breakfast.  Definitely, I will be back! Also is a walking distance to Khao San Road or to the boat pier where you can get the boat bus to reach all the sightseeing points. We stayed here one night before catching the train to the north. I was very very impressed with the hotel. Our room was monkeythemed and my wife explained that it had to do with Thai folklore. The rooms are really nice and exceptional clean. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and professional as well.
Sorry I didn't take any photos but please believe that you will not be disappointed. We will stay there again whenever needed. Definitely recommended!
The location is very convenient, you can walk to Khaosan within 10mins, but still quiet enough. Room is clean and nice too the lighting a bit dim but no problem.
The staff are superrr cute, friendly and helpful, providing us with a lot of information for commuting, tour, and helping us to handle the luggage when we were rushing to check out. The rooms are stylish but really small, there is no balcony and  no any way to get fresh air as the windows dont open. It was generally clean. The neighbour didnt seem nice at all but it has many local restaurants and as far as I understood it was near the center . The staff was generally kind but unfortunately the breakfast was the worst I ever had in Thailand, they did even had basic things and I couldnt communicate with the staff of the breakfast as they didnt spoke English. The swimming pool at the near hotel was good","Monday: Open 24 hours

Highly recommended!

I definitely be back when I have a chance to go back to Bangkok again! I stayed for one night and the room was spacious and felt exclusive. The rooms had separate airconditions to acommodate for individual needs. The overall attention to detail as well as the exquisite service and proffessional staff made my stay somewhat extraordinary. I will definitely be back whenever I go back to Bangkok! Regards from Kanjana, former thai citizen that now lives in Sweden Clean  nice coffee.

The staff is super friendly. Especially the security staff. One of them helped us with their umbrella during the rain. Friendly and helpful staff.

Our family room was spacious, but would need some care and attention.

The pool is nice to cool off, it did leave some stains on the clothing and skins in some areas. Layout of the pool could be better.

Breakfast was good, enough choices.

Overall a good experience. We were so happy to spend our first week in Thailand on our honeymoon here. The staff was so friendly and the room was very spacious and clean. They gave us a beautiful welcome to start our honeymoon. Right next to hotel is great pad Thai street food, a 711, a nice Hippo Thai Tea Place, and a very clean laundry facility next door. Would stay again. Thank you! Worst hotel in Bangkok. Stay anywhere, but here. Even a hostel has got more hospitality. The receptionist is rude and unhelpful. I tried to talk to them but they dont want to understand or help. The rooms had no closets or drawers so its not conventional for long stays. Paid extra for balcony and smoking yet was falsely advertised and not provided. The bidet in the toilet had to be the worst experience by far. The hotel phone was not working, and no button lead to reception. Breakfast menu was mediocre at best with limited options and tasteless. Bed sheets were stained.Nicely decorated lobby to make up for the slow elevators and subpar rooms. Mediocre breakfast who treats paying guests as criminals for wearing hotel slippers. Communication skill is at zero from all star. Dangerous streets, at night my two daughters had an experience of a car following them at night until they started running.

Rooms were next to a school and had loud, annoying and noisy announcements in the morning hours. You cant even sleep in because the school music is loud. Breakfast was not even worth waking up for.

The security was shouting and following my son while using intimidation tactics all due to wearing hotel slippers. He did not hear the first staff telling him about the slippers when all of a sudden a security guard started shouting out of the blue. No matter what he did, shouting and treating guests like this is simply unacceptable. I usually dont bother to write reviews even when its been a bad stay but this time was actually unbelievable and a total waste of my money. 711 was next door, amazing hotel, great service, all staff were so lovely and welcoming. Rooms were very clean was were HUGE you cant see it in the pics but it was big. Good location, only annoying thing was most times I ordered a bolt they would wait across the road and youd have to cross which isnt fun in Bangkok so make sure you  tell the member of staff who I think was security that they are your taxi and hell go to them and make them pull up in the hotels drive 1010 would come back, incredibly cheap for what it was I would have expected to pay more","Monday: Open 24 hours

W1@Bangkoknoi,"44, Tambon Bang Len, Amphoe Bang Yai, Chang Wat Nonthaburi 11140, Thailand",4.6,13.8375266,100.426804,"Had a lovely stay in the Pool Suite of W1Bangkoknoi. It's quite a long drive in from the main road but once you arrive, you are suddenly transported into tranquility.

The staff will drive you on a buggy from the car park to the lobby even though it is only a few steps away. Throughout our stay from checking in, to breakfast and checking out, we were met with friendly smiles from the amazing staff.

The Pool Suite was amazing. My only firstworld gripes would be that toilet was a bit tiny the big float in the public pool which is right next no privacy to the private pool in the suite and it would have been perfect if there was a sofa instead of two chairs for the living room.

There are many free activities that you can join, but I only did the morning alms for the monk who would come by on a boat in the early morning.

Overall, excellent stay just a short drive from Bangkok. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotelresort.
The staff is extremely friendly
the food is incredibly delicious.
After a long flight we completely recovered to travel on to our next destination.
If you don't feel like being in the rush of busy Bangkok then this place is definitely recommended.
We will definitely come back if only to see all those lovely people again. Super fresh and nice staff.
Nice area, with peace and quiet.
Far from normal tourist areas, with good local food and people nearby
Will use this hotel again for sure. Nestled along the picturesque Bangkok Noi Canal, W1Bangkoknoi is a hidden gem that seamlessly combines a gardenlike setting with an exquisite culinary experience. My recent visit to this captivating restaurant left me thoroughly impressed.

Upon entering the serene atmosphere, the appeal of the canalside location becomes immediately apparent. The restaurant's strategic design offers panoramic views of the tranquil water, creating an idyllic backdrop that sets the stage for an unforgettable dining experience. The lush greenery surrounding the venue only adds to the charm, making W1Bangkoknoi an ideal choice for those seeking a sophisticated and intimate setting.

Opting for the Grill Buffet, we indulged in the freshest catches of the day  succulent fish and plump river prawns that left our taste buds delighted. The selection at the grill station was nothing short of impressive, showcasing a commitment to quality and freshness that truly set W1Bangkoknoi apart. Every bite of the perfectly grilled seafood was a testament to the chef's skill and dedication to delivering a toptier dining experience.

To elevate our meal, we decided to pair our grill delights with an Italian red wine recommended by the knowledgeable staff. The wine selection complemented the flavors impeccably, enhancing the overall dining experience. The staff's attention to detail and commitment to ensuring a seamless meal only added to the exceptional service we received throughout the evening.

W1Bangkoknoi is a culinary oasis that beckons those in search of a dining experience that transcends the ordinary. Whether you're a seafood enthusiast, a wine connoisseur, or someone simply craving a sophisticated evening by the water, W1Bangkoknoi is the destination that promises to fulfill. Very brave hotel investor. Hard to get to but once you arrive the 29 room hotel, nice cafe and pool will make it worthwhile visit. Staff are all friendly providing good service.

If I was younger I may not have minded staying here but the location was not what we really wanted, off an alley off a side street. It would be a walk to a main road to find anything. The staff was very nice but the amenities were lacking such as no hair dryer or counter space. The bed and pillows were comfortable, but the sitting room and kitchenette were not to my liking, unless I was 40 years younger. I would not recommend their restaurant or using the spa. Pool seemed acceptable. We ended up leaving after the first night and booked elsewhere. My younger traveling self would not have minded it. I cannot say enough about the outstanding service at this hotel. The staff truly go above and beyond to ensure your stay is exceptional. Being from the USA, I have never experienced customer service of this caliber. I was staying overnight on my birthday, and to my surprise, the front desk noticed the occasion. Later, four employees, along with two managers, came to my door with a birthday cake, sang Happy Birthday, and even had me blow out a candle. I was absolutely blown away by the level of thoughtfulness and care. Ive never experienced anything like it as a guest, and it made my stay unforgettable Cons
1. WiFi is atrocious, almost unusable. Maybe it's just some rooms but we can hardly load videos.
2. Upon arrival we found the Airconditioning filters were fully blocked with dust dead human skin and whatever else extremely disgusting. How they don't have a schedule to clean them is ridiculous and unacceptable.
3. The speaker on the TV was blown. The technician came and replaced it with another TV which also had a blown speaker  so he went and got another TV.
4. The gym doesn't have any cleaning products for guests to wipe down the equipment afterwards. Who knows how much sweat is stained into the equipment, even just after half a day!
5. Lighting in the bathroom is unnecessarily dim.
6. One of the sealed windows leaks when it rains and creates a small puddle in the room.
7. Area isn't th greatest but no real biggy.

Pros the staff were very nice and easy to deal with. Beds are comfy and clean. The pool is a great length for doing laps if no one else is there.

Hotel could be so much better with a slight management restructure that actually checks up on issues guests are having.

Wouldn't personally recommend staying as it seems there are alot of corners cut. My wife and I spent a night in this hotel when we arrived in Bangkok and we loved it !
Located in a non touristic and really calm neighborhood, you will find there  a lot of kindness from the people working at Isanook, big brigh and very clean rooms, a great combo swimming pool  jacuzzi  gym and a very cozy cafe !
One of the best hotel we had the chance to spend a night in, thank you for this experience  Best experience you can have at this hotel! We stayed 3 weeks here and we enjoyed every night and day. super clean rooms personnel were very attentive and Mr. Yod manager always very helpful. definitely would be back here. also the restaurant on the 6th floor and if you eat outside you have great views any time",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The hostel is clean, comfortable and affordable. The stuffs are friendly, the sky train station is near as well for going around the city. So it is very convenient staying at this hostel. Very much recommend. I would definitely stay here again. True to its name, this hostel looks hidden and not easily visible. The roads are congested, so if you're planning to park a 4 wheeler, it's going to be tough. But there is a metro station in walkable distance. Other than that, the staff, the room for the price they offer is a W. It's clean and well organised. Definitely would want to stay here againwe were a group of 4 friends My friends and I got a room with 10 beds for the 7 of us and we got the room for 258SGD for 4 nights which I think is great value. The extra beds gave us some extra space for our stuff. You can rent a towel for 30THB if you forget to bring one. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Breakfast is offered for free and is pretty basic bread, water, milk and different spreads for the bread, hot water and instant noodles too for a small price.

A bit disappointed in the bathrooms, they were not bad, but some locks and shower handle were bloody broken. Bathroom is shared between guests if you dont have a private room.

The hostel is located not far away from a 711 and some good restaurants. It's at walking distance from On Nut BTS and a Tesco Lotus too which has a lot of food stalls too.

The hotel is truly hidden as our grab driver had trouble finding it, it might be tough for vehicules to get here, I would recommend getting off at the street nearby. Nice clean hostel with friendly staffs.
Simple but good breakfast included, bathrooms are relatively clean and tidy and you can tell it is well maintained.
Not far from BTS On Nut station at a walking distance, motorbikes cost you only 15 Baht.
I don't want to recommend this hostel because it may make me very hard to book for the next time visit.  Service is great, people are nice. The location is great as it is near the Sky Train, and other cool spots by Sukhumvit, however, our sleep was always interrupted because it was so noisy outside by the road and you can hear everyone by the hallways.","Monday: Open 24 hours

All the teams take great care of the customer. I congratulate and thank this exceptional team. I will come back to see you!!  The room was clean, the atmosphere welcoming, and the location was perfectclose to the airport and easy access to the city.

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, especially Rizky the Assistant Manager and his team, who provided invaluable information and assistance that made my vacation much easier.

I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for comfort and convenience. Ill definitely be back! Good value for money. The rooms are fine. Nice bathroom and good bed. Balcony also available. The public downstairs area with pool is really nice. Evening meals are great. Selection of breakfast food for European is not great. Would be nice to see how the hotel is, when there is no building site opposite to it Location is still great  only 3 stations from the airport. Good hideout!! Really nice room, very comfortable bed. The location is perfect, very close to the Airport Link so easy to get into central Bangkok, or the airport. The room had a lovely balcony and the location is really quiet. The staff are exceptionally friendly and very helpful. They have a small electric buggy and are happy to carry you to and from the Airport Link rail station even though it's in easy walking distance. I stayed at the Silver Palm Wellness Resort from the 17.10. untill the 26.10.2024 with a friend of mine that is still there for another few weeks ,I guess. And I was very satisfied with all the amenities in the hotel. A special compliment to all the staff. They were all very friendly and helpfull. One very special compliment to the Asst. Front Office Manager Mr. Ritzki Daniar for his friendlyness , support and hospitality . I myself used to work in the Hotel business myself as well for many years. And i can say I would imediatly stay at the Silver Palm Wellness Resort any time again , should I visit Bangkok in near future again.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The pool looked good but we didnt try it  it is however located at bottom floor, same as the entrance.

Also! Theres a free shuttle going to 711 or beginning of the street! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is prefect for quiet stay away from the busy city center. There's ample parking and very suitable for our Thailand road trip adventure. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfy. Great hotel in Bangna area of Bangkok. Comfortable bed and room with all the amenities. Quiet at night with a good sleep. Everyone on staff we came into contact with was very pleasant and helpful. Good hotel, friendly staff, clean rooms. Pool is clean with salt water, there is an outside shower.

The only downside is the Internet, you need to enter the password every time on all devices.

The staff at the 24hour front desk were exceptionally friendly and helpful, always ready to assist with anything we needed. The location is perfect for exploring the city, and our room was spacious, spotless, and allowed us to bring in outside food and drinkssuper convenient.

A special shoutout to Ms. Mint, who went above and beyond when our flight was delayed. We had to stay in the lounge for two hours, and although we couldnt extend our stay, she made sure we were comfortable and even prepared our lunch when we ordered it.

Overall, the experience exceeded our expectations, and we highly recommend Phra Nakhon Poshtel for a comfortable and welcoming stay in Bangkok! I stayed for one night with my family. The room is spacious compared to the hostelhotel around this areamodern design and clean. I enjoy staying at this hotel.
The staff were very kind and helpful. Thank you for your service!
The hotel is conveniently located near many attractions in the heart of Bangkok, within walking distance of most places. Really modern, nice rooms. The staff is extremely friendly and professional  they gave us a lot of recommendations and asked us even how our day was or what we did that specific day. They give complimentary water every day with the private room, which was a nice addition. Also, we could leave our backpacks after checkout for a few hours at the reception, which is always a nice plus. The room could have been a bit bigger, but overall great experience! Something to note is that the walls are quite thin, so if you have people next to you that are loud at night, that could be a problem. Room was a bit small, but the price was right. Located adjacent to many nice places and very walkable area during the day, the immediate couple blocks around it are a little bit sketch though and I wouldn't recommend being out after dark. Staff were great, definitely the highlight of the stay. I would stay here again. Photos are not always reliable on websites.   Since I was in the neighborhood, I wanted to check out the rooms for myself before booking.  I was refused because the hotel's policy is ""not to show the rooms"" .  I found it very strange, this is the first time that I have been refused to show you the rooms.  I finally understood the reason the rooms are very small and what the photos are trying to hide so I did well not to book.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

I would say I expected cleaner bed and towels, those should definitely be washed cleaner next time. Service and facilities, however, were top notch. Cannot complain about the location. Overall just a great experience! If I could give more than five stars, I would. The service here is truly incredible and the staff are so polite, accommodating, friendly and helpful. Good service started the moment we walked in they took our luggage and brought us tea and cold towels. They even took our luggage to our room for us! Our room is clean, spacious, and bright. It has a great shower and even a jacuzzi tub. The pool area is also fantastic and has a swim up bar to order food and drinks. The location of this hotel is perfect and so many things are well within walking distance. Its also close to Khao San Rd but far enough away that you dont hear all the noise. On our next trip to Bangkok we will absolutely be staying at this hotel again. Thank you for such amazing service and such a wonderful experience! Very nice property, short walk to Khao San and within reasonable walking distance of the Palace. Staff friendly and attentive. Rooms clean and quiet. Bed large and medium firmness. Tea, water, slippers, and bathrobes all provided. Rooftop pool offers a lovely view and ample umbrellas for shade, though gets crowded in midday.
Was initially assigned a room on the second floor, the air conditioning unit suffered what can only be described as a catastrophic failure, emitting fumes and smoke. Quickly assigned a new room on the sixth floor, though a five minute delay in having a staff member come investigate what could very well have been a fire having been told such over the house phone was unsettling. After the fact staff were apologetic and handled as well as could be expected. Presumably an isolated incident. Truly an oasis of calm in a madding sea. We stayed at the Chillax over the Songkron holidays, when pretty much all of Bangkok spills into the streets for a citywide water fight. It was fascinating to witness, but overwhelming to Western sensibilities. Being able to duck back into the hotel and go up to the very pleasant rooftop pool to cool off and watch the festivities from a safe distance was tremendously appealing.

The location is excellent, just far enough removed from the Khaosan Road scene to provide a little bit of peace, but close enough for all of the tourist oriented services. There were a number of decent restaurants on the road and back the alley into the Rambutri village area.

The service was uniformly kind and polite to a fault, the room was generally very comfortable with excellent AC. The only real issue was the odd configuration of the shower, which made splashing water onto the floor inevitable.

Bangkok in general is anything but a pedestrian friendly city, but it is always easy to flag a cab or use the Grab app to pick up a ride from here.

We would definitely stay here again if we ever come back to Bangkok. It is a pleasant place to be. I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of my Thailand. It liked that it was close to Khao San Road but not too close that it would be loud at night. It was convenient to many restaurants and stores. The room was clean but a bit dated. The rooftop pool was large and nice. I would stay here again.","Monday: Open 24 hours

She's eloquent in her English, able to communicate well, passionate about her career  will go the extra mile to explain specific details about your room to you  very much like what a concierge will do. She also takes in feedback readily  in a positive manner. She's a gem to the business. Keep it up! In Bangkok for 2 days, we found this hotel with its amazing location.
The place did not disappoint the staff is very attentive to details.
The room is very cozy and the breakfast in the building across the hotel is actually amazing.
A special thank you to the whole team and especially to Kwan and Nu for taking care of us.

Will definitely recommend  My stay at K Maison was a delight! The staff went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and convenience. Despite a language barrier with the taxi driver, they patiently helped me communicate and get picked up at the hotel.

The location was fantastic  close to the downtown area and public transportation, making it easy to explore the city. My room itself was spacious and impeccably clean, providing a relaxing haven after a day of sightseeing.

But the true highlight was the breakfast. Each morning, I was treated to a delicious and varied spread, exceeding my expectations. The quality of the food and the attentive service truly made it a highlight of my stay. We really enjoyed our stay at the K Maison. The staff was so friendly and went above and beyond to accommodate us. They always helped us get taxis, made sure we had everything we needed, etc. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Overall it was a great place to stay. It's been awhile since I came to Bangkok! I managed to book K Maison for my trip.

The location is great, about 10 mins walk to the train station that comes directly from the airport. 711 and supermarket are 1 min walk from the hotel. It's inside of a busy street surrounded by a drinking and eating place.

Even though the hotel is located in an alley, it feels safe.

The room is normal size but it has everything. From place to put luggage till desk and even hanger to hang your clothes. The AC works well especially for a hot place like Bangkok. The toilet and shower works perfectly.

The staffs are very polite and well conversed in English. They listen and will attend to all your needs.

And regards to the comment about the liftelevator, it's working well. No issue.

I will highly recommend it as the hotel fits well with the pricing!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

What stood out to me was the DJ who plays very relaxing music during the day and energetic beats in the evening.
It was a pleasant surprise that upon checkin, they give you a ticket to King Power Mahanakhon t and a voucher for a cocktail at the bar.
If your night was fine , you can find alcohol cocktails on the breakfast menu. I would like to share my stay at The Standard.  I stayed at the hotel for one night with my family and my dog.  I was very happy to be able to take the dog with me.  I really liked the location and atmosphere of the hotel, from the entrance to the observation deck in the tower.
As soon as I checked in, my things were delivered to my room and they brought me bowls and a bed for my dog, which was very nice.  I was given many coupons for the bar in the hotel itself and on the observation deck, as well as a ticket to the site itself, meaning I didnt have to buy it additionally.  The view from the room was gorgeous, I was able to fully enjoy the views of Bangkok and so was my dog.  In the evening I visited the hotel bar and the cocktails were super, I had never drunk anything like that before.  The night views were magnificent.  It was nice to have a 24hour gym, if not for the bar, I would definitely have worked out, as there were good exercise equipment there.  The pool and jacuzzi overlooking the tower were great.  And most importantly, I would like to mention the two wonderful girls at the reception, Cisa and Cartoon, thanks to whom my stay at The Standard was so wonderful and gave me a lot of emotions.  They told me everything, showed me everything, surrounded me with care, its very nice.  I really hope that the girls will receive encouragement from management.  Thank you for the warm welcome, I will definitely return to your hotel. More like Above Standard!

The hotel exceeded our expectations as the front officeconcierge services were exceptional thanks to Tinas team!

The freshly baked pastries also were a big highlight, would even say the best I have had, even compared to some of the finest French hotels in Paris!!!

Thank you again Tina and team! Will def come back.
J  T Years ago, we stayed at the New York branch, and today, we find ourselves at the Bangkok location. This hotel undoubtedly ranks among the top ten we have ever stayed in. Its vibrant colours and stylish design immediately exude a modern and energetic atmosphere. One of the most impressive aspects is the rooms air conditioning, which is as quiet and comfortable as that of the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok, ensuring a peaceful and restful environment. The room itself has been thoughtfully designed, with wheelchair accessibility in mind, featuring spacious doorways and wellplaced handrails, showcasing the hotels attention to detail and inclusivity.

The swimming pool and gym facilities are equally outstanding. The gyms scale and equipment are worldclass, and our family had a wonderful time here, creating lasting memories.

However, there were a few drawbacks. Firstly, the restaurants food was fairly average, and the Thai noodle soup I had for breakfast was, unfortunately, the worst Ive ever tasted. Secondly, despite the hotel being located in one of Bangkoks tallest buildings, our room was on a lower floor, which meant the view was less impressive than anticipated. Lastly, there was a management issue when another guests pool expenses were mistakenly added to our room bill, highlighting some flaws in their billing system.

Here are my personal ratings, with a maximum score of 5 points

 Room space design 55
 Room functionality planning 35

 Room soundproofing 55
 Air conditioning noise level 55
 Comfort of mattress, pillows, and duvet 55
 Door closing noise 55 The Standard Hotel Bangkok is anything but standard. From the tropical vibes in the foyer when you first enter to the bright colours and collection of eclectic pieces displayed throughout the lobby, this hotel is by far the most incredible hotel in Thailand. The Standard is luxurious but not stuffy!

My husband and I spent our honeymoon with The Standard and were so impressed by the details, care and consideration that goes into everything they do. With guests at the top of the priority list, we were treated like gold by every single staff member everyday. The service is outstanding in every bar, restaurant, pool, gym and service area in the building.

We were provided special treats like cakes and cocktails on various occasions to congratulate us on our honeymoon, which was a special touch that did not go unnoticed.

Special mention to the guests experience team who provided us with their WhatsApp details to keep in touch, they were always happy to point us in the right direction for recommendations on food, bars, activities, hotspots and even tattoo artists. Ricky from the guest experience team was so so helpful and ensure our honeymoon was absolute perfection!

The hotel has diverse staff throughout and welcome a range of different guests, this proves their commitment to providing  tailored hospitality with a non judgemental approach.

Highly recommend  and we will definitely be back the next time we are in Bangkok.

Thank you",no operation time,"lodging, gym, bar, restaurant, food, health, point_of_interest, establishment"

The hosts owners were lovely and very helpful, and there is delicious food and coffee to order! The location is right by the BTS, making it easy to get around, and theres a lot nearby as well. I recently stayed at this hostel with 3 friends for 6 nights in a 4bed dorm during a fitness event in Bangkok. The ownermanager was exceptionally friendly and always available to assist with our queries. The hostel was clean, quiet, and felt like our home away from home in the bustling city. We loved having access to the communal kitchen and living space, the efficient air conditioning in the room, fast and reliable WiFi, and the convenience of 247 access. I'll definitely return for its affordable and convenient accommodations. 55 stars! Ive been to Thailand many times but this time I chose to stay at Local Time Bangkok Hostel given the close proximity to the BTS station and they have a family room as well.

The place is well cleaned and very quiet with many kids activities around like the Thailand Education Science centre about 1 BTS stop, and the safari zoo 25mins car ride.

If you are into bars and beer garden, there are more than a dozen under 200m radius walk. If you are not picky about the environment, they have a local Thai food shop that is about 300m walk down the alley they serve cheap authentic Thai food 7 dishes  coconut drink cost around 500bhat. Their tom yum soup is quite good and its on par with the restaurant grade. The 711 store is also around that area as well. There is a meat hot plate BBQ place there as well but we didnt try it as our stomach is always full of nice local Thai food.

My wife loves to shop Big C and they have a Big one that is about 10min car ride btw the grab rides something like uber are pretty chea, we practically use it for our whole trip

Just before I left, I got a chance to meet with the host. We took a photo together and say goodbye. This hostel is a family run business so if you happen to chance upon to see this review, give this place a try! The staff was amazing, very helpful, efficient and nice. The rooms were comfortable and the bathrooms and kitchen were always clean and tidy. The hosts were sooo sweet, location was good super close to train station that took me everywhere. Would recommend!","Monday: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Terminal 21, BTS, MRT isn't too far away, street food stalls are all just outside the hotel, along with fancier, pricier eateries if that's what you want. There's even a laundry shop nearby! Last but not least, tons of massage parlours for you to choose.

The room itself served its purpose. Bed was alright, but the showers was either too hot, or not hot enough. And the angle of the showerhead can make the toilet wet. The streets can get somewhat noisy at night.

Staff was attentive although they don't replenish your toothpaste. Upon arrival was upgraded from a deluxe to an executive room which was excellent.

Good
 Bathtub in bathroom.
 Friendly reception.
 Large fridge, microwave and sink.
 Located next to Terminal 21 Asok.
 Modern, clean and spacious room.
 Sofa, multiple chairs, dressing table and small dining table.

Bad
 Lukewarm water in the bathtub.

Located around the corner from Terminal 21 Asok, this hotel is hard to beat in the AsokNana area. I stayed this hotel bout 6days, the location excellent, walking distance around 35minutes can reach BTS  MRT station.

And the staff very helpful n kind, I realized that I forget my phone after I check in at airport,  so they tried to help me send the parcel to me. Really appreciate it. Give a lots of help.

Will visit again when I return back to Bangkok
Great location ,great staff, great hotel. Room has a very weird stench the whole time, very dated furniture and floor is dirty.
Bed is squeaky and soft, and the quilt is extremely thin.
Shower head looks very old and dirty too. The is my 2nd time staying in this hotel.  Is value for dollars, room is big and clean.  Bathtub and smoking room is available.  Location is good near T21, BTS and MRT.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The room is welldesigned, i love how the bedroom is connected to the bathroom by large sliding doors. The mattress and pillows are very comfortable. Also, the bathroom and shower area are clean and spacious. The most important thing is the hospitality of the staffs. Highly recommended! Beautiful hotel with great facilities. The room is of a high standard, pool area is ideal to relax and cool off from the busy city experience and the staff are friendly and efficient. Delicious coffee in restaurant too. The service has been great. The staff is very friendly and polite. The room is clean. There's a pool and a gym. The hotel is quite and clean. Overall, we are very pleased with the quality.

I had some issues finding it too with my Grab driver but some how locals there would help you when you ask them. The hotel is clean and i did not find any issues with anything at all but only for the Wifi connections seems to be weak at room 32. Apart from that, if you are looking for a quiet stay than look no more. I truly enjoyed my stay here and i will be back again soon. This is a nice place and I really can recommend it. It's a beautiful house. The rooms have balconies. I liked that very much. Staff is very friendly. The rooms are a little older than they look at the pictures.But this is really the only not so good thing, I could say. Great location, reasonably priced, comfortable rooms, a bit small, but pleasant. Be aware that the AC leaks, so place luggage or electronics elsewhere. Mini fridge and two courtesy bottles of water. Quiet street yet within walking distance to restaurants, massage parlors, shopping malls, convenience stores, pharmacies, pubs, and the Asok BTS and MRT. The place is starting to age but is still a decent place to stay. Unfortunately the neighbors have a rooster  YES a rooster, in the middle of Bangkok! So if you want to sleep or work the rooster will keep you entertained from 03002300. Bring earplugs. This is a small...very outta the way boutique hotel.

The metro is roughly 500m away and you can just get it anytime.

Theres a big c right opposite the hotel and a 711 too. The best part is theres a lot of food shops in close proximity. The rooms are a little tiny and sometimes you need to check if the rooms have shared bathrooms.

One of the best looks and designs too for an hotel is present. PROS
 Affordable private room with private bathroom. Nice common areas and cafe to hang out.
 Right outside the hotel are plenty of street food, cafes, places to eat, 711, Mini C which accepts cards without min spend unlike 711.
 There is a lift in case you have luggage.
 Area is across street from University and high school so many affordable places to eat and hang out. Caf had reasonable coffee prices. There's also an aircon caf at end of block that had 30 or 35baht cappuccino which was pretty decent. Can also recommend Big Bear and Little Cat Caf a few doors down. But be aware around 4pm, many loud kids at the cafes!
 About 10 min walk from BTS station. If you don't want to walk, you can take a motorbike taxi for 20 baht.

CONS
 Prisonthemed room didn't have a table or chair so not suitable if you want to work inside your room better the common area.
 The toilet didn't have a bidet, perhaps previous guests got the beds and furniture wet?
 No eating and drinking allowed in common areas. You can eat at the Mini C across the street which has chairs and tables. Also outside the caf is a spot generally where smokers hangout. Nice fresh fruit lady there as well! A little historical hotel with old style elevator. Cute! Value for money shared bathroom with adjoining room. 10mins walk from Saphan Taksin BTS. This quirky place has an industrial and modern style that sets it apart from your average hotel. This place really has character! Rooms are clean and feel updated. Staff is very nice and helpful. Small caf on the ground floor with laundry facilities on the top floor. Walking distance to the river as well as the sky train, and other lively parts of Bangkok. Even with great local access, this place is situated on a quieter side street with street vendors right outside when you're ready for a meal. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone whose looking to stay in Bangkok. Brilliant hotel. Comfiest bed and AC I have experienced while travelling round Asia. Brilliant decor and styling and great sound isolation.

Every morning we had coffee which was delicious and very well made. Very cheap prices as well.

Street food vendors, Seven Eleven right outside the door so perfect for any situation or event.

Staff very friendly and accommodating. Location is good and you can grab very cheap bolt bikes or a taxi in the evening. 10 min walk from the river boat as well.

Overall I highly recommend this hotel.

Will be coming back here if I ever return to Thailand.

The pool was lifesaving as there were almost 48C during our visit! The atmosphere is quiete and relaxed, great drinks from the bar. Excellent location central in the backpackers Banglamphu district, but not with the noise there is at Thanon Khao San. No subway or Skytrain, so use Grab to move around. Nice wooden hotel with much green. Rooms not really big, missed some spot to hang my towels. Good breakfast, very friendly staff. The hotel has a restaurant, but next door there is a brilliant crowded outdoor restaurant called The Family closed Tuesday and Wednesday. Arrived and found location, though taxi easily. Rooms cool and refreshing drink offered on arrival. Pool support great after long day. No swimming after 8pm wasn't so nice. Clean rooms and comfy beds after long walks and outings. A 7.11 is close and the famous Khaosun road. Plus atms. Great location very friendly staff. The rooms are clean and tidy. The food was great. The service was great recommend.

No fault of the best western, but you can get better for the same money in that area. Breakfast is in a side by resturant from a fixed menu.

Rooms are ok.
Location is good, very near to market and places, parks

Checkin available literly after 2pm The room was clean and comfortable. We heard water dripping from AC during the night so we informed the receptionist and the maintenance guy came to checked right away. Very impressed There can only be parking for 23 cars, which means if you drive, you may not have a place to park. Receptionist has communication problem. She avoided saying that there is a chance that we cant park at the hotel when we arrive  and did not communicate directly. We wasted time to understand what she explained for long.

For those visiting the hotel for the first time. The hotel is located in the mall on the second floor. The place is clean and so are the rooms. Just from my experience the towels and other things had a dusty, mold type smell. I can understand as the room I booked is a smoking room. So I can understand why it would have that certain odor. super convenient to everywhere. Only 1 min to Nana station as well as boot, Macdonald, 5 mins to T21 mall.  Room is clean and tidy. Highly recommended. Nice location. Appalling staff. Especially man in reception.  I ve been there several times this man always grumpy and unwelcoming . Otherwise good rooms .but staff has room for improvement if they still want  our service The rooms were nice, but a little small. I really loved that they had 4 pillows in the room. The breakfast offers eggs to order and they can cook eggs very well. Great hotel.  Be aware, you must use your room key to use the elevator.  You can only go up to your floor. Going down, you don't need to use your room key. More pragmatic than elegant, this brilliant hotel is all about location, location, location. Though they don't have a restaurant, there is an allnight diner in the building and dozens of great food joints in walking distance so I was never left wanting.
The diner will give you a Continental breakfast  American or English, or any of a myriad AND unpronounceable Thai dishes while you wait. I tried both genres and came away happy.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The rooms are very cheap for a reason. They suck. The room and floor smells. My guess app the bird poo. Beds are not great. The pool is tiny and dirty. It looks like they haven't cleaned it for a month. The entry is dumb has stairs while your wheeling your luggage in. Just make it a ramp. Our window is covered is bird poo so is our entire view out our window. Which is unsanitary and dangerous as that carries diseases.
The walls are falling apart even. Big cracks through the concrete.

Also bugs crawling around in the room. Lovely... Overall this hotel could have much better service. The location was good and the rooms were ok value for the money, however walls and doors are very thin and you can hear every noise during the night. Also the staff was just not friendly. Wouldn't say hi or even make eye contact. Could not be bothered to help me figure out public transit to the airport. Also DO NOT pay for the included breakfast. It's 6 which is a lot by Thai standards, and it's basically just 2 eggs and a piece of toast. They won't even give a second cup of coffee. Save the 6 and just go to any restaurant in the area. Fantastic hotel stay! The rooms were clean, comfortable, and wellequipped. The staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive, ensuring a pleasant experience. The location was convenient, and the amenities were topnotch. Highly recommend for a relaxing and enjoyable stay! Our room here was excellent for the price. Fantastic budget option if you want to be really close 2 min walk to Khao San Road, but also want to be able to sleep at night! The room was clean and theres a nice pool area downstairs with a pool table and drinks available. The staff were friendly and the room was clean. Our room had armchairs for seating, a television, a mini fridge and a kettle which was great. An endless amount of restaurants, bars, and shopping in the area around this place and the restaurant at the ground floor of this building does good food and lets you cut through to get from the hotel to Khao San even quicker The rooms are a big contrast to what the lobby is, allready the 3rd hotel in similar price range, but this one doesnt meet its standars!!

The vibe here is just greatcomfy, modern, and super clean! The best part? It's close to 7Eleven and all the snack spots, plus the skytrain is nearby. My first time in Bangkok, and I already got a spot thats totally recommended! I stayed here during after getting a hair transplant at the nearby Absolute Clinic 15 min walk. The rooms were clean and well stocked I had a fridge, balcony with sink, and a couch. It was more like an apartment room. Laundry was very easy and cheap. Breakfast every morning was the highlight Handcrafted coffee drinks with a variety of breakfast options, in a nice cafe setting. Plenty of food and convenience store options nearby. Quiet area and only 10 minute walk to Krong Thon Buri BTS station. Staff very helpful, friendly and respectful. Would absolutely stay again. This hotel exceeded my expectations in so everything.

Let's start with the core and soul of this establishment ITS STAFF 
If you read this review, I want each of you yo know you're doing an excellent job. Joyfully helpful, provide clear and accurate information. Second, the hotel itself. It is very well maintained and efficiently designed. You can tell it required an architect Bravo. Minimalist and stylish.
It is my first visit to Thailand. So, it is also important for me to stay in an authentic neighborhood, close to transit infrastructures. It did exactly this. I walked to everything even when the train or bus were available.
I will come back, for sure! Affordable price and close to BTS Krungthonburi which you can take the BTS golden line to Icon Siam, the room is fairly small but its worth for paying compared to any other hotels in the same area. If youre looking for a hotel thats in the heart of the city, then this is not for you. You might find the 1520 minute taxi ride going downtime too far. If you want to stay at somewhere quiet, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, then this should be okay.
Located in a residential alley, it can really be quiet in the evening. However, there are 3 711 nearby incase you get hungry in the middle of the night.

Stayed here for 4 nights with kids. Checked in at their family room. The room is small, but it did fit us comfortably. The bathroom is really white, we loved the minimalist design and the fact that it doesnt smell, and has good water pressure and a bidet made us happy.

Cant say much about the breakfast since we only had 2, since some days we had to leave really early. The first breakfast we had was on the salty side. The latte though was great.

The staff are also courteous and accommodating of our needs. I left my earbuds there and they are so far helpful in helping me get it back ","Monday: 6:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Prince Theatre Heritage Stay Hostel - Silom,"441/1 Charoenkrung Road, Si Wiang, แขวงสีลม เขตบางรัก กรุงเทพมหานคร 10500, Thailand",4.5,13.7206253,100.5166393,"This hostel has a great location and honestly had really nice rooms! The bed was comfy, and each bed is enclosed for privacy in the dorms. The only issue i had was the bathrooms. I stayed in two different rooms over a week and both had very unclean bathrooms, especially the shower. The walls and curtain had mold all over them and just look like they dont routinely get a thorough clean. Same with the floors. The shower drain in both rooms backed up and sometimes would flow over and get water everywhere. Cleanliness could definitely be improved here. Other things to note theres no communal kitchen, they dont let outside food on the main floor, they dont let you sit in the theatre which is the restaurant unless buying food, which leaves only a couple tables and couches for everyone to use. Basically there isnt a great hangout spot. However for a nights sleep, it was great and the rooms were quiet, beds were comfortable! The location is fantastic. That's probably the only positive. The reception staff are hopeless. During checkin, they requested the passports of all the people checking in. That's fine, so we gave them all the passports. They then gave us an intrusive form to fill out, asking for our home address, where we had been before arriving in Thailand, and where we would be going next. We were still okay with this, even though it seemed completely unnecessary for them to know. What frustrated me was that we also needed to fill in the passport numbers. We left that section blank because we didn't have the passportsthey had taken them to make copies. When they asked why we hadn't filled out that part, I pointed to the passports on the table. It seemed they couldn't fill it out for us. The most frustrating part was when we asked for our passports back. It took a full minute of internal discussion before they returned them. It might seem like a small thing to get upset about, but that's not all.

Its the overall ineptitude of the reception staff in dealing with guests. For example, when I went down to question why there was no housekeeping done on the first day, I found that the room was still not clean at 3 pm. When I went to the reception, they gave the standard excusebusy, no staff, etc. Then they asked if we wanted it cleaned now. We had just returned and hoped to have a quiet rest, so I suggested we schedule a time. They said no, as housekeeping finishes at 6 pm. Well, if they had cleaned it, like most hotels do, before 12 pm, they wouldn't have to deal with a guest asking about it later. The reception staff need to be trained on how to talk to guests, especially the gentleman with the black nail polish. You might not be able to solve a problem immediately, but don't make matters worse by staring back and repeating the same response. It doesnt help and only makes the person you are talking to more upset. Great place, rooms have storage space for bags and a included towel. Movies most weeknights with popcorn 20baht. Movies seem very random and probably something you've never seen before. Close to the train, great atmosphere. Food options after kitchen is closed are good, I'd gotten the chicken bites and sweet potato fries.

Breakfast option seems kinda steep for what it is buffet eggs, toast, cereal, fruit on a small table for 200bahtperson. Keycard stopped working on second day of 2 night stay. Not sure why, but was able to get fixed quickly with reception still open. The stay was nice overall. Huge theatre screen is a major feature. The bed was in own designated room providing more safety but this also means there is only one stall for toilet and showers for 6 or 8 people.Lucky to have less occupants in September. The curtain needs to be cleaned or replaced. The water may spill out to other area of washroom. The water pressure goes down if the tap is open for long in the cleaning jet at toilet.More cleaning attention is needed .Maintenance needs more attention... had a little leaking water in shower.
The bed partitions are made of plastic sheet which is not 100 opaque.It is nice that upper section beds are not via steep ladder. Great location for connections to the BTS and river boats.
The staff were helpful and friendly with great English.
The theme of the hotel is so cool and unique.
The superior dorms were good. Beds comfy and clean. The dividers between beds don't block out any light which is challenging at times.
The place isn't very social so if you're looking to meet backpackers probably not great. But for digital nomads it seemed good. Lots of working areas.",no operation time,"cafe, lodging, bar, food, point_of_interest, establishment"

The bed is a little bit hard, but is tolerable. The fitness center is nice. The outdoor pools are quite small, which are suitable for kids. Breakfast served at the first floor is great, including some traditional Thai foods and a variety of choices. I like homemade ice cream a lot. The main build of the hotel is not quite easy to access via public transport. The hotel had ferry taking guests to the mall across the river, 6 times daily. Fantastic hotel!

Comfortable rooms. Amazing shower and bathroom!

The breakfast  so much choice. Literally anything you could wish for!

Mostly the wonderful staff here need a mention. So warm, kind, friendly and cannot do enough for you!!

Travelled for my friend's birthday and they went the extra mile! Fantastic hotel with plenty nearby IF you want to leave the hotel!
I say IF as the hotel is perfect so you may not even want to leave! 2 night here and with an incredible view of the river and fantastic facilities we will be back for sure!
Service from the moment we arrived until we left was immaculate and the hotel itself has so many spaces to chill and explore we were very happy. Our personal favourite was sitting beside the pool on the sun beds looking at the river watching to boats fly by! Very happy customers Best location, best friendliness.
Breakfast is delicious.
Staff very diligent and friendly.
River view rooms are recommended.
Pool is not very large, but adequate for the number of guests. The hotel is well maintained and there are many places to take photos. Lovely stay, comfortable a lounge and rooms. The staff are well trained and offer great service. I enjoyed the almost secret lap pool, which was virtually my private oasis during our trip.
Decore a little tired, but priced as such.","Monday: Open 24 hours

First of all, our customers are laying over here and they are booked for rent a van with driver. Of course, we are standby before timing and our customers from another country. We were dealing with them that if we are there, we will be informing our lovely customers by letting hotel staff calling

But yeah, the hotel staff not really nice and ignored when we needed help to connecting with the customers

We are not really happy about it! We are expecting and hoping that the hotel will be considering this situation and improving your reception to be nicely in next time

We hope to see the first impression in this hotel in next time, many thanks! Huge clean rooms with nice view.
Free drinks and snacks also were helpful.

Gave it 3 stars because of 2 points
1. Toilet too old flush takes 3 times to make water clear
2. Shower is fixed and too tight space. Bathtub also has shower but problem is no shower curtains and also other side has windows going to room that makes both sides wet The Hotel is very nice we booked this with my Family , 2 Adults 2 Children , The rooms are very good and huge we booked 1 BR suite , it have separate kitchen with Washing machine , Micro , Fridge Etc . Its near Us Embassy and Very near by Nana Station and Central Plaza Mall and major Shopping Area , with In 10 Mins you can reach main shopping area . The staff is very nice and helpful . Overall experience is very good and yeah breakfast was also good. Pics are attached Thanks I like that the TB has a hightech Japanese toilet. The room is clean and nice, and the balcony is an added nice touch. The lobby is small and usually crowded. The breakfast spread is OK with many options, such as Japanese and Chinese dishes. I like that everything in the mini bar is free. Thai staff are fantastic, Foyer area modern and very nice. Daily breakfast was  continental with the usual trims perfectly acceptable. The room was dated and in need in need  of a refurbishment, comfortable enough.
Sky train is close and the best way to get around in BKK. The room is quite noisy, very busy street below, and there are no double glazed windows or doors.
 Nothing to do with the hotel , but beware of ""FAKE"" policeman out front.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Tori Prestige Bangkok Hotel,"57 34 Soi Phetchaburi 15, Khwaeng Thanon Phaya Thai, Khet Ratchathewi, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10400, Thailand",3.9,13.7554161,100.5385185,"Review for Tori Prestige Hotel, Bangkok
Stayed September 512, 2024

Our group of students and teachers stayed at Tori Prestige Hotel while attending an academic competition in Bangkok. Despite initial concerns based on some negative reviews, we were pleasantly surprised by the experience. While the rooms were small and lacked certain amenities like shower caps and toothbrushes, the cozy setup actually helped our group bond, as the students interacted more closely.

The hotel staff was attentive and accommodating, cleaning the rooms daily and always providing fresh towels. Although the 1000 Baht noise fine initially worried us, we were never penalized, even with lively middle school students. Breakfast offered light, tasty options in a comfortable setting.

Overall, while the hotel is basic, the friendly service and bonding atmosphere made our stay enjoyable. I'd recommend it for groups looking for simple accommodations with great hospitality. The area is within walking distance to a 711, food, and shopping areas. The room is comfortable and cleaned every day, with coffee, water, and toiletries replenished daily. John is of a kind staff very accommodating and welcoming. They are easy to contact and very helpful with anything we needed. also with milyn and mac.  I will definitely recommend this place to my friends. The location is hard to find even drivers got it really difficult to reach. When I arrived they asked for a deposit and ID card which I find totally unreasonable. The ambience is horrible and ridiculously hot inside. I find the staff really difficult to comprehend and impolite as I sit on the lobby and watch them talk with Thai customers as I wait for my door key card and noticed they give just one even if you're in a group. I picked my luggages and nobody else assisted me. The lift is really small and I experienced sharing the lift with their cleaner which I find really inconvenient. When I arrived and opened the room, the smell from the toilet bombarded my nostrils for real. I don't know which cleaning materials they use and it's really strong scent. When I turned on the lights the room is not same as shown online the bedsheets and towels torn and stained, I opened the airconditioning and it's been a long while I didn't felt cold at all. I talked with the front desk and reported about the room condition they said the room attendant and maintenance are unavailable. I stayed for long hours in the room it's completely a bad experience. If you're looking for a place to stay I don't suggest staying here. Its really careless for manage. Bad smell in bath room, Very bad feeling after stay and dirty, very expensive if comparing with quality. Noisy, No choose if have more choice. Its shouldnt be have low quality hotel like this in famous city with high cost. First bad expert feeling. 1. Room is really tight and small. Dont have enough place for you to keep your big luggage. The blankets are dirty and bed sheets have a lot of stains. The fridge is not cold and a lot of ants all over the rooms. The toilet is too small and the shower area has a funny design and too tight, if you are the big side person there will be too uncomfortable for you to move around. The rubbish bin is broken and small as well.
2. There will be 1000 as deposit on the first day which never be mentioned on the app before booking. The service is terrible, they seem very helpful but they dont help at all. Their staffs are not local and the way they treated you is depends on their mood especially the woman with the long hair. On the first day I overheard the local customer is asking the reception woman about the parking, she replied that she did not speak Thai and ignored the customer or trying to help. The next day I have complained about the ants and she said will checked and asked the housekeeper to monitor on it. But their housekeeper service is terrible. They just came in the keep the blanket and changed towers only. No vacuum and no mopping or cleaning anything. The ants still all over the wall which really annoying me. During check out day, I do complained about everything to the reception manhe is not local as well as I look at him like trying to find some excuse to take my deposited. After I done complained then only he gave back me the deposit and ignored me.
3. This hotel location is only convenient if you want to go for shopping because is near to the platinum mall. But its very difficult for you to call a taxi yourself to go somewhere else unless you get the non meter taxi which more expensive than the normal taxi, even if I order from grab its hard to get the taxi as well due the location the too complicated and small road, most of taxi will refuse to accept the order or come in. You may need to walk to the main road to get it, normal day is fine but not will all of your luggages. Others hotel will have buggy car service provided but this hotel have non. Not recommended for family with small kids.
I would say this is my worse experience ever, Im not gonna stay in this hotel again. Whatever you see in the app or pictures, nothing same as it shown. Thank you","Monday: Open 24 hours

The beautiful swimming pool is set in a garden covered with various trees.    There is a playground. There is a slide for children as well. Including activities on Saturday and Sunday from 3 to 4 p.m. The fitness section has a lot of equipment. The stream room and sauna are spacious and comfortable.  There is a restaurant on the lobby level as well. Thank you Khun Bee for welcoming us with a smile and providing friendly service like family friends every time we use the service. We stayed a week in a 1 bed suite. Good value for money and apartment is big and comfortable. Hotel comes with coin laundromat downstairs. Large gym and resortstyle pool.

As hotel has 7 towers, the need to transfer lifts was a tad annoying. Gym is also open to gym members and swimming pool is too small to accommodate number of residents. Pool depth is also 1m very shallow so much better for kids but not possible to do any laps or swim.

Not possible to walk to any sky train so grab taxi is best bet. Close to a few malls so easy access to food and service options. Grab taxi to Siam shopping district takes 3040min depending on traffic.

Coffee club cafe downstairs serves all day meals and open till 2am. I stayed in 1bed suite.

Very good hotel and residence for long term stay. Super family friendly and away from bustle of city center.
Rooms are furnished well, and responsiveness of staff is excellent, truly. All my requests were honored and within time. They have shuttle vans to the nearest points as well.

I stayed here for 4 months for work and would do it again when I get a chance in the future.

The best part of this hotel is the gym for me. Truly kickass and excellent. All compound exercise machines, cardio machines, steam, sauna and super friendly staff. Pool is kickass as well.

Recommend for family, kids and for people who prefer less busy and relaxed vacations. Location is both a hit and miss.
Hit for being less busy which I prefer and miss for the connectivity for BTS. But taxis are plenty and can always use grab or bolt. Gym facilities are amazing. Staff is very helpful and friendly. The play area needs a bit more activity for kids. Maybe a play area for football. The lady in the gymBeeis absolutely lovely and kind. Room was specious
Function room was good.
Services from the staff at Front Desk very nice and helpful.
Meet the Manager Mr. Nutanai , hes so gentle and supportive.
Services from Bell team is perfect
For sure will try to be back again !

Came recommended as a familykid friendly hotel but would not recommend for anyone staying with kids.

The staff were not hospitable and seemed bothered at every point we went to them.

Probably the only good thing for us was the location based on our itinerary. I was arrived at 1130. The reception boy said that my room will be ready at around one. But 1245. I asked him again. He changed to 130. I am very feel bad. Room it ready by if I want to go to room at 1. I have to pay 200 hundreds bhat. Normally for many hotel. If the room ready you can go before two. But here is not. And if check out over 1200 P.M. You have to pay too. Check carefully before you will can to stay here . One the worst experience everyone is robot ther they treat us like a kid wonderfull balcony with bad smell everywere fines notes u can see peoples come to bangkok to relax but ths hotel can make us to remember our strict scl days A good hotel but a lot of inconvenience with many things unpleasant smell, old rooms, hard beds, no access to balcony, no room service until we ask to clean the room, breakfast is very limited options, front desk staff do not speak English. Check in was slow...rooms were not ready
So many fines n rules. Never seen a hotel keeping security deposit. They keep 1000 bhat security deposit per room.
Service was okay
Rooms were also average
Lift was too slow

Grand Mercure Bangkok Atrium,"1880 New Petchaburi Rd, Bangkapi, Khet Huai Khwang, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10310, Thailand",4.3,13.7473073,100.5700755,"Stayed here a few times over the years, it was very clean and the rooms were nice and comfortable in size. The buffet breakfast was really nice but I wish they could extend the hours a bit since Im such a lazy traveller and like to wake late  but thats a gripe I have with every hotel. The location is good but nothing much is within walking distance besides a 7 eleven. All the street food vendors and restaurants are a fair while away. So its good to opt for their breakfast if you dont want to trek first thing. The location was probably the biggest disappointment because it wasn't really nearby anything of interest. So it was either a long walk which was uncomfortable in the climate or taking a carmotorbike which then meant dealing with terrible traffic everywhere.

Aside from that, the included breakfast wasn't very good. They had a lot of variety, but didn't do anything particularly well. Even the coffee machines weren't good  the coffee was lukewarm instead of hot. The room wasn't the same as what is pictured online. Much older and not very nice  dirty walls, cracks on the walls that were repaired badly. There was also a big rise in the transition trim to the bedroom that hurt the feet if it was stepped on wrong. The caulk in the bathroom was dirty and even though it had a nice deep tub that would have been nice for baths, it didn't look very clean and the idea of bath in it made my skin crawl a little.

The cleaning staff were very nice and did as good of a job as they could each day. The front staff were a little frustrating to deal with. I didn't like that they insisted on taking my bags upon arrival despite me telling them not to. Then they didn't bring it right away and I needed my laptop bag to do work that was due ASAP. I waited 45 minutes and then called. I said I was coming down to the front to get the bags myself. When I got down there, they said they sent the bags up to my room already  but then I saw a guy bringing my bags to the elevator. Then he didn't want to hand them over  he wanted to bring them up to my room to set up for me. At this point I said no and got the bags myself. Thankfully I got the bags, but it was much later and more of a headache than it needed to be.

The other thing I was looking forward to was the pool. However, when I got there I found they were doing construction next door and right next to the pool. The mud had a bit of a smell to it so the pool area smelled from the construction and it was loud from the cranesmachines  it just didn't seem like it would be an enjoyable experience so I didn't even go once during my weeklong stay, which was quite disappointing.

Finally, I did some research and saw there were other hotels that were located in better areas and looked like nicer roomslobby areas for the same price. I inquired about checking out early because I was going to switch hotels. First they said they had to ask and couldn't get back to me until the next day. Then the next day they said I could but the refund would take 13 months to process back to my bank account. It just didn't seem worth it so I stuck it out. However, it really wasn't a very enjoyable stay. We are incredibly grateful for the exceptional service provided by this hotel, especially by Tommy the concierge in charge, and Man the restaurant in charge. Their dedication and willingness to go the extra mile made all the difference when we needed help retrieving a camera we accidentally left in a local Grab car. They not only facilitated the communication process but also followed up diligently, ensuring we felt supported every step of the way. Their professionalism and attentiveness truly reflect the high standards of this hotel, making our stay both meaningful and comfortable. We cannot thank them enough for their outstanding service! Location is in the heart of the city. You can go to all big malls nearby.
Rooms are pretty spacious.
Pool is small.
Breakfast options are too many with great ambiance.
Checkin and checkout process is pretty smooth.
Service is slow. I had a pleasant stay, and overall, the experience was good. The Executive Room is nice, but I feel it could be even better with a little touchup or renovation to enhance its appeal. The Club Lounge team was amazing, offering fantastic service, and the food and beverages served were also excellent. Id also like to mention how helpful the bellboy team wastruly appreciated!

I even asked for a quiet room in advance, but I can't sleep since the first day of my trip to Bangkok and it's so hard. Please change my room. It's my dad's birthday trip and I'm in such a difficult situation. Please change my room. Centre Point Hotel Silom in Bangkok offers a comfortable stay with its convenient location and wellappointed rooms. Situated in the heart of Silom, it provides easy access to both business and leisure destinations in the city. The hotel features spacious rooms that are clean and modern, equipped with essential amenities for a pleasant stay. The staff are friendly and accommodating, ensuring guests feel welcomed throughout their visit. Additionally, the hotel offers good facilities including a pool and fitness center, adding to the overall convenience and comfort of the stay. Overall, Centre Point Hotel Silom is a solid choice for travelers looking for a centrally located hotel with excellent service in Bangkok. Good views from the balcony, comfortable beds and pillows. Position of the hotel is convenient to the bts station. The facilities are also hightech. Have highquality wifi as well! The hotel has a great location, with the Robinson Mall attached, making it an excellent place for shopping and currency exchange. The rooms are clean and include a safety box and ironing facilities. Additionally, there is a washing machine available. The breakfast is decent but not exceptional. However, the housekeeping service is outstanding.

The main issue I encountered was managing the booking because it is not possible online. Furthermore, contacting the hotel is challenging they often do not respond to emails, so managing bookings may require a direct phone call. They need to improve this. Outstanding location central to ferry, sky rail, bus, tuk tuk and taxi. Renovations were annoying sending us outside in the rain to go into Robinson's supermarket when there was an internal connecting door and no work preventing it's use. Not a friendly choice.
Staff mostly friendly and helpful except on checkin who ignored everything we had paid for and stuck us in a lower standard room leaving us to fight for our paid rights for the next 4 days. I thought hotels had stopped this silly game 8 years ago. EG we booked a river view room. Got a 1metre wide river glimpse. Not on a high floor but the renovations caused that. However a quality hotel would have compt some favours to make up. They're just a little mean. And the continuous flow executive lounge was pointless offering nothing but what was already in the rooms. So a bit of false advertising there. Not worth paying extra for.
They also have a silly closing time for the otherwise lovely pool. Again unnecessarily officious. I realise they want to discourage rowdy behaviour but it's an unlicensed hotel so this is not likely. I have physio issues And needed the pool at the end of the night. They could if they cared code room keys for pool use for residents who sign off on no life guard and personal responsibility. No liability for the hotel.
Loved the kitchen and laundry facilities in the room. TV for English language viewing was rubbish. Sport and news. No movies. But in fairness that's all over Thailand these days.
Cleaning staff were fast and friendly and helpful. However the hotel would be smart to send them to make up a room whilst the occupants were at breakfast. Easy to arrange. We were out 1hrs for breakfast and returned to an unmade room. With Bangkok not opening till 10 or 11 am this left is sitting around in our own mess.

Rooms are modern and equipped with the latest technologies. Bathrooms are amazing and toilet seats are Japanese style, does everything for you.

Excellent customer service and staff are super friendly. They can even organize tours for you in the hotel so you feel safe.

Buffet breakfast is excellent with many varieties of food with an affordable price.

Very clean and modern hotel with a rooftop pool and bar to relax.

Also equipped with steamrooms, sauna as well and games rooms.

Highly recommended hotel and the area around is quiet and peaceful. Many food outlets and massage options. We had a pleasant stay and thought the service was good. Except for the noise from corridor can be heard in the room. I left a good review but now I change my mind.
After we checked out, the hotel charged us 70.62THB ??? because of the stain on a hand towel. Completely ruined our mood.
As a fivestar hotel, it seems very ungenerous.
At first, he said that this towel could not be cleaned. When we said the towel would be given
to us, he changed the  statements and said that it should be sent for deep cleaning??? Well, I dont believe it. Newly opened hotel everything was so clean. We love the room  japanese style bathroom. Breakfast was so tasty  wide variation of food. Fitness center was complete with kettle bells.
However, the location was far from everything. Free shuttle only runs once an hour. Also, the hotel was full of that loud talking tourists, not to mention in the games room  swimming pool, so noisy. Great place to stay while in Bangkok, rooms are spacious and modern. Great team and nice facilities on the rooftop. Really nice to enjoy the pool after a long day of walk in the city !

Breakfast is great with various choices.

Close to many transport options not far from nigjt market. This hotel is the best hotel I ever stayed. Firstly the hotel is very new and highly fercilitised. From the check in, process was easy and the lobby is welcoming. Room was fantastic that we got an complimentary upgrade to higher floor stayed room 1906. This room is spacious and furniture was brand new, bathroom was amazing. Especially the super king size bed was extemly comfortable! I had an wonderful sleep ever among whole my travel. I visited Bangkok during rainy season, when it's rain, I could go free game room upstairs and kill the time.. All the staff was super friendly. If you are looking for a clean and new building, this is the perfect place to stay. Highly recommended!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Millennium Hilton Bangkok,"123 Charoen Nakhon Rd, Khwaeng Khlong Ton Sai, Khet Khlong San, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10600, Thailand",4.5,13.7284021,100.5095113,"We had a wonderful stay at this Hilton. The staff was amazingso friendly and helpful. Our room on the tenth floor was quiet and comfortable. We had a great view of the river. The pool was beautiful and had a wonderful view of the river and city. We also enjoyed the daily happy hour at the pool. We ate breakfast in The Lantern coffee shop one day where they had a nice selection of pastries. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant twice because it was convenient, had a great view of the river and the food was delicious. Our server, New Koi, was very pleasant and provided great service both times. We also received a discount when dining at the hotel.
The location of the hotel couldn't be better. It is steps away from the Icon Siam Mall, the largest mall I've ever been to. It has world class shopping, many restaurants and so much more. The ferry to cross the river is right behind the hotel and runs back and forth all day, so it's easy to catch a ride.
The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and airy. We would definitely stay here again. Diamond member. I thought it was a tad bit tacky that the employees in the executive lounge kept asking me to leave a review with their names on it so that they could get promoted by HR. When Im on vacation and in the executive lounge, I dont want to be bothered with that burden.
Also, the employees in the executive lounge kept asking me about my stay. I told three people on separate occasions that the water from our shower head was weak. The drain in our suite did not work well. We were staying in the execute twin room and it was just unacceptable. It was as if it went in one ear and out the other because no one seemed to care when they asked how our room was. Why ask then? I liked the location but common, Hilton. Do better. The food in the lounge was really good though and I appreciated the parking staff downstairs for helping us get a cab and making sure we wouldnt be overcharged. We chose this because it's right next to Icon Siam, could walk over in 5 minutes.
All resorts in Thailand had a welcome drink, none here. Check in process was pretty slow.
Rooms are classy and have a pleasant feel at the same time. Only negative is the charging points almost near the floor.

We visited the 360 degree rooftop bar, food and drinks both great.

Swimming pool is one of the best I've been to. Very well maintained, Optimal depth, optimal chlorine levels, clean water.
Nicely mainted gym as well Yes, I realize it is a franchise hotel chain, but it is in a great location and can be a great value if booked during the offseason rainy season.

If you have never been to Thailand and a little nervous for your first trip.  The Millennium Hilton is a great location.  It is secured and right next to one of the largest and most modern malls in Bangkok  Icon Siam.

The river is wonderful to stay along as you watch and experience the many commercial and private boats.  The hotel has its own boat which will take you along various stops close to the hotel.

The Icon Siam mall offers shopping, refined dining, and traditional street food all inside and next door.

Of course, for first time nervous travelers, the hotel provides the many comforts of the western world with an incredible breakfast, a beautiful pool on the 3rd or 4th floors, and both an open air and enclosed rooftop restaurant.  To make getting there easy from the airport, just ask the hotel to coordinate with their taxi service that works directly with the hotel.  They can be waiting at the airport to pick you up with anything from a Camry to a Mercedes.  Too easy.

Remember, Thailand has the rainy and dry seasons no fall or winter.  The dry season is when room prices are the most expensive.  We found the best time was during the end of the rainy season  SeptemberOctober.  We paid a little over 100night for the same room that was almost 400night just two months later.  Timing is everything.

If you have never been, I encourage you to at least visit once.  Exchange rate is wonderful but still be prepared for the ""tourist"" price.

Enjoy and let me know if I can answer any of your questions. After visiting the Millennium Hilton Hotel for the first time in two years, I was truly impressed. The staff, from the lobby to the lounge, were exceptionally kind. The friendly smiles from everyone made my time there very enjoyable.

I especially want to mention the lounge staff. My previous experiences with the lounge staff were marked by adequate friendliness or a somewhat formal demeanor. However, this time, the lounge team was warm and personable.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Ms. Freya. Thanks to her, my stay with my mom was incredibly comfortable, and she enjoyed it immensely. She is not only kind but also has excellent communication skills. Conversations with her were delightful and cheerful. I look forward to seeing her again next time.

Thank you, everyone.",no operation time,"lodging, spa, point_of_interest, establishment"

I forgot my watch while checking out and they emailed me, and sent the watch to my country, thank you so much for your honesty.

It is my first time and definitely not my last. Great quality and high class hotel. The rooms were amazing as there was a couch like a living room, a huge closet, free complimentary treats and drinks, as well as a huge bathroom with a bathtub and a shower. Amenities are also free here. The service was excellent and the staff were very friendly, and public services provided were the swimming pool, spa, a freeflow bar, and 2 European restaurants. There was also a free buggy golf cart service to Siam Paragon, which makes it very convenient as its near the Siam station. Overall, it was a great hotel, with the only downside being construction near the bridge, which blocked off pedestrians from walking on the bridge. This hotel is truly classy. It's very Thai luxury classic hotel and has the authentic Thai hospitality. The staff at the front desk is really attentive, every single one of them. They pay close attention to detail, even when people are eating their buffet. The pool is huge and the ambiance at the pool is great, mornings or the evenings. Highly recommend! Our first stay with Chatrium Grand, and right from the first moment, everything has been wonderful.
The rooms are lovely and all staff are very attentive and helpful.
We had access to the club level, and the service, food and drink for all sessions was faultless.
This is truly a premium hotel of quality, with my personal view being the staff as the standout, as a long term Thailand traveller. Everything is great, except one of the front desk member whose name is Earth. He seems like he didnt want to service us. Hes lack of service mind. Unlike another woman beside him, she is an excellent example of a good staff. She informs us nicely and gives all details to us.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

However, the rooms are spacious, nice, and clean. The staff was very friendly. My room was on the 3rd floor and quiet. Terminal 21, Sports Bar, and many other places are within walking distance. Great value for money hotel right in the middle of the entertainment district but back from the main roads so quiet. There are Teo buildings one with rooms and restaurant and the other gym, pool and rooms. Service is very good and rooms comfortable. I stayed at Night Hotel in Bangkok from August 18th to 21st in room 808, and I had a satisfying experience. The staff were exceptionally kind, always holding the door open and greeting me with bright smiles, which helped me start each day on a positive note. The hotel offers a free tuktuk service to Asok Station, which made it very convenient for me to come and go as I pleased. The drivers were also very friendly, making the short trips to the station enjoyable. Breakfast was another highlight, especially the egg dishes and guava juice, although after staying for three nights, I found the menu slightly repetitive, but still, it was excellent value for the price. The hotel also has a variety of facilities like a swimming pool and gym, which I appreciated. The gym, in particular, was quiet, allowing me to exercise comfortably without any disturbances. If I ever return to Bangkok, I will definitely stay at Night Hotel again. Fantastic hotel in the heart of Bangkok. Lots of room options to choose from when booking, depending on your budget.

Staff were friendly and helpful.

Room was quiet, spotlessly clean and the bathroom was fully supplied with toiletriesamenities.

Breakfast is available, with healthy choices on the buffet, and an eggomlette station.

Overall, the hotel is exactly as advertised, and it was a pleasant stay.","Monday: Open 24 hours

I won't rate the hotel very high looking at the present status. The room at the lower floors require maintenance. We were first allocated rooms on 12th floor that required some major improvements. One evening the AC water started flowing continuously, my luggage got spoiled. My parents room Mini bar wasn't filled not even on the first day. The cleaning wasn't regular even after switching on the 'Make My room' sign on the doorway. Not many vegetarian options in the breakfast. The staff at most places were hospitable. The bell boys were very helpful. Front office were mostly straight face and requires more training in taking care of guests from other countries. The lift do not come on time owing to higher floors. The location can be a bit of during rush hours where there's huge traffic outside. I will have to give it a miss next time am visiting Bangkok. Had one sky bedroom suite on the 34th floor.
Spacious living room and smaller bedroom.
Large bathroom with both shower and bath tab.
Had  a narrow balcony as well, with quite a city view.
Service generally was quite poor.
I gave them 2 dresses for laundry and they almost lost them. Not only they had not brought them to my room at promised hour but when I went to the consierge to ask for them they couldn't even find where my dresses were...
Finally after 2 hours they found them.
Food also below average and room service until only 9.30 pm!
Last but not least, communication in English with staff not that easy. Me and my Thai wife like to stay here when we are traveling in Bangkok. The staff is very friendly and always very helpful. The pool area is very good on the 2nd floor.. the drinks are delicious too. I love to drink the coconut smoothies . We particularly like Mister Pepsi. He is always here when we are and we like him a lot 
We are sure the hotel wouldn't be the same without him. Thank you Pepsi, my friend  No complaints. YES there is some work that could be done as the age kind of shows at various locations.. Other than that, staff was friendly and room was a good value for the price. great location, the service is not really top and the food not good. but the bar top is superb. nice view. that is all. So toresume if you search for a roof top not so expensive and want to enjoy music, cocktails and easy food thats the place to be","Monday: Open 24 hours

The latest electronic systems are used to streamline security checks, ensuring that passengers pass through smoothly and efficiently while maintaining high safety standards. Additionally, selfservice kiosks are conveniently located throughout the airport, allowing travelers to complete their procedures quickly and easily.

No electric kettle. No soup. Little Shampoo and body lotion in the dispensers. I did a reservation with them but I needed to do an early check in, so I instantly called them and texted them in Booking, but no reply. As I've never had any problem with early check ins I thought it would be okay, but, for my surprise, when I arrive to the hostel at 8, they say I need to pay 200 bahts to do the check in now, or do the check in now and the check out at 1pm, which make no sense. I asked to talk to the manager or someone else, but the girl at the reception just said no, while laughing. I told her that's not acceptable, costumers have the right of speaking with the manager if requested, she just said no again.
Rude staff, unbelievable bad treat. I couldn't open the door before I could lock it. Makes me turn on too hard The male housekeeper is a bit elderly. So he walked over and scolded me. He is very rude. He looked at my face closely. staring with fierce eyes and does not speak politely This was the worst stay experience of my life, it was not safe at all.

Even if hotel is fully sold out it can be informed prior or can be communicated in a better way.

Rest of the staff was helpful, room was spacious and easily able to accommodate 3 people, breakfast was decent and has few vegetarian options. As we checked out pretty early staff helped to pack breakfast for us as well. Overall hotel stay is decent, and location was convenient There are a lot of tours, so I booked a costeffective hotel, but the location is good and the view is good. It is small but has a pretty swimming pool and a bar, so there is no shortage at all.
I had the best time in such a peaceful and beautiful pool with great service! Thanks to Wit, Aim's good service, I think my memories in Bangkok will be remembered well. I will also visit and make pleasant and happy memories  I have been this for the second time. Same service  quality very great. Price wise it is very good for the location, just about 10min walk to the station. Nice distance away from the most busy area. Staff Bee, Kevin, Day, Win are very nice and helpful, from checkin to storing my luggage there. Will come back again Very good hotel. Great value. Excellent breakfast. Very helpful concierge and bell desk.special mention to Din and Winnie who are exceptional in their friendly service and willingness to make your stay comfortable.  Hopefully the hotel can reopen its fine dining restaurants which have been closed for some time now. We took an upscale suite room with balcony, to enhance my experience of last year. Big disappointment. We arrived at 2pm but the room was not ready until 5pm.  When we finally were allowed in, it was so dirty that Mr. Din offered to change it immediately.  We were too tired to wait for another delay, but we took the offer for the next day. The next room was obviously renewed, but the counters were just as dirty and too many things were wrong. A minibar with cabinet for cups, dishes, silverware, etc. had nothing in it only an unplugged refrigerator. There was yet another minibar with missing shelves, totally useless.  There were phone outlets in four places, but only one phone in the bedroom while there should be at least two. A small television was at a corner, totally out of place for viewing. The bathrooms were reworked but had shoddily patched walls, no toilet paper dispenser.  The moldy showers had cracks where water would go in.  A bathroom closet had a light that stayed on day and night because the dooractivated switch was in the wrong place. What was right? What stood out was the attitude of the hotel people. Although it is evident that training is missing, they were always trying to help and make things right.  Of course they cant fix the bathroom walls or polish the countertops, but they could take training to learn consistency.  One day there would be two glasses, another day none. Glasses we left in the terrace were never picked up. The minibar drinks were replenished only sometimes, at random. Toilet paper was insufficient and we had to use the other bathroom. Overall, I think it would be helpful for some personnel to stay at another hotel to see how nice a stay can be.","Monday: Open 24 hours

When we arrived there at 11pm !, we were told that our reservation got cancelled we didnt get an email that the reservation got cancelled and no refund at that time. Additionally, they told us that we could stay if we paid a price three times higher than the original one. We werent the only ones with this problem, two other customers got cancelled too. It seems like a scam to us. We definitely cant recommend this accomodation. Great value for a onestar rated hotel. I would consider staying at this property again. The staff are super friendly and helpful. Clean linens and the room is spacious.

I enjoyed the firmness of the beds as well. The pillows are super comfortable which is great support for the neck. Not those flimsy pillows found at some hotels.

Nature Boutique Hotel is within minutes to the sky train. Overall, a good experience at great price. We booked on Check24 and after we arrived here the reservation were cancelled by the hotel.

The rooms are spacious, the breakfast selection is good, the staff provides excellent service, and they have their own Lawson convenience store inside which is a super convenient feature for travelers and their own massage spa with a very affordable price! We also enjoyed their pool and the river view from our room. I will stay here again when I return to Bangkok! Its a beautiful premise at a very nice location, very convenient if you like to stay by the river and take boat rides. Icon Siam is within 10 minutes walking distance, and you can take public ferry and organized cruise from there.
The hotel is relatively new, the rooms and amenities of the hotel looks very nice like the pictures shown. Staff are very helpful and friendly. We also enjoyed the convenient store and massage place with very reasonable price inside the hotel.

My only complaint is that the toilet in one of our room at lower level 3rd floor has an unpleasant smell like from sewage, which is the same case with the toilets in the lobby and in the restaurant. Hopefully the hotel can look into improving that.

Overall its a beautiful experience staying at this hotel! The hotel has terrible customer service. While I was eating lunch and hurrying to check out, the staff approached me about an outstanding balance for breakfast. I recalled that I had already paid and asked them to check again. Instead of resolving it quietly, they made a scene at the front desk, drawing the attention of everyone around. The manager's condescending attitude only added to our frustration. It's disappointing that they can't handle such situations more effectively. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone their service is lacking, and the room design is impractical as well. The location is a 10minute walk to Iconsiam, and most of the staff are from the Philippines and Myanmar, so quite a few do not speak Thai. Communication with nonThai Filipino staff during checkin can be quite frustrating, beyond just language barriers. Although they speak English well, their comprehension and adaptability are below standard. The rooms cleanliness is poor. The floor is extremely dirty, there are many watermarks on the table, and when you turn on the water in the shower booth, soap bubbles from the previous guest rise from the floor due to lack of cleaning. It's to the point where you can identify what body wash and shampoo they used.

Because of the boats running throughout the night, if you're a light sleeper, you might not be able to sleep all night. Really nice hotel. Lots of weird reviews here. You don't have to ask for a river view room. The pool has a direct view of the river. There are two good restaurants.

The convenience is in the hotel. Sauna, fitness center, and pool are free.

You can walk to Icosiam in less than ten minutes.

The staff were super friendly and helpful. The service with a smile made our stay even more enjoyable.

The family suite was a bit smaller than I had hoped for but manageable.

Hotel restaurants were great but staying in Bangkok we did try a few external restaurants on our excursions.

Thank you Riverside for our lovely stay. Review of Anantara Riverside Bangkok Hotel

We spent a wonderful weekend at the Anantara Riverside Bangkok Hotel and would like to share our experiences.

On our first evening, we dined at Brio, the hotel's Italian restaurant. It was an exceptionally great evening, made unforgettable especially by the warm care of Ms. New. Her dedication, attentiveness, and attention to detail made our visit truly special.

The Vitello Tonnato that Ms. New prepared fresh at our table was simply outstanding. Overall, the entire menu and wine list were excellent.

A big shoutout to Brio and to Ms. New! Thank you for this unforgettable evening. We will definitely be back! We had a short stay at the Anantara Riverside resort recently.

First off the bellboys, greeters and front desk staff were excellent and a wonderful introduction to the location. As far as Im concerned they are your first impression and they all deserve a raise.

They were helpful, knowledgeable, courteous with a good sense of humor.

All the other staff we interacted with were also top notch. They have built a really great team here.

The location is perfect for a few days exploring Bangkok, and although the property feels a bit aged its quite clean.

Will happily be back.

Logan This hotel kind of sucks. The food is terrible, almost to the point of inedible. The breakfast is not great. Soft boiled eggs were literally watery. Gross. I skipped breakfast after my first day because it was just not well done.

The service is terrible, relative to other Bangkok hotels. If youre gauging it on a western scale 3.5 stars, if youre gauging it against other Bangkok or Asian 5 star hotels hotels its maybe 1.52 stars.

Takes forever to get service by the pool, they make stupid excuses as to why theyre not able to accommodate your requests and ultimately the food is horrible. Cheap quality ingredients and super over priced as well which wouldnt be a factor if it was actually good or decent ingredients. Expect prices to be 20 more than other actual 5 star hotels that actually deserve the stars.

The north wing beds are mildewy, apart from the top floor. The south wing rooms are dark and outdated and have horrible lighting. The TV doesnt have a good list of channels if you want to watch sports, they do not show EPL or anything like this on the tv.

Comfortable bed.

The gym is pretty decent. Can get a good workout in here. The pool is always crowded.

The river that it sits on smells terrible, like septic all over the place.

They do cool features like an ice plunge but overall the service over here really tanks the place. And the food is atrocious. I drank the Worst coffee Ive ever had in Bangkok, a city filled with great coffee.

Also the shower is so weird. Your bathroom floods every time you take a shower.

Was here for an event and will never consider staying here again.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The room is very comfortable and the sofa bed is prepared in advance for the children.
The swimming pool is great but we didn't have the chance to use it this time.
Thank you to the hotel for the rooftop drink coupon.
It happened to be a date when alcohol was not available, but the whole coconut was very nice at the rooftop bar.

The front desk service and room service are also very good. Now if you need supplies, you can scan the QR code on the table.

I am writing so much because this time my family stayed one night each week and they were very happy.
I would like to express my gratitude and will definitely stay here again next time I go to Bangkok. Nice hotel, room also nice and comfortable. Staff also friendly and always smile to customer.
Hotel is 5 minutes walk to the nearest BTS station and emporium mall. You can find a lot of restaurant in this area and 7 eleven is near the hotel too. I did enjoy staying here for 3 nights! All the employees were welcoming us and were willing to help guests as much as possible. The location was really great to travel in Bangkok and there were tons of great restaurants and massage places nearby. Also, the guy at the ground floor was very kind and humorous that we could exchange small jokes and I could feel the warmth from Thai people. I recently had an unparalleled experience at the Hyatt Place Bangkok Sukhumvit    . The hotels environment truly meets fivestar standards, featuring a stunning pool and large windows in the rooms that offer breathtaking views. The natural scenery visible from the windows is captivating, whether in the morning or evening.

The rooms are equipped with modern amenities, including a comfortable bed, a spacious bathroom, and a welldesigned workspace. The decor is elegant and contemporary, providing a relaxing and luxurious atmosphere. The staff were incredibly friendly and considerate, always greeting guests with a smile, which made me feel right at home.

Moreover, the restaurants food was outstanding, offering a wide variety of choices to satisfy all tastes. This is definitely one of the most highly recommended hotels I have ever stayed at. Thank you, Hyatt Place Bangkok Sukhumvit, for providing such a wonderful experience! I and my boyfriend had a good time here. Everyone was very friendly, attentive staff. The room was clean, the atmosphere was great. They have the rooftop bar where we can see the sunset, but the food was not meet my expectations.","Monday: Open 24 hours

On arrival they tried to get to to book again because it is cheaper on a certain website.  I explained I have booked and payed nonfundable.  So no way will I do something like this.   They took a picture of my phone and sent me to a tiny smelly room with parting all night outside the window.   Let's just say I'm not returning. The room was clean and I slept well.

Good location, plenty of inside restaurants that cater for every taste. Excellent breakfast, plenty of choices, hot and cold, savoury and sweet.
The club lounge is nice but the lack of dressing code not to mention manners makes it not a place where you would like to relax during the cocktail time or breakfast. Pity.
The G suite is spacious and comfortable. However in need of upgrades and renovation albeit the staff goes above and beyond to keep it immaculate. Where do I begin with this wonderful experience in Pullman hotel Bangkok. Best holidays ever, location,service rooms breakfast club lounge cocktails everything was to a high standard. All the staff was excellent trying to please everyone, including the very demanding with a smile and kindness. I wanted to cry few times when I was witnessing abuse and very low standards visitors. Thanks Thailand, Im going back home with very fond memories, and Ill be back with more friends so they will experience the same things. While the staff and service are fantastic, the rooms desperately need an upgrade. Switch sockets don't work properly, TVs are outdated. The remote doesn't even work unless it's a straight line, no microwave, fridge barely cools anything. Can hear all the sounds of the city even on the 33rd floor. Definitely consider a more modern hotel with modern amenities. The hotel is nice, and the view from the 34th floor is amazing. Breakfast is fine, although for a fivestar hotel, it's average. As for the lounge access, Im not sure if it's worth it  there are quite a lot of people, the alcohol is okay, and there are small snacks, but that's about it. The fitness center is good, but the pool is very small, and the sauna is located in the bathrooms by the pool. Overall, I would rate the experience 35. We were served by MY when  checking into the hotel on 10 Sep 2024.  Shes very helpful in providing us with all the necessary info we need to make our stay comfortable.

Throughout the duration of our stay she will regularly come into the executive lounge to check that we are ok and if we require anything else to make our stay comfortable.

We stayed at Loy La Long Hotel for 2 nights, and it was a truly magical experience! Located right by the Chao Phraya River, this charming hotel feels like a gateway to authentic Thai culture. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making us feel at home from the moment we arrived .

We stayed in the Red Room, which was beautifully decorated with traditional Thai elements. The ambiance was cozy and unique, giving us a real taste of Thailand . Waking up to a delicious breakfast with a stunning river view was the perfect way to start our day .

The hotel is also perfectly situated to explore another side of Bangkok. Just a few minutes' walk away is Chinatown, where you can dive into vibrant street life. Plus, the area is filled with hip restaurants and bars, offering a trendy vibe thats perfect for evening outings .

A big shoutout to the amazing staff who went above and beyond for us. An incident occurred during our stay, and the staff woke up at midnight to help us resolve it. Their dedication and helpfulness truly made our stay exceptional. If you're looking for a place to unwind, immerse yourself in Thai culture, and explore a different face of Bangkok, Loy La Long Hotel is the spot . Highly recommend, and we cant wait to come back . This restaurant is a true hidden gem tucked away along the Chao Phraya River. It located in the hotel which is in the Pathumkongkaram temple. While it may be difficult to find, it's absolutely worth the effort! The menu offers a delightful exploration of authentic Thai cuisine with a thoughtful twist on ingredients. It's clear they use fresh, highquality products, resulting in dishes that are bursting with flavor.

One standout dish is the crispy pork. It's so delicious, I can't recommend it enough! Each bite is a perfect balance of textures and tastes. Every dish I've tried has been equally impressive, showcasing a creative take on traditional flavors. The menu itself is very wellcurated, offering a variety of options to suit different preferences without feeling overwhelming.

The riverside location adds to the charm of this hidden gem. It creates a lovely ambiance for a special occasion or a memorable night out.

Tips  Be sure to make reservations in advance for the sunset spot In low touristy season when they don't have many guests staying, it's a perfect place to relax with a cool drink and a bite all tasty. Perfect place to unwind  after exploring chinatown. Friendly staff too. I came here for Chao Phraya sunset so trying their restaurant down there. Very cute and pretty place.  Altho a bit of effort to find the location as its hidden behind temple and in between local housing. Limited seat of course but got lucky with main seat facing the river and see pagoda and cruises and boats forth and back. Food are good, service are good, waiting time is good. Toilet available very cute and clean.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM

We had great brunch, high tea and room service. Their buffet line is wonderful.

The room is big and bed is comfy. They have always offered a room upgrade for us at check in. View from the room is perfect. We love it.

The shuttle boat and tuktuk is probably another highlight to mention for this place. Recommend to try.

Staff are super attentive and nice.

I would give it the best riverside hotel experience in Bangkok. We had a wonderful experience at the Peninsula Bangkok.  If you want to be pampered, this is the place to go. Felt like such a peaceful oasis in the business of Bangkok.  We were so well taken care of the by staff, the room was impeccable and we were provided with new goodies every day. Delicious breakfast buffet with impressive river views and a plethora of options! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Overall was good. Very clean. Boat to Iconsiam was a nice amenity. Breakfast was AMAZING. Only flaw was we booked the Dinner buffet and no drinks but coffee and tea were included. We just wanted water and they charged us 4usd for tap water. Which whatever its 4.00 but its the point. They provide still water in the rooms and gyms but not during a dinner buffet? Thought was strange. Stunning hotel. Rooms are amazing. Pool is perfect. Food is a little pricey.

The step is littered with amazing places to eat!
When you get to the pool ask for Otto! He has been more than helpful in guiding us and getting us what we needed! Literally not a single thing to complain about. Everything is perfect, rooms top notch clean, staff amazing, services great, unlimited coffee available all day. We spent lots of time in the hotel just because it's such great experience. I'm still here right now, I just had to take a moment out of my day to write this review. Highly recommend to anyone. Overall its cosmetically a nice place, but Ill never come here again.
Problem 1 the night we checked in, they gave us a keycard that gave us access to only our room, and nothing else. Therefore if we wanted to leave our room to use the fitness room, pool, elevator, etc, we had to call someone to be escorted.
Problem 2 the breakfast selection is good, but its nearly the same this everyday. Coming here for 2 weeks, it literally makes me sick eating the same thing everyday.
Problem 3 one night I wanted to use the pool I double checked the hours its open, and upon my arrival, the pool was closed hours early with no prior notification.
Problem 4 from about midnight till 1am when I complained they decided to do maintenance on the elevator outside my room. This for some reason involved a hammer and beating something over and over again. Once I complained, they stopped.
Problem 5 housekeeping does a poor job, doesnt vacuum the floor, pick up the hair, refill the snacks and beverages accordingly. This isnt my house I shouldnt be responsible for cleaning. Very nice hotel, excellent service. We especially want to highlight the service provided by ""Otto"" from the pool staff. We had an accident with our son, and he was there immediately, offering caring assistance! Fantastic! That's exactly how it should be! Everything else was positive as wellgood food, wonderful rooms, and comfortable beds. This is our second trip to this superb luxury hotel and I cannot say enough good things about our stay! First, we are greeted by front staff who quickly assist us with our bags and deliver them to our room. Check in staff also very friendly and helpful. As we enter into the room it is very clean and spacious with free mini bar and WiFi provided. The city view was spectacular through the cleanest windows I have ever seen. The bathroom was spotless and well equipped and the hot water for the shower was plentiful! The heated toilet seat was a bonus as were the various cleaning options!! Housekeeping staff did a great job servicing the room quickly.
The Tuk Tuk was very prompt back and forth to the Thong Lo BTS. Finally, the restaurant staff were awesome no matter the meal time. The food choices are plentiful and delicious. The dinner host was VERY professional and friendly no matter how busy he was! I only wish I could give 10 stars to this very fine hotel and staff! Thank you to everyone for making our stay so enjoyable!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Breakfast is around 300 baht per person, and they serve good yogurt without added sugar and a delicious omelet. While the pricetoquality ratio is good, the room had a strong musty smell, likely from mold, despite the ceiling being freshly painted. The staff is friendly, but storage and hanging space for clothes is limited. The shower is excellent with strong water pressure, and the gym is wellequipped, even with air conditioning. And a good parking place for your car with lovely staff. Great location for an old backpacker who was looking to relive the experience at an elevated level. Room was large and well equipped bathroom and shower area were like a spa! I spent more time in my room than I thought I would because of this! Breakfast had everything you could ask for and it was great that service started at 6am, great way to start the day. Staff was very friendly. I took advantage of everything except the very well equipped weight room and really enjoyed the tranquility of the spa. Slightly more expensive than the street level massage parlors, but an elevated experience. It was great to have the pool to dip in as well after exploring. For the price and location, everything I could have asked for! Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough! Affordable and fancy hotel in central Bangkok. Staff are friendly and helpful. Prior to my arrival, they were very responsive to emails and made me feel reassured. I was able to book an affordable and reliable airport pickup through the hotel. The included breakfast is delicious and hearty. I appreciated the water bottle filling service available in the lobby so reduce bottled water consumption. The bathroom shower felt luxurious. Strong wifi which made it easy to connect with people back home. The pool is gorgeous, the gym is a great amenity. They also offered a discount on Thai massages in the hotel. Wish I could stay here longer! I was there to pick up my tourists and they accompanied me to see the hotel rooftop, fitness, spa, restaurant I have tried for drinks and swimming pools as well as kid's zone. The hotel is nice and near to the historical sites and Khaosan road. Spacious lobby and toilet available for waiting the clients at the hall. Comfortable for all. The hotel was clean and wellkept. The staff were very friendly and helpful. All food are halal and there were plenty of selections at the breakfast buffet. It was not as close to the city center as other hotels, but if you value peace away from bumbling city noises and far away from clubs, this is a good option.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Right from your arrivalyou are greeted with warm and genuine Thai hospitality. Everybody makes eye contact and is friendly. Rooms are spacious with nice views. Food is very good  great menus that cater for various international guests. Nice breakfast. Pool, tennis court and gym. Overalla great hotel  well done to the GM Mr Kim and his team  recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Bangkok and had a fantastic experience. The hotels location is unbeatable, right in the heart of the city and close to major attractions and public transportation. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, making my stay comfortable and enjoyable.

The room was spacious and wellmaintained, with modern amenities and a great view of the city. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, ensuring a good night's rest. I also enjoyed the hotel's facilities, including the pool and fitness center.

One highlight was the dining experience. The breakfast buffet offered a diverse selection of delicious options, and the service was excellent.

Overall, the Holiday Inn Bangkok provided great value for money and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the city. A bit daggy and starchy. I stayed here after having an excellent stay at the Holiday Inn Express, also in Silom but closer to Chong Nonsi station. Honestly I would go back to that hotel instead  it was fresh, modern and comfortable. This place was very spacious and quiet but extremely 'browge' browngreen beige. Bathroom was lovely but the beds were sagging and uncomfortable. That said, the service here was impeccable, just so friendly and helpful. Our honeymoon stay at Holiday Inn Bangkok Silom was absolutely unforgettable! From the moment we arrived, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel special and welcomed. The hotel itself is stunning, with a beautiful ambiance that perfectly complements its prime location in Bangkok. The food was exceptional, offering a delightful array of options to satisfy our taste buds. However, the real highlight of our stay was the Executive Club. The service was topnotch, with every staff member going out of their way to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. Overall, our experience was nothing short of amazing, and we would highly recommend Holiday Inn Bangkok Silom to anyone looking for a luxurious and romantic getaway in the heart of Bangkok. An extremely awesome stay, combined with a perfect ambience and a lovely gastronomic experience made our stay at this beautiful hotel a wonderful one. The check in process was smooth with Ginger and YoYo at the check in who were brilliant. The chefs at the restaurant deserve a pat on their back who ensured that our vegetarian diet was catered on. A wonderful layout at the buffet breakfast was an icing on the cake. The concierge service led by Sam made our experience super who were always ready with a smile. All in all, a highly recommended place with my possibility of going there once again. Kudos to the entire team!!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Riverfront Bangkok,"912 เอสวี ซิตี้ Thanon Rama Ill, Khwaeng Bang Phong Phang, Khet Yan Nawa, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10120, Thailand",4.2,13.6720565,100.5434294,"It's advertised as a 4 but the room condiments, rock hard pillows and prisonstyle shower doesn't reach that standard 2  3 maximum.

It's cheap though and comfortable enough with a sofa and a small, practical kitchen.

The free parking is useful once you work out where the entrance is and the complex process of registering your car every time you come and go.

The ""mall"" itself is more reminiscent of a homeless centre with a cellar food hall and fragmented, sparse shops.

The views from the balcony are great once you get over the rusting barriers that look like they'll collapse if you lean on them! Nice room for our family of 4. Great view over the river.

The staff were amazingly helpful! Excellent hotel very clean and very roomy.. and the view was awesome overlooking the river... If I could give them six stars for being polite I wish I could extremely polite and helpful staff!! Located on Rama 3, the river front rooms are good. Price are also reasonable. The place is fairly maintained. SV mall is also accessible for resturants and shopping. Overall Recommended!! Well, positioned apartments, rooms are large and comfortable,  with essential items provided. Large swimming pool, a joins other complexes. Close walk to a small shopping centre, with restaurants, cafes, hairdressers, massage shops, and 711 convenience store.

Everyone was kind and considerate. Every morning at the breakfast buffet, I had fresh fruit, fresh salad, a variety of freshly made stir fry and vegetarian favorites, spicy garlic morning glory greens, chefmade, frothed milk custom flavored lattes, and finished with pastry such as a butter croissant with the notable house made vanilla custard sauce. During date night, at the blue sky restaurant on the top floor, our server Keng made sure to put a personal touch on our complimentary dessert, as pictured, making us feel very welcomed. My 2024 birthday family dinner at Blue Sky bar and restaurant was splendid. Ken and Ploy paid attention to my reservation details regarding allergies for my kids, and ensured we got served appropriately.
The kids had burger while we shared the platter as couple. Good food.
The cleanliness, ambience and skyline view added spice to the evening.

Id recommend. It was my first time staying at the hotel. Great lobby with large walking areas. The front desk receptionist is very friendly and very much helpful.
Room has a good view to look at the city area surroundings. Like it especially when sitting next to windows while doing so work of drink coffee. Old hotel, in desperate need of renovations. It is not keeping up with other hotels in Bangkok. Beds are very uncomfortable, the 1300 baht breakfast is a joke. You get 10x higher quality and 10x more choices from any hotel downtown. I would have given the breakfast 5 stars if it was 300 baht. It is crowded in the morning and very loud. The hotel is very conveniently located next to the train station. The breakfast spread is good and they have halal options for Muslims and also delicious Indian food. We had the opportunity to taste the best Masala Chai in Bangkok served by Chef Arun who is also in charge of the Indian food. The overall facilities including the meeting rooms are also very good. The staff are all very courteous and polite. Really had a good time staying here.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The hotel is beautifully designed, with a chic modern aesthetic and stunning views of the river that make it feel like a true oasis in the city.

The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, making us feel right at home throughout our visit.

Special thanks to Ploy who is always smiling and helping us during our breakfast.

From the gorgeous infinity pool to the delicious meals, every moment was a delight! Check out some of these photos from our stay. If youre in Bangkok, this place is a mustvisit! Fantastic hotel. Top class in every way. Amazing breakfasts with global selection catered for. My room was extremely comfortable and spacious. Staff extremely friendly and courteous. Wouldnt hesitate to rebook next time I visit Bangkok! I love this hotel. The staff were amazing, very attentive and helpful. I had a suite room, had an amazing view and it was spacious and very clean. The breakfast had many variations and had amazing views in the river side. Did not have a chance to use the pool on the roof top. Overall, I spend 8 nights over there and it was a very pleasant stay. Highly attentive staff that will see to all your needs, responsive too.
Great views from the pool and rooftop restaurant.
I love the complimentary shuttle service to and from the hotel pier to others. Our stay at the Avani Riverside Plus Hotel was outstanding. Two rooms we stayed in were spotless, with every detail meticulously taken care of, making the space feel clean and comfortable.

The breakfast selection was impressive, offering a wide variety of choices to suit different tastes. Everything was fresh, very wellprepared, including both local and international dishes.

The views of the Chao Praya River were truly magnificent. The large windows throughout the hotel provided stunning views, especially during sunrise and sunset.

We also enjoyed the pool on the 26th floor with fantastic panoramic views of the city and river, and the rooftop bar and restaurant offer amazing food. It is also worth mentioning that as guests you get a complimentary boat service from the neighbouring Anantara Hotel to both Sathorn and Iconsiam piers running every 30 or 60 minutes.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The morning buffet is a standout feature, providing a delicious and varied selection to start your dayits definitely worth it.

Located in the heart of Chinatown, the hotel is perfect for shoppers and those looking to explore the vibrant local markets. Plus, theres plenty of street food available at night, adding to the convenience and charm of the area.

Overall, a fantastic choice for a stay in Bangkok! It is located in the heart of Chinatown, close to the subway and the boat, which makes getting around the city very easy.
Vibrant markets and street food are very close by which makes the experience very interesting.
The rooms are good, clean and quiet, although the bathrooms need updating.
The breakfast is good and varied.
The terrace offers a magnificent view over the city. A nice hotel only a block away from Chinatown. There is a cafe and a sturbucks on the ground floor. Rooms are neat and clean. Service is great. The location is good, not far from some major sights. Its easy to find a place to eat out of the hotel. And the view from the bar and the swimming pool is the best. I booked this hotel because of its location.

It is literally 2 blocks from the action of China town night market and I would say that is the main selling point.

Having read the horror stories about exorbitant fees for usage that could be interpreted as damage, I was not the most comfortable in the room. First night a huge roach was in the bathroom which housekeeping graciously removed. Bidet was unusable I use this as a measure of cleanliness in hotels. At 175 cm my head was near touching the ceiling in the shower and ceilings in parts of the room were very low. The rooms are dated but bed was comfortable.

Service was great! Everyone was friendly and any requests were addressed in minutes. Furniture was scratched and dented and I took pictures upon check in to avoid being held responsible upon checkout. City view wasnt anything to write home about and the hallways smelled a bit musty. Lobby is much nicer than hallways. The bellhops were readily available to offer help and assistance and guidance with the area. At night the immediate area has some homeless people sleeping in corners outside.

The Starbucks downstairs was pretty handy to have downstairs, a great cafe was around the corner white dragon cafe. The highlight was being close to the China town night market.

There is also a charge for not returning the key cards peculiar. Door had a chain lock and key access was needed to access floor. The gen z bar was ok. This is my first time stay at this hotel. I stayed here for one night on Friday. The hotel located in a superb location and very convenient to reach to bus, taxi, boat taxi or MRT within less than 10mins walk. My room is on 19th floor very big and comfortable with lovely decorations and spectacular views from room. Staffs are very helpful and have service mind. A lot of parking spaces. Here they have cocktails bar on the 17th floor which I can enjoy variety of cocktails and pizza, I recommend their signature cocktails and smoked salmon pizza. The special one of this hotel is they have a restaurant on 25th floor which can moving around as circle, then you can see top view of Bangkok around from here. I really impressive with temple view, city view and river view. Moreover, if you would like to go to Chinatown and stop by to enjoy street foods at night or go to buy gifts or stuffs at wholesale market on weekends, this hotel is the perfect place to stay.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

However, it is a maze, and the signs for the correct elevators are way too confusing to figure out on one's own. There needs to be clearer signage so guests can get to rooms on higher floors without needing to ask employees for assistance. The hotel was very clean. The rooms are big and very comfortable. The staff were always super sweet, very kind and always ready to help. The breakfast is very delicious. They also had a restaurant that was yummy too. Swimming pool was clean and the water was at good temperature. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and will come back hopefully soon again. Thank you U Sathorn Hotel you were excellent! I really loved ohr stay there. Such a beautiful experience. This hotel is the most amazing hotel in Bangkok, an oasis in the city and I can really recommend. It is beautiful, beautiful pool, atmosphere and delicious breakfast. And on top of that all the staff is amazing! They are really professional and incredibly friendly and helpful. I had a very big problem with losing my bag in a Grab and was in a nightmare situation, but the lobby team was on it like a detective team, called all the organizations needed to track down the driver and found back my bag  an arranged a driver to bring it back to me!! How they handled this was so amazing and I am so so grateful.
This was already our second time staying here and we will be definitely back next time.
Highly recommended! I booked a room through Agoda for 36 October. However, one room was not fully booked and the other was booked for the wrong date. I realized this mistake when I arrived at the hotel and panicked. However, thanks to the reception manager, Tanapon Sansamut, I was offered a new room and was assigned right away. Most importantly, he explained in detail how to contact Agoda and get help, and I was able to cancel my previous wrong reservation. Tanapon Sansamut is very responsible and has great customer service. If I come back to Bangkok and find this hotel again, it will be because of Tanapon Sansamut. He is the nicest hotel staff I have ever met. Thank you for the great experience in Bangkok. The hotel is old, but it has a swimming pool and you can enjoy the vacation spot near Bangkok's city center. Also, the staff is very friendly. There was an accident, but we were able to solve it smoothly with the help of P at the front desk. I will come back when I have another opportunity. Thank you.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Very affordable. Nice rooftop pool, sun bathing and bar. Good rooms. There was a gym on my floor. Nice staff at reception. Rooms are cozy with hot water shower. Air conditioning works great. Great location in China Town. Cant go wrong xxx The location is in the middle of Chinatown. Outside it is busy with life and food, but inside the room it was very quiet and easy to sleep. The staff were very kind and helpful when we had questions. The bed was firm and one of the best mattresses we have had at hotels. We slept very well.
The tub in the bathroom was a dropin style, which resulted in a little water coming out during showers. However, the floor was properly sloped so the water ran to the drain and did not create a hazard in the bathroom.
We look forward to staying here again. Beautiful and clean room, spacious and super clean both room and  bathroom, very cool refrigirator and AC, microwave work very well, and the best part was water run from shower  and bathtub on 10th can be super FAST,  never seen bathtub that can be fully with water just in 10 minutes. AMAZING.... the Breakfast for vegetarian was ALWAYS made me no appetite and bad mood, stay for 6 nights but this hotel CAN'T even make egg omelette as my request,  omelette only 1 yolk WITH 2 white egg, coz my mom had cholesterol and vegetarian only the first breakfast they made it right, the rest of my BF was pissed me off.. Rooms are fine. Can feel dimly lit at times but it's OK if.you don't plan to spend much time there. Awesome rooftop pool that overlooks bangkok. Walk straight out the door into everything you need. Great street food Chinatown is a chaotic place with buzzing shops and overcrowded customers. However this hotel is pure serenity. Its like meditating peacefully amidst a fierce battlefield. The rooms were superb spacious and the shower is a refreshing waterfall at our custom temperature. The price is extremely competitive and has accessibility to almost everything in Bangkok.

The hotel is great. The room is clean and comfortable. Pretty standard

What makes this hotel truly stands out, lies in their amazing hospitality. Their staff, every single one of them, are friendly and always greet me with a smiling face.The staff who led me to my room after checking in did so well in explaining the amenities in the room and services the hotel has to offer.

We had a fantastic time with the excellent service provided at the Anju restaurant. She has a great memory, remembering the table I preferred during my first time of stay . Her superbly service and sincerity made me feel so welcomed. First time staying at this property and a wonderful experience. Staff is extra attentive. Property is quite new so rooms are amazing. Slightly cramped bathrooms but still manageable. Breakfast is one of the best. Plenty of options and can order fresh custom items aswell.
Popsicle Emergency is a really cool feature, which kids love. Air purifier in the room was a very elegant touch. An in house 7 Eleven was very convenient. I travel to bkk every year and I can easily say that this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The hotel is really busy and yet they did not slip in their service standards. You can tell that a hotel prioritizes service when all their staff are welltrained and well mannered when attending to guests.

The breakfast was excellent, the best I have eaten, with a good variety, providing healthy and hearty options. I particularly loved that there were freshly made pressed juices and the mulberry juice was absolutely delightful. The menu varies everyday and my favourite was the stir fried pork with gochujang sauce.

I stayed in the twin room and it was spacious and comfortable.

Would definitely return and I hope they keep up their good service standards. I recently stayed at Sindhorn Midtown, and I have to say that my experience was absolutely fantastic! The hotel itself is beautiful, with clean and comfortable rooms, great amenities, and a welcoming atmosphere, and we got our room upgraded.

What really stood out to me, though, was the exceptional service I received from Naphat. From the moment I checked in, he went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect.

The location by the canal sounds nice. BUT please keep in mind that the noise from the canal is no joke. You hardly sleep quitely from the boat ride very late at night and very early in the morning.
The reception staff was ok. They tried to help what they could, but I think they were short of staff, see only a couple of people running the place.
In short nothing impressive, not a relaxing stay, and the food not a worth bib gourmet.. no need to come and try anything.
Ps. We paid more expensive than the current price because we moved the booking from late April to late July. I paid 12xxx baht, but at the reception desk, I saw it reduced to 8xxx baht now. Make sure you got a bargain if after reading my review and you still want to try. The hotel itself is nice and the room is nice but the location is terrible and the area stinks unbelievably bad. I had booked the hotel for two nights but after the first night I had to book somewhere else and leave.

The room I stayed in had a view to the canal whilst I was sleeping you could literally hear everything going on in the hotel and I hardly slept and neither did my wife.

There's a small single track not even wide enough for a car to get to and from the hotel and it's a 510 min walk to get a taxi and there's 0 shops around.

The location is basically in the slums of Bangkok and it's not a nice place to be in. I would recommend anyone to think twice. A fantastic hidden gem of a hotel. The location is right at the mouth of Bangkok Noi Canal where it pours into the Chaopraya River

Arriving by car will require you to take a 200300 meter walk from the drop off point thru a community to reach the hotel. Once you have reached the place, you will find yourself amidst such a cosy little place.

The hotels main cafe is listed on the Michelin Guide and has been there for a few years. They serve not only drinks, but also very good meals. Our group has a set lunch which was scrumptious. The main dish was confit duck in masman sauce with mashed potatoes and carrots. The dessert was also fantastic Paid a visit yesterday for a coffee. This place is stunning. It has beautiful accomodation, great restaurant and fantastic cafe. Located on the Chou Praya rover bank. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Will definately go back asap. Lovely hotel by the river.
The room is so comfortable, bed is super comfy!!
Love the view from my room!! Its great to wake up with river view.
The restaurant offer great set menu for dinner and breakfast is good.

The only downside is the entrance is really a hidden path!! If you bring your car, you need to park at the temple and walk about 200m through small alley to this hotel. But it worth the effort!!",no operation time,"cafe, lodging, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment"
Maitria Hotel Sukhumvit 18 – A Chatrium Collection,"26 Soi Sukhumvit 18, Khwaeng Khlong Tan, Khet Khlong Toei, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand",4.4,13.7328872,100.5625923,"On this trip we stayed in 2 hotels, and this was the 2nd. It's location is not bad, near a main street, a 711 convenience on the corner, restaurants you can walk to and some street shopping.  The service is good and we had no trouble getting picked up and dropped off from it. There is a nice gym and rooftop pool, and the restaurant has a variety menu and the food we had there was very good. Our room happened to be a corner suite booking so we had lots of room and a kitchenette. I was most excited that there was an inroom washerdryer combo. They offer laundry in the basement level that you can buy tokens for at the front desk, but our room came with a washer. Water and coke in the fridge everyday. Overall, a very comfortable stay. Pros The alley of this hotel is a whole lot better than some other parts around Sukhumvit in my experience, it's well lit and fairly clean, sidewalks are clear.
The hotel lobby is connected to The Coffee Club, breakfast is from there. Our hotel room was simple, clean and clutterfree.
The bathroom was big, water pressure was pretty strong. Hot and cold water worked great, especially hot water could last a good while.
Staff service, cleanliness, surrounding and location are 1010.

Cons
1 the mattress was pretty hard, firmer than a normal firm bed, there was a little bump on the surface so it kinda hurt my knee when laying on one side 
2 the AC is strong ONLY on ""Dry"" mode, it's extremely cold for the bed but that's the only option for us to feel comfortable. On ""Cool"" mode, the AC only blows very humid air, it may need cleaning.

We may go back to Maitria because of the location and the ambiance of the alley. Very close to the walking bridge that'd take you across the busy crossroad to Terminal 21. I stayed there for 2 nights. A great hospitality from the staff Katib, Bow, Noon and Johnny.

The location is very good. I booked a standard suite room with a kitchen. Did not use any of the facilities given in the kitchen as we were out most of the time. But the room was clean and tidy

The Buffet breakfast was good. I had a good stay here. Nice hotel, about a five minute walk without bags from SukhumvitAsok station. Check in was quick and efficient, no deposit which was nice to avoid withdrawing more cash than Id need, one of only a handful of hotels Ive been to that actually provide the promised room upgrade for Expedia gold members.
Suite was large and clean, with a kitchen and complimentary nonalcoholic minibar. Bed comfortable, room quiet.
Breakfast was average, with eggs cooked to order and otherwise the standard buffet assortment.
Wifi very slow, otherwise would be suitable for long stays.
Rooftop pool not as pleasant as other properties in the area with no real view, didnt spend much time there and only saw one other person using it as an exercise area. Accessible only by stairs. Good location for exploring Bangkok. Attentive staff. Clean modern rooms.. Great roof top pool. Restaurant was nice with great selection of foods to cater for all tastes..",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Metro Hotel,"326, 20-22 Thanon Rama IV, Mahapreuttaram, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand",4.8,13.7372414,100.5170314,"While the room is quite small and the furnishings arent particularly good, the staff made up for it with their good service. They allowed us to check in early at no extra cost. The hotels location is also convenient for walking to China Town, and its right next to the MRT station, making it easy to go to other places The room I was in was tiny, the bed was small, had a big dip in the middle, and was fixed on wheels which meant whenever I shifted, the entire bed moved slightly as well. Bathroom was not good, but not terrible. Quality of paint and tiles were shabby in general.

The best thing about it was the location, which is a few seconds away from MRT, as well as within a minute or two of laundromat and 711. A few minutes away by grab is Yaowarat. The area around the hotel is walkable, but not worth walking around.

Overall the value for money was somewhat acceptable, even moreso if you don't care about the quality of your room. Price is reasonable in this area. Near MRT and bus stop. Near 711. The staff is friendly. However, no toothbrush and weak wifi. So close with MRT station, easier to go everywhere. The toiletries complete enought but no toothbrush and toothpaste isnt available so u need to buy at 7eleven near the hotel The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. We were able to keep our bags there after check out while we waited to go to the train station.
The sheets were clean. Bed quite hard as per the usual in Asia. Towels could have been cleaner. Mould in the shower should be cleaned. Nice to have a balcony. Some hallway noise, but that is expected in any hotel. Close to MRT and railway station is a PLUS. Check out the Cozy Massage place next door if you need a good rub down.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Paying to have breakfast included is more than worth it  you get to chose a yummy dish from their breakfast menu and fill up on fruit and snacks at the buffet. We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood on foot, but being 3 min walking from the BTS station is great to be connected to the rest of the city too. The staff were always super kind to us, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. A bit small, but we were only there to sleep at night so worked fine for us. We loved it. Wonderful hotel! Good scent the moment enter the hotel! The hotel is very close to the Saint Louis BTS station, about a 3 minutes walk and there is 711 across the street from the BTS station. Staffs are all very friendly and helpful. The room was very big and clean. Highly recommended!! Stepping into ASAI Bangkok Sathorn felt like a trip down memory lane to my childhood Thai homecozy vibes included. The unique decor warms the heart and makes the notsospacious rooms feel surprisingly roomy. Breakfast is a treat with fresh juice every morning in a comfy area thats just the right size.

Fitness buffs, youre in for a treat! The hotel boasts a worldclass gym equipped with topnotch amenities like Matrix treadmills. Locationwise, its spotonjust a hop, skip, and a jump from the Saint Louis BTS station and surrounded by delicious eateries. The only tiny hiccup? The ceilings are a bit on the low sidetall folks, mind your heads! All in all, a charming spot that blends nostalgia with modern comforts. It proved to be a charming and convenient choice for my stay. The cozy little space was perfect to unwind in the urban landscape. Its proximity to the metro station was a major plus, making it easy to explore the city Location is very in the middle of bangkok, convineient 6mins walk to saint louis train station.

Everything in the room was present. The room was clean and bing and had all the facilities in a very affordable price. I would definitely recommend this Hotel Excellent budget hotel! The rooms are a little dated, but very clean and spacious. The WiFi worked well enough for video calls.  The staff friendly and check in seamless. It's about 10 mins walk from Sutthisan MRT station from where you can take MRT to Airport Rail Makasan, Asok or further to Chinatown etc. There is a market on the way from MRT to the hotel where you have a lot of street food selection and no tourists so you get local experience. The market closes quite early though, around 830pm, as it mostly seem to cater to office workers around. We stayed at this hotel and it was a pleasant stay. The rooms are very good, spacious, clean and comfortable. They have a king size bed and one small bed or bed of kids or can say a sofa for sitting and putting your items over there.
The washroom is also very clean and has 24 hour water facilities. From the room window, you can see the big buildings of Bangkok any time.
The staff is very helpful, Miss Pat and Miss Eye helped us in finding the right local train and bus to reach the Chao Paya River.
They have water dispenser as well, so if you need hot water, cold water or warm water, you can take it from there. Although they provide you water bottles in the room and electric kettle but still if you need more water, use a dispenser.
The location is very good and it is very close to the Suttishan MRT. Easily you can take a Grab or Bolt ride as well as a local bus  train ride.
The more appropriate location is the Meung Thai Life Insurance building and near Cafe Amazon.
Best way to reach 
Take the train from the Airport, reach Makkasan, then move to the MRT station using over bridge, take a train to Suttishan and then walk and reach Restratchada.
My recommendation  if you need budgeted hotel, I would say RestRatchada Hotel. I stayed 2 days quiet place at night which I really liked
the staff behind the desk are great
which even made it better place to stay
good place to stay at a very reasonable price Service is good , but have many Muslim, very dangerous, afraid","Monday: Open 24 hours

We were upgraded to one of the Club rooms which was huge, with big bathtub with very nice views of the city which after a long flight from Japan was a plus. The staff were really friendly. The location is close to a street food street where we could have something to eat even after arriving quite late at night and well connected with public transport with other main tourist spots and airport.We would recommend this hotel if visiting Bangkok. The room was clean and comfortable, with a nice 120degree view of the cityscape.

Service was impeccable and the staff really go the extra mile to please you.

Location is good, with nice restaurants in the vicinity. If not for the occasional terrible traffic jams in Bangkok! Staff very friendly and helpful. Location good as most popular destinations are a short taxi journey. Room very clean and service was great  especially June, Cream and Sandy who were very welcoming throughout our stay. Would recommend The hotel is lovely, but what really makes it special is the amazing staff, especially Champ and June. They made my stay so welcoming and enjoyable. I highly recommend Amara Hotel for anyone looking for a friendly and unforgettable experience. Ill definitely be coming back! I had an amazing time at the Amara Hotel in Bangkok! The staff was extremely polite, helpful, and nice. Even tho I checked in as a backpacker, they didn't treat me any different from the other guests. The rooms are big, clean and have an amazing view!!

I was surprised to learn it's only been in operation a couple of years.  However, it gives off 5 star energy.
My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights and had ZERO issues with the staff or its facilities.
But here's my suggestions
1.  You can't charge the room if you want bar or food service like other hotels.
2.  I wish the concierge had better travel options for tours.
3.  While the shuttle boat was terrific, I wish the shuttle van service was available all week long and to more locations and for pick up, not just drop off.
4.  The pool... I wish it didn't look like I was swimming in a fountain, lol.

Still, my wife and I were very happy with this place and will most likely return with our kids.

I highly recommend this place to anyone seeking worldclass treatment at affordable prices. Mint, she is awesome who works over time to provide a spectacular Thai Dress photo experience.  We had such a great time and she is very patient and pleasant during the whole process. From beginning of putting on the dresses and walked us out to pool and river side for perfect backdrop. We took so many great pictures. Complementary service from hotel has never been so excellent.  I love it. Lacking 5star details!

Checkin they failed to inform about a 30minute complimentary foot massage, luckily I went to the spa a day before my appointment when they informed me of this.

Room generally ok, clean, bright...but slightly paranoid throughout the stay of having my curtains completely open, rooms across  can look into each others rooms, bathroom too. The basin was very small, hardly any space to store your toiletries, the cabinet door below, nothing there  just a hollow space. Toilet seat, seemed very small, not your average size. Shower floor extremely slippery, that's got to be fixed!

Service for a 5star hotel in Bangkok and having stayed at many of the bigger 5stars, the level of English was pretty poor, had to repeat myself several times to many staff  even asking basic things. Getting a towel by the pool, then get asked for your room number, fine  I got back 30 seconds later for an extra towel, get asked for room number AGAIN and name...
I asked for a glass of ros and someone comes over with a menu. I ask for a sparkling water and someone comes over with a menu  all seems a bit ""difficult"". Several staff do not know the property  again lack of English, but asking basic directions to certain restaurants for example seemed to be difficult and had to ask 3x different staff, not acceptable.

Mobile App several technical issues throughout stay and although communication through app was generally efficient, I was addressed as Mr.  you have my record, you know I'm not a Mr. Again, details.

Room service somewhat disappointing offer  so many menus across the property, but small selection for room service only. Also, why no breakfast room service available? Pretty standard for a 5star hotel.

Pool DJ in afternoon...don't have a DJ play and then leave the background music on  speakers behind the loungers poolside. Listening to 2 different types of music is very annoying. I had to mention this to staff to fix.

Spa THE highlight of this hotel, superb! Soundproof rooms, great massages and facials, excellent service and friendly.

Overall If you're looking to pay a little less for a 5star and don't mind certain details lacking then this is a great spot. Based on this visit, I will not return here. very good place to rest. they have very good facilities, the design of the hotel and the room is very eye pleasing. the breakfast provided is quite good but it is a bit unfortunate that there are not many choices of original Thai food. very good for a family vacation.

special shoutout to the staff named Bew. She is very kind and accommodating. from checking in to helping to provide a special free photo experience in traditional Thai clothes. even with a sudden request she is happy to help and take good photos! She also helped when we left our room cards in the room.

we will definitely come back when we travel to Thailand again. I'd like to highlight some of their services. The Thai Dress photoshoot. The lady was super nice! I gave her 10 out of 10.

Their boat service is also benefit to those planing to go to some touristy spots.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
"Mandarin Hotel Bangkok, managed by Centre Point","662 Thanon Rama IV, Khwaeng Maha Phruttharam, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand",4.4,13.7331487,100.5271586,"Rooms clean and comfortable. The service staff were conscientious about cleaning the room daily.
Service beyond expectation. We did not have an electrical converter and called the concierge. A service staff brought 2 to our room within 5 minutes.
Food The breakfast buffet boasted a huge spread. And there were daily variations to the food in the buffet, something we do not find in some hotels in South East Asia.
Convenience The hotel was right opposite a mall, which made shopping and food extremely convenient. There are 2 convenience stores on the left of the hotel as well as a Starbucks. So good! We originally booked another hotel turned out to be more of a hostel but wasn't in a location we liked, so we were able to book the Mandarin last minute for 3 nights at a very good price late Sept. Rainy season and moved. Wonderful, beautiful upscale hotel. Great service, location on a main street with restaurants and shopping to walk to. Porters for luggage and transportation help, great breakfast buffet for anyone's choices. My only issue was the hair dryer. You have to hold down the power button the whole time using it I'm sure it's a safety feature and on high temp it quits after a minute of use. I would recommend and stay here again if the opportunity arises. Enjoyed and loved our stay in this hotel. The hotel has great service and is spacious inside. The rooms are a little bit outdated but it gets the job done. The beds are comfortable. There is a premium Lets Relax Spa in the lobby of this hotel which is great if you need to relax after a long day of shopping. The hotel has one way service also to certain areas and attractions Overall extremely nice. Disliked being charged for ice! You feel clean as the maid service was great. Location to the MRT train was fantastic. Close to two malls for any items you need, minutes walk away. I recommend this hotel with a solid 4.5 to 4.7 rate out of 5. We have arrived to Bangkok for one night stay connection flights
We decided to stay in the central of the city.
We chose location and Mandarin was the right place,
We chose quality and Mandarin Did Not disappoint  us,
We chose Mandarin from our experience in hotels around the globes and not around the price.
We were delighted with the service the minute we have arrived to the hotel.
Staff are very professional and polite.
Front desk assist us the seconds we arrived to the desk,
Our room was ready to go in 2 hours before we were due1400 it was a big plus since we only had only 24 hours in the capital.
Room 949 was very clean and refreshing after a long flight.
The following day we were told that we can check out later then usual which was helpful however we wanted to check early do we could take a tour of the town.
We would like to thank the call Concierge staff the lady in the front desk and everyone else who was eager to assist.
Free shuttle to the Siam Paragon was great curtsy of the hotel.
And since it was a low season we got our room for fraction of the price. Highly recommend 1010",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

However the lobby hall looks outdated . Consider renovating it with modern design to create a fresh atmosphere and enhance  the  guest experience, making them feel proud to stay at the hotel. Bangkok City Inn is all about location. Situated near CentralWorld and Pratunam Market, its perfect for shopping enthusiasts. However, the hotel itself is quite average. The rooms are basic and a bit dated, offering just the essentials. The service is fine, but nothing exceptional. If youre looking for a nofrills, budgetfriendly place to crash after a day of exploring, it does the job. But dont expect luxury or modern amenities. Overall, its a decent choice if location is your top priority. 3 stars. Good location. Hot shower is good. Thought there's a bathtub. Breakfast was OK for the price. Good location but nearby was a bit dodgy massage place. Its just a old hotel around the area which is super convenient for people like to shopping around Platinum and Pratunam DayNight market. However, the rooms are not very clean as we found some tiny cockroaches coming out of nowhere. Other than that, hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. With tight budget, this hotel will suit ones needs if you dont mind some shortcomings in cleanliness. Good to stay.

The hotel has a charming, oldschool feel, yet its impeccably maintained. The rooms are generously sized, making for a comfortable and relaxing stay. Despite the presence of a nightclub on the lobby level, the soundproofing is excellentyou cant hear a thing from the rooms.

The hotel is located on a lovely street lined with several charming cafes, and its just a stones throw from the malls, making it a perfect spot for both relaxation and shopping. The staff at the Davis are incredibly friendly and always ready to help, which adds to the warm atmosphere. One of our favorite features is the rooftop pool, which is both charming and full of character. Its the perfect spot to unwind. We look forward to our next stay at this lovely hotel. Highly recommended! Very bad service. My friend in Vietnam forgot her airpod while she stayed here a few days.

But the hotel wasn't having a service to store  keep it safe. I ended up back and forth to ask for my friend airpod. The first time I was here, they said that it's too late and had to come next time, not mention about making appointment. The second time I was here, they said why I didn't make appointment. It took me 40' to wait and the receptionist kept telling me to wait for what and don't lemme know the ETA?

 If you have a good system to store things, this issue will not happen.
 On top of it, they didn't agree to support to send the airpod home.

Very shady and not trustworthy. It is a nice hotel with a busy architecture from an old building. It made finding my room an adventure. It was a busy hotel but the park where it is located has a good atmosphere. The breakfast was a typical buffet which didnt impress me and the bar at night was quite busy and a bit pretentious.  Staff attending the bar not very friendly either, but by contrast the recepcionista were quite nice and went out of their way to help The receptionist at the hotel is very rude and treated the customers that we cant afford the rooms. Give us annoyed face when we asked the questions about breakfast. She replied all the questions we asked in a very rude way. I talked to the manager and she said sorry only. The hotel should give the better training to the staffs. Me and my family are in Thailand for vacation and it doesnt deserve the money to stay at Davis Hotel. We got annoyed and terrible experience while we are here because of what happened. The hotel doesnt even take the proper action about how their staffs are treating to their customers. Really terrible service!!!! The toilet, shower room and drainage are terrible, which is hard to believe for a 4star hotel. I was worried it would overflow. I stayed there for 2 weeks and it was dusty and not well cleaned. There was always something forgotten, like toilet paper or a bath mat. The only good thing was that there was a cheap and delicious Peking duck restaurant nearby.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Retro39 - Hotel in Bangkok,"1, PHJC+86W, 10 Soi Sukhumvit 39, Khwaeng Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand",3.6,13.7308149,100.5705184," SCAM WARNING  Retro39 and its employees are a disgrace to Thai culture and buddhist tradition

As a longterm expatriate residing in Thailand for over five years, I have come to love and respect the rich culture and warm hospitality that this country offers. However, my recent encounter with Retro39 has drastically tainted this image, showcasing a level of fraudulence and unethical behavior I've never experienced before in Thailand.

I initially booked a 9night stay at Retro39, drawn by their seemingly appealing facilities and location. However, due to unforeseen changes in my schedule, I needed to modify my reservation. This is where the nightmare began. Despite the hotel appearing mostly vacant, the staff refused to accommodate any changes to my booking. In an attempt to resolve the issue, I cancelled my reservation with the intention of rebooking. Shockingly, once I cancelled, they barred any rebooking options, refused to undo the cancellation, and, most astoundingly, retained the full 400 payment without providing any services or a room.

So to summarize  I was charged for 9 nights, and then after cancelling and trying to rebook, they decided not to give me anything, they didn't want to give me any nights, or none of the money back, so I was left without a room AND without the money.

After talking with Booking.com about this which they agreed was completely outrageous, they said they have nothing they can do, and I need to work directly with the property.

Faced with this blatant scam, I reached out to various avenues for help, including the local police and the Thai embassy, both of which have now initiated a thorough investigation into the property. My suspicions about the hotel's integrity deepened given the presence of a drug store within the building's premises, hinting at potentially more sinister undertakings possibly even linked to criminal activities.

The unprofessionalism didn't stop at just their booking policies. The staff's behavior was juvenile and dismissive throughout the ordeal. They demonstrated a complete lack of empathy and professional conduct, which is not only disappointing but alarming, considering they are part of an industry that significantly contributes to the countrys image and economy.

This establishments fraudulent practices seem to be a recurring theme, as evident from numerous similar complaints by other guests. These include unauthorized charges, refusal to issue refunds, and a general lack of accountability. Their responses to online reviews are superficially polite, yet consistently deceptive, further indicating their manipulative tactics.

To potential visitors, I strongly recommend steering clear of Retro39. The risk of falling prey to their scams far outweighs any potential benefits of a stay. This hotel is a disgrace not only to Thai hospitality but also to the peaceful and ethical principles of Buddhist culture that Thailand is renowned for. Their actions reflect a deepseated greed and moral bankruptcy that should prompt serious introspection among the management and staff.

As a parting note, I've attached screenshots of my conversations with the property, which serve as indisputable evidence of their deceptive practices. Let my unfortunate experience serve as a cautionary tale to all. It is disheartening to see such an establishment operate, and I sincerely hope that justice through legal and social avenues will soon put an end to their unscrupulous operations. Thankfully, karma has a way of addressing such gross misconduct.

BEWARE OF HARRY AND THE THAI GIRL THAT WORKS IN THE PROPERTY  I pray they will make peace with god, and understand that the path they are taking goes against Thai and Buddhist culture

EDIT As per the business responses  I added proof of their 400 charge on my card and removed an image of their employee  their response at the end can prove to you that they and cannot take valid critizism, and automatically resort to the fact that its ""defamation"" and ""hate speech"" shows you what type of business they really are. If you want a no frills hotel in the heart of Sukhumvit at a cheap price this is the best choice!

This hotel basically functions as a place to sleep and not much more. Rooms were clean. Location was actually pretty quiet considering how much is around it. Hotel staff were friendly. 2 minute walk from BTS station, shopping malls, and tons of street food vendors.

Some cons Bed was very firm I like firm beds, but this was too firm. Has AC but it can struggle to keep up during summer.

Highly recommend if you want to be in the thick of things on the cheap. Noise 24 hours, old dirty towels and bedding, hard bed. Nothing worth , only good thing is its near  Emporium
No lobby, never allowed you to check in before 200 pm A very basic hotel at a super convenient location. Room is simple but nice. Hot water is good. Great location to start ur exploration in bkk. Do note, there's a Cannabis store right infront of the hotel, so it not a ideal location for family with kids. In this hotel, there are only two pros 1 its proximity to the metro and a very good shopping center, and 2 initially, the cleanliness is perfect. However, during the three days of our stay, the room was not cleaned at all. One of the drawbacks is its location on a very noisy street. Even in the deep night, there is no silence here. The noise from the hotel neighbors is also perfectly audible. Opening the window is impossible because locals barbecue meat all day below, and the smell goes straight into the rooms. Consequently, there is no fresh air either.

Upon checkin, they take a deposit of 1000 baht. When checking out to retrieve the deposit, the hotel staff goes to check your room to ensure you haven't stolen their kettle, towel, or anything else. This entire procedure takes a lot of time, so keep that in mind when checking out. Frankly, we encountered such nonsense for the first time.

But in this area, it's difficult to find a clean hotel with a window at a reasonable price. So, I can still recommend staying here. However, if the location is not crucial for you, by moving 1015 minutes into the depths of Bangkok away from the center, you can find a much better hotel for the same money, with breakfast included, or even cheaper.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Prom Ratchada Hotel,"558 Thanon Ratchadaphisek, Khwaeng Din Daeng, Khet Din Daeng, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10400, Thailand",4.1,13.7699644,100.5705535,"I'm rating this hotel at 2.5 stars. Be aware that the hotel has three separate buildings and the one I stayed in was older and did not look like the pics. It was more in line with a 2 star hotel. The breakfast was OK but did not change with the same dishes served daily.  Some fruit items would have been welcomed. I stayed here on the last night of my stay in Thailand , the room was lovely although I feel there should have been bedside tables , whilst there is a table with 2 chairs you need something at both sides of the bed not just one option in my opinion, especially when the price is slightly more than hotels of equal quality in the same area.
There is be a pool that I didnt use and I did not have the breakfast due to a need to get to the airport for my flight home, both the pool and breakfast offerings looked good and the hotel was busy.
Because the hotel was busy this highlighted to myself the lack of soundproofing in the rooms and getting to sleep was quite difficult due to noise , the toilet was also very low , it felt like it should have been for a child .
In summary it is a lovely clean hotel check in and check out was smooth , I wont be staying here again because of the noise and better value hotel I stayed in on my arrival to BKK which is just down the rd . Checkin was ok. I left my Oakley glasses at the pool, and they said they did not have them. Once my thai friend talked to them, my glasses were at the front desk. That's shady, to say the least. Then the front desk called for me to checkout, I said yes I'm checking out at noon, he kept saying don't be late, don't be late we charge you for one hour if you late. I had 25 min. I know noon is checkout time as i kept repeating to him. They wanted me out right then. I've been to so many different countries, including Thailand, many times.No recommending this property. I was living at different hotels around this area for quite some time, this is my first time exploring the back area of the shopping mall! Can't help but to mention this hotel with its cleanlinessbed sheets and towels is such a bargain 1400night including breakfast I will definitely come back again

1F has a cozy swimming pool
Breakfast serve at 2F6301030

Sindhorn Kempinski Hotel Bangkok,"80 Soi Ton Son, Khwaeng Lumphini, Pathum Wan, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10330, Thailand",4.7,13.7367277,100.5439428,"Experienced with all five senses that you are in Thailand. Friendly staff, nice design, good food. The garden is stunning, the ambiance is calming. The dessert was the most impressive. I felt a little rushed as I visited close to closing time but it was enough to enjoy it. My favorite hotel in bangkok i love everything in it. Location, service, staff, all room types and facilities. Perfect choice for families, couples or groups.  This time i booked the grand deluxe room and it was amazing. Also i enjoyed the spa, gym and pilates classes. Moreover, the afternoon experience is not to me missed Super extremely happy with my stay! The rooms, facilities, breakfast, everything was perfect. The only negative aspect of the hotel was the swimming pool. It was a bit small with slippery floors, so I wouldn't say that it's so kids friendly. It's also on the 9th floor between floors, not completely outdoors, meaning that there is a roof over the pool with a small portion that protudes out a bit. This makes it possible to use the pool even when the weather is not nice, but as someone who enjoys swimming under open skies, this was a bit disappointing. However, the staff working at the pool were simply amazing. The way they cleaned the areathe sunbeds and the floor and catered to your needs, we're way above my expectations and though I failed to catch they names, I want to personally thank them for their quality service. The staff at the lobby as well as all common areas were also of the highest quality, being extremely friendly, kind, and helpful. The room was impressive with lots of convenient features, such as automatic curtains, lots of USB type A charging ports, and was very very clean and comfortable with high ceilings. The breakfast was also one of the best. Lots of variety and they were all very good quality. Any eggbacon menu can be made by order and they always had fresh coconut and mango sticky rice. They also had Jamon, prosciutto, smoke salmon everyday, as well as Thai, Indian, Mediterranean cuisines. Location is also amazing with the Velaa right next door, where you can find lots of great restaurantsCo Limited, El Gaucho, Cloud Dragon, et. and the hotel also provides shuttle service to nearby BTS stations. The showers in the common areamy flight was at night and took a shower after check out, before heading to the airport was also very very nice. It was very clean and looked like it was maintained at the highest quality. The fact that their check out time is noon was also nice as this gave us more time to get ready and this always is difficult with 3 kids. Staying with kids was a pleasant experience with special welcome backpacks filled with snacks as well as toiletries and bathrobesslippers for kids as well. You can really tell that they care for their guests and want to make sure that you are comfortable. All in all, I can confidently say that this is one of the best hotels I stayed at, if you take the swimming pool out of the picture. My husband and I had an amazing and peaceful getaway at Sindhorn Kempinski Hotel Bangkok. Our suite room were modern, very spacious, and filled with thoughtful touches. One of the best parts was that the staff were extremely kindprofessional and constantly refilled all amenities without needing to ask, made us feel truly cared for.
I especially enjoyed the afternoon tea and dining experience where everything was soo delicious. Overall, it was an excellent choice for our relaxing stay, and we plan to return with our children again next time. Absolutely unparalleled experience!!! Hotel is simply stunning, staff is amazing and food is incredible. Centrally located with easy access to all the sights and shopping malls. Having stayed in other luxury hotel chains I can honestly say this hotel is absolutely the best in my personal experience!!!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Mövenpick Hotel Sukhumvit 15 Bangkok,"47 Sukhumvit 15, Khwaeng Khlong Toei Nuea, Watthana, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand",4.3,13.7422418,100.5584417,"It was a decent experience, but the breakfast was pretty chaotic as the hotel seemed pretty full with hardly any tables left. The variety of the breakfast was good, but they seemed unable to handle so many guests, and it quickly got empty.

The service was great though. My family and I enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Movenpick Hotel. The property is aesthetically designed and wellmaintained. The hotel features luxurious interiors that exude sophistication.

However, I was somewhat disappointed that, despite traveling a considerable distance with my twoyearold infant, my executive suite was not ready until 4 PM, which is two hours later than the designated checkin time. This left a bad taste to start with. Whilst I am an Accor Plus member, there wasn't any effort made to meet and greet me or even offer me the welcome drink. We highly recommend this hotel due to its proximity to various amenities such as massage parlors, bars, and markets. It is an ideal choice for travelers seeking a convenient and comfortable stay in Bangkok. The breakfast provided by the hotel is comprehensive and of high quality, catering to a wide range of preferences. The hotel's services are commendable. and we anticipate returning for future stays. We had an excellent experience with Movenpick hotel! They catered for everything we wanted or needed without hesitation. Chang went over and above catering for all our needs. The location was in the centre of all the action with a short walk to both the BTS and MRT making it easy to get around Bangkok. The breakfast was amazing and had an assortment for all cuisines. The room was spotless, bed was comfortable and shower had excellent pressure. Highly recommended. ""Outstanding hotel with exceptional service. The staff was superb, offering warm and attentive hospitality. A special mention to Dean, Sui, Few, and the entire team for their invaluable assistance throughout our stay. We sincerely appreciate your efforts. The buffet was also delightful, with a wide selection of delicious options. Thank you all for making our experience so memorable.""",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean, the amenities are plentiful, the food is superb, and the prices are affordable.

I booked on Agoda. The price was 1000 baht for a king room. I upgraded to get the 2 breakfasts to 1200 baht.  Definitely worth it, the breakfast is great! 

Very close to Chinatown, about a 4 minute walk.

Also about a 4 minute walk to the train station or the metro. 

Welcome drinks are flavorful too! And you can earn 2 more welcome drinks by saving the sheets see the photos 

I definitely recommend this hotel. Amazing hotel located right by the main train station. Staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. The Breakfast is a buffet style for an additional 250THB which was amazing and had great selection. We will definitely be returning the next time we are in Bangkok! We had a positive experience m, staying at the Quarter. It was a 500 bhat taxi from the airport about a 35min ride. The hotel is in a good location to be able to walk around Bangkok and explore many fun areas. The staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay. The internet worked well. The breakfast buffet included was great, with lots of both familiar and local options. Our room had a nice view from the window, a comfy mattress not a thaistyle one!, and a reasonably priced minibar with drinksnacks and room service menu, should you wish to partake. Everything was clean, as well. Thanks for a great stay! Danny and Billy work for your company inside the hotel. They will take you where you need to go for a good price, and they are very nice. Hotel is clean and staff is friendly. Convenient location, very short walk to MRT. Beds are quite firm and hard I chose this place during my recent stay in Bangkok for 4 nights. Had a very nice experience staying here.

We reached Bangkok in the morning after an overnight train journey from Nong Khai, so we were very tired. Upon requesting the reception staff, they were kind enough to accelerate the cleaning process and allowed us to check in more than 2 hours before our check in time.

Our room on the 11th floor had an amazing view of the city and its sprawling skyline. The room had all the necessary amenities, the bed was also very comfortable. However the bed headboard was a bit worn out, which kinda compromises the overall aesthetic of the room. My favourite part of this hotel was the skydeck, from where you can witness an amazing sunset.

Breakfast was served on the same floor as the reception 12th floor maybe. The breakfast was delicious, consisting of a varied spread of Asian and Western items. And they change their menu everyday so on all the four days we were treated to something new.

The location is the hotel's main USP. Its just a minute away from one of Bangkoks main attractions, Wat Traimit The Golden Buddha. The hotel is situated diagonally opposite the old railway station, and the Hualamphong MRT station on the Blue Line is only a minutes walk away, making it very convenient to travel across the city. Additionally, the heart of Bangkok's Chinatown is just a 5minute walk, offering a wide variety of food options. There are also at least four 711s nearby, adding to the convenience of the location.

At night the area becomes very quiet, which was good for me as I wanted to stay somewhere away from the noise and rush of Sukhumvit and Khao San.
Overall, a great place to stay.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Staff are kind and helpful. Very good value especially with the price we paid. The room is nice and good size. Nothing much around the hotel but its relaxing by a very large pool. 711 is about 10 minutes walk. Free shuttle service to and from the airport 24 hours.  Will definitely come back again. Locationwise, it is a big area with several buildings very spacious. It is a 30minutes drive from the airport, I liked that they have a free airport shuttle service. We were on a long transit period 3D2N and since the shuttle service was free, we took the airport shuttle to get to the airport link and back.
Rooms were spacious, the grounds of the hotel are very nice and the walkways were good. Their breakfast buffet had tasty food with a good range of options.

My only comment was smelling smoke stench in the rooms. It was quite overwhelming at times and I would get headaches so we had to open the window to air out the room. After the flight, this place felt like paradisejust a halfhour from the airport, and youre in a whole new world. The hotel grounds are huge, everything is super beautiful and clean. Im really bummed we didnt spend more time there I wish we couldve stayed at least a week. Its totally worth it.

The Praana spa is in its own building and feels like its own little world with amazing service.

The restaurant is open 24 hours, and the food is always great. Breakfast is in a different restaurant with a big buffet, and everything is super tasty.

The room was clean, and the beds were super comfy. We had such a good sleep and rest after the flight.

Highly recommend this hotelId give it 5 stars.

Big thanks to all the staff at the hotel! We wanted a place to spend the night before our flight back home, and this was a great choice. They have a shuttle to and from the airport. Great service, the room was spacious, quiet, and clean. The breakfast was delicious and full of options. Had a great 1 night stop over at this hotel. Rooms are spacious  and clean. Staff were very polite and helpful. There's a little shop in reception area that sold basics and gifts for a decent price.
Only thing I noticed is that outside some of the rooms when you look from the pool do look a bit dated","Monday: Open 24 hours

Mövenpick BDMS Wellness Resort Bangkok,"2 Thanon Witthayu, Khwaeng Lumphini, Pathum Wan, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10330, Thailand",4.5,13.7476509,100.547332,"Stayed there a week to attend conference organized on premises. Very nice hotel, attentive and very helpful staff, great rooms and pool area.
But there were one serious minus  after finishing workday, meetings and dinner, we wanted to sit with colleagues and chat  and lobby bar was closing at 1030pm, with no orders available after that and some days even lights were switched off.
Other thing   hotel not being able to order us taxi where we could pay with cards. Only option was hotel taxi with fixed cost which was couple times higher than normal. For customer focus I give 6 stars.
The strength of a hotel team is not in ideal conditions you can always find something you dont like, the main thing is to be able to make a guest happy if he is suddenly upset.

Believe me, they know how to work at this hotel.

I especially remember the pancakes made from healthy flour with cream and berries 

By the way, there is a very good shopping center nearby with a great Japanese restaurant. I will try to remember its name and add a description to my account. The hotel is well located but not in the busy part of the city.
Ideal for a get away resort kind of holiday yet close to the actions like shopping and dining!
All the staff are friendly and courteous to guests especially those at the breakfast dining and the evening cocktail. I couldnt name them all as all of them deserved the thumbs up. I am currently staying at your hotel in room 344 for ten nights while my mother receives treatment at Bangkok Hospital. I have been very pleased with the quality of the facilities and services, including the beautiful garden view, spacious bathroom, varied breakfast options, and excellent gym.

However, I experienced a concerning issue on the morning of August 21. An employee from the reception entered my room without prior notice or permission to remind me about a security deposit. This was unexpected and unsettling, especially considering the personal nature of the space. I spoke with Mr. Simon, the manager on duty, who seemed surprised by my reaction and subsequently checked me out of the room via the hotel app.

I appreciate Mr. Mac subsequent assistance in resolving the matter and his apology. Thank you Mac for your attention to this matter and for ensuring that such issues are addressed with staff.

I want to highlight that, as a Muslim, it is important for me and my family that our privacy and religious customs are respected, and such an incident was particularly sensitive.

Despite this issue, I genuinely enjoy staying at your hotel and would consider returning in the future. I had a good stay at Mvenpick BDMS, though finding the hotel and parking was a bit tricky at first. Checkin was smooth, and the staff were helpful. My upgraded room was comfortable but had a slight musty smell, and housekeeping was a bit slow. The club lounge staff were friendly but could be quicker. Breakfast was great with a good variety, and the food at Kham Hom was excellent. The shuttle to BTS could use more frequent trips during busy times. Overall, it was a pleasant stay with a few minor issues.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
SO/ Bangkok,"2 N Sathon Rd, Khwaeng Silom, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand",4.6,13.7262378,100.5431816,"The breakfast is excellent. From warm dishes to desserts, each item is carefully prepared, making it a delightful experience for all the senses.
I stayed in a room with a park view, and the view was fantastic. When I contacted the front desk about an issue with the room, they responded promptly, allowing me to have a comfortable and enjoyable vacation there. Excellent hotel. The breakfasts were amazing! A great variety of super fresh choices attractively displayed and deliciously prepared. The pool was also one of the nicest in city hotel pools Ive encountered it seems to be nearly 50 m long and was excellent for swimming laps plus plenty of chairs to sit poolside. The So Bangkok perfectly captures the essence of modern luxury with its stunning design and prime location in the heart of the city.

Here is a good comment
1. The room is beautiful with a great view, and there are photo spots everywhere.
2. There's plenty of parking, and EV charging stations are available for electric car users.
3. The breakfast offers a wide variety of delicious options, except for the Eggs Benedict, which needs significant improvement in taste.

Areas for Improvement
1. According to the schedule, I was supposed to check in at 300 PM, but I only received my room at 530 PM, without any compensation until I had to request a late checkout.
2. The communication between the email correspondence and the onsite staff did not match the agreedupon details regarding the room. However, the hotel did support upgrading the room, which was acceptable.
3. I used the hotels sauna service, but there was no water available in the sauna. When I asked the staff for assistance, they instructed me to fetch the water myself. I was quite shocked by the level of service provided by the hotel.

In the end, I was not impressed with the service at the hotel, even though the hotel itself is beautiful and the food is good. I hope the staff will not neglect customer care and that better training will be provided. SoBangkok is an exceptional hotel with excellent service. The view overlooking the park has a calming effect and makes the stay extra special.
The decor of our room was an interesting design incorporating jungle style features.
The uniforms of the staff are exquisite. It oozes style.
We ate often at the Red Oven from the extensive buffet breakfast and from the  a la carte menu. Thai dishes as well as other cuisines are available and all delicious. Amazing experience and service! The moment you walk into the lobby for check in you are treated with much respect and care. We arrived at 9am and they were able to accommodate early check in. The breakfast was great and something we looked forward to every morning. The grounds were beautiful and the gym was very well equipped. Also the coffee shop on the first floor was so yummy! One of the best lattes I had in Bangkok. Rooms were super cute! We got the blue room and thought it was so fun.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

This beautiful old family home has been updated while keeping the feel of its history and culture. It is an oasis of calm in a bustling city within easy walking distance of public transport links. Nothing was too much for the staff team who all spoke excellent English and everything was done with a smile. There was an obvious eye for detail in the way the rooms were made up with plenty of complementary tea, coffee fruit juice and water. The saltwater pool was so much gentler on sensitive skin and with all the lush greenery, it was easy to forget how close you were to the mayhem of Bangkok. Best of all though, was the food. We are not the sort of people who usually stay in our hotel for more than the occasional meal, but the food was so delicious and the menu so varied, we ended up eating there all three nights of our stay. Thank you to the team at Aryasom Villa, we definitely hope to be back one day soon. Our stay at ariyasom villa was perfect.  The staff, the location, the house, the spa everything was great. The massages we had there were amazing. Wed have wanted to extend our stay there, but unfortunately there were no available rooms. We also had a dinner there at the restaurant, there were many vegan options im vegan, but unfortunately in the morning there were very few, choosing the western breakfast type. I suggest to expand the vegan choice a little bit But everything was perfect, this is just a detail.  This is a really nice small hotel with great people. All the staff was amazing. The room was prepared beautifully and beforehand. This reminds me of the Jim Thompson House, an oasis in the big city.
On our second visit, nothing had changed. It had been a few weeks and staff still remembered us. We were greeted with a drink and a warm welcome. They walk you up to your room, which is prepared and already air conditioned so you can cool off. We tried a different room this time. It was a normal size room and it was just as great as the large loft.  We will continue to come here as it is one of my favorites, now. Brilliant location to access canal system or just walk into the bustling centre. Lovely serine setting amongst plenty of tropical greenery. Facilities all fantastic, staff lovely and very friendly, and great food. Would highly recommend and having stayed in many hotels in Thailand this is by far our favourite. A great hotel  more a boutique style. Family run and you can chat to owner over breakfast. Everything is very nice. A great pool area. Ourroomwas very large with seperate lounge. Breakfast is ordered from extensive menu. My only issue was it took ages to get anywhere to see sights  traffic is a huge problem. It took 40 mins to travel 12 km to Grand Palace  plus 25 .in wait for taxi. Thoroughly recommend the hotel though. .","Monday: Open 24 hours

The only part that we think is worth our money was the garden area and your excellent team for giving us absolutely great hospitality.

PS I actually had the worst massage experience at your hotel. We spent about 5,000 baht for 2 people, 2 hours massage. It was a torturous two hours despite me telling the masseur to soften her strength countless times. I did not give her a tip, and her tonality and behaviour changed after that. I actually came home with a back sore due to the massage at your hotel. We spent a week at the Rawakeenlaya and had a fantastic experience. Breakfast buffet is tasty and well priced, however the dinner menu was a standout. The quality and variety is exceptional. We enjoyed a massage at the spa which is also of a very high quality. Rooms are tidy and well appointed. The highlight of our stay was certainly the staff. They were super attentive and so friendly. If you are looking for a boutique hotel experience outside the chaos of the city, I would highly recommend staying at the Rawakeenlaya. Nice for a quick stop. Lovely pool area and relatively quiet location for Bangkok.
I would request a room on the bottom floor not close to the road. Breakfast was excellent but expensive at 300thb
Would return. We had the worst experience at this hotel, would not stay here even if they offered it for free. When we arrived there  the room etc looked fine. Fast forwards half an hour our room was facing the main street with no sound proofing of windows, you could literally hear everything. It overlooks a very busy street so all night long there is a lot of noise, we asked them to change the room as the noise was very bothersome we booked the mattane executive and they said they would charge 1000 bahts extra for the exact same room but without the noise ?!? if you check the price on the website the difference between the garden view which is what was offered to us for the extra price  and city view is around 200 Bahts, but because they knew we were so unhappy with it, they hiked up the charges, knowing that we would likely pay the difference, even though on the website their own official one the price difference is much less. I am convinced that this is how they make most of their money, because nobody would be happy living in that room, so they show a lower price on their website and upcharge you when you get there, knowing you will ask for that room to be changed. It was borderline scam behaviour. Also, if you check older reviews, people have been complaining about the noise for the last 23 years so they know its a problem but are unbothered about fixing it. We didnt check all the reviews before booking, so unfortunately suffered the consequences.

The breakfast was also below average, the sheets smelled and there was a musty, uncleaned odour in the room, and there were mosquitoes as well. We checked out a night early we were booked for two days they didnt offer to refund us the money, knowing full well that it was definitely the fault of the hotel. The staff seemed unbothered which makes me believe that this happens quite a lot, people leaving and them keeping the money they didnt ask what the issue was, why we were checking out early, simply nothing. It was the weirdest experience weve had with a hotel. Im surprised that this hotel is considered five stars, ive stayed in a three star hotel with much better service and amenities.

So dont let the reasonable price fool you, even if you book the garden view they are starting construction on their pool so you will still likely wake up from the noise, and they will not refund you nor change your room if you have an issue. Ive stayed at many hotels in my life, and this has got to be the worst experience I have ever had  please save your money and dont stay here. It is also extremely far from everything, and there is no public transport nearby other than the ferries, so you will be spending a fortune on taxis as well.

I have stayed in four different hotels in Thailand, ranging from 35 stars, and weve had a lovely experience everywhere but this place really ruined our initial experience of Bangkok, as we ended up booking another hotel at a much higher price because it was so last minute.

PS  the cleaning staff was lovely, and this isnt directed towards any of them. A pleasant stay, rooms comfortable. Nowhere to put a suitcase in the room and lack of thought put into furnishing!
Poor breakfast with a lack of vegetarian options.
Pool area OK, not big enough to swim. Beds need replacing!
Fine for exploring the city.

My room offered a breathtaking view of the river, making each morning a delight as I sipped my coffee while basking in the serene landscape. The location of the hotel, right by the river, couldn't have been more perfect. It provided a tranquil and picturesque setting that was both relaxing and rejuvenating.

The food was absolutely delicious. Every meal was a culinary delight, with a wide variety of dishes to choose from. The breakfast, in particular, was outstanding. Enjoying a hearty meal with a stunning view of the river was the perfect way to start each day.

The swimming pool was another standout feature. It was beautifully designed and maintained, offering a refreshing escape after a day of exploring the nearby attractions. The poolside area was equally inviting, perfect for lounging and soaking up the sun.

In summary, my stay at GLOW Bangkok Riverside was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of friendly staff, prime riverfront location, stunning views, pristine cleanliness, great gym, attention to detail, super fast internet, delicious food, and relaxing amenities made for a truly memorable experience. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a peaceful and luxurious getaway. We stayed here for two nights while visiting Bangkok.  It is a new hotel you can smell how new it is when you walk in the door! The hotel itself is beautiful , so clean great pool and amazing views of the river.  Our room was big which was fantastic as travelling with a 1 year old so he had plenty of space to run around. The room was so comfy that I actually felt at home.. it had a lovely tv with loads of channels to choice from if you were staying in which we did as not a lot in the area to do unless you get taxis. That the only complaint I have is the location. There is nothing around the hotel itself, no bars or restaurants so we used grab and had some beers in t room. We enjoyed it !! But no nightlife in the area at all.. but I do need to give a massive shoutout to the staff wow they are all so good! Rada Gift ohm were all amazing and even the manager herself ! We had an issue with taxi last day and they could not do more for you fantastic Hotel , I would return when visiting Bangkok again I recently stayed October 2024 at a wonderful new hotel by the Chao Phraya River, just a short distance from the city. It's easy to get around, with the MRT Station Sirindhorn only about 15 minutes away by car, and you can reach the Chatuchak Weekend Market in just a few stops.

If you're looking for a peaceful, relaxing place to recharge, I highly recommend this hotel. The staff are fantasticfriendly, attentive, and always ready to assist. Their warm hospitality truly made my stay special. I will definitely be returning! Staff is friendly and helpful.
Room is big and clean and the hotel is located on the  riverside and very close to MRT or other tourist spots.
nice swimming pool with good view.

I have only given four stars because it has the unfulfilled potential to be the very best hotel in Bangkok. For 25 rooms there are only 25 staff as far as I understand. This shows up as a reduced level of service in many ways. Owner, without criticism, I would urge you to instal an experienced General Manager who will be able to take this property to the level it deserves. I love the food and drinks there, Khun Joe and Khun Oak are so great. They serviced us very well. And I will definitely go there again because of both of them. Plus, the security guard is so goooood. He lead us to the restaurant with great attitude. Great place. The staff were very nice and kind. They always gave us a great smile. comfe friendly stuff kind of privacy  i guess i""ll back again some day , but the food i didnt try it all  just the coffee actually ! And its far for shopping mall get 27 minutes some time Best place to stay in Bangkok. I just fell in love with this hotel. Pang and Kat, who helped with check in and guided me to the room were very polite and friendly. I felt such a great comfort and warmth.

The rooms are clean and cozy, the shower is great, the staff is very friendly. You can also use the hotel gym not big but has all the basic equipment for a good workout. There's also a very nice terrace next to the pool where you can sit in the evening and enjoy a drink. The area where the hotel is located it amazing, you can do pretty much everything there there's a big selection of nice restaurants, bars, and 2 parks. 1010 The location is located in many bars. If you are traveling with a family, you should pay attention to this, but the transportation is really convenient! It takes about five minutes to walk to 711 and BTS. It is very convenient to go to various shopping malls. It is very close to terminal21 and can be reached on foot! There is a swimming pool and bar on the top floor and a gym on the first floor. It is really a great hotel. I stayed here for nine nights. I highly recommend it to friends who come to Bangkok. The hotel staff are very friendly. the hygiene is difficult to judge, house keeping doing great work of making up the room but only when the lady in my photo is on duty, the day when a house keeping boy do the room makeup, he didnt do it well. on the other hand, there are mold next to the air conditioner you can see in the photo, it is hard to accept since the hotel is quite new and doing good in most of the facilities maintenance.

the pool is beautiful in day and night, if you are a swimmer you will find it too small.

the location is accessible but the street light along the way is literally no illuminating in night and don't forget it is not family friendly to the 5 minutes pass by walking from the BTS station since the bars located around is famous in it's working girl services.

Overall I will say this is a not bad hotel, the bed is good, the bathroom is also clean and new, but the value for money is not so high since there are so many details didn't presenting well. Definitely recommend this hotel. Rooms were big and quiet, ac worked well. Rooftop pool was amazing and the water was perfect temp to swim during the day and night. Breakfast is amazing. Location was great for the train. Convenient location which near to some major mall. However just take note if your are travelling with young children or family as this hotel located near many bar. Other than that location, service, cleanliness and comfort I would give 5 stars.","Monday: Open 24 hours

English is spoken. The hotel staff are extremely polite and caring for your comfort and satisfaction. The suites are roomy and comfortable with a modern design style. The bathroom is dazzling! WiFi, cable TV, a washerdryer, and a fully equipped kitchen easily lend to a comfortable home away from home experience. Public transportation is a short walk away as are convenient stores. I will definitely stay here again. We encountered problems during our 11day stay at this hotel about 2 times, but the hotel fixed for us . That is going well.
The manager comes to talk with us very well. However, The staff and maid and receptionists did a great job and were very polite. However, when them resolved the situation, I recommended that this is also a good hotel
And the hotel is quiet The rooms are clean. Incredible stay at Amanda Hotel  Residence Sathorn! These are fully furnished apartments with the same services as hotels. Super spacious living space equipped with a fully stocked supply wise kitchen, bathroom with a separate shower and bathtub, and an in unit washer dryer which came in super handy during the trip. It is a bit of a walk from the main road but its close to a lot of eateries and a 711. It is a quiet hotel in a centrally located area. The hotel is really kidfriendly with spacious rooms, fully equipped with a kitchen, washing machine and iron. The bathroom was very clean with a big bath tub and a fancy toilet with sensor which I really liked about. The swimming pool area is very nice which made me feel that I am in a different place like Phuket or Bali. Breakfast is ok with a variety to choose. The hotel rooms might be not so new but I really recommend this hotel for families. You can go to the Jodd fair night market which is 1520 min walk from the hotel. Decent hotel in terms of facilities, service and hygiene. Gym room also offers sufficient equipment for you to have a indepth ,sweating workout. Around 7 minutes walk to the nearby Lumphini MRT station. There are many nice restaurants in the surrounding area, which is also quiet in the evening. However, as some review points out,stained towels are common and its a bit unpleasant to use. Other than that ,
I still have a memorable stay here and would definitely return.","Monday: Open 24 hours

We've had an absolutely wonderful time at Ten Sir Hundred Hotel Bangkok! The hotel's ambiance is truly luxurious, with every detail carefully curated for a comfortable and stylish stay. The staff have been incredibly friendly and helpful, going above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed.

From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the hotel's elegant design and impeccable service. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed, and the amenities are topnotch. We particularly enjoyed the luxurious spa and the stunning pool area.

If you're looking for a truly exceptional hotel experience in Bangkok, we highly recommend Ten Sir Hundred. It's a perfect choice for those seeking a combination of luxury, comfort, and impeccable service. The room we had was very nice, we booked the duplex room. the staff is friendly and attentive. the hotel is clean and very modern. the staff at rooftop should be more attentive and not at the phone while working but the were nice as the rest of the hotel staff. the only no go and this is why only 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that they charge for slippers and laundry bag, i dont know are you using the slippers again for next guest? otherwise can totally recommend it with its nice location at the river. Our experience at this luxury hotel is incredible. Located along the banks of the Chao Phraya River in a serene neighborhood, the hotel offers a perfect retreat from the bustling heart of Bangkok. Very peaceful ambiance, a true escape, allowing you to unwind and relax completely. The staff are exceptional, and the rooms and amenities are nothing short of superb. I highly recommend this gem for anyone staying in Bangkok We spent a week here for a bit of a getaway on a 20 day trip to thailand. We booked the private pool room which was amazing! Being able to go out at 12pm at night and just relax in the pool watching the river cruises pass by was exquisite!

The staff were great aswell from the breakfast staff making sure all our needs were tended too and the security making sure we were safe on entering and exiting the hotel. Nuk was a great receptionist assisting us with booking a taxi to the airport and being very informative during our stay.

All I can say is if you have some money to spare on a new hotel this is the one.

The only Cons is the location is down a dark road. The deposit on arrival is a bit of a surprise too. Amazing experience we had at Ten Six Hundred. We wanted to spend sometime away from the buzzling city center areas and found TSH suited the vibes we were looking for. The access to boat tours on the Chao Phraya River, and clean and luxurious private pool overlooking the river.
The room was clean and spacious. Staff were friendly and helpful. We had a nice romantic dinner in the evening with the view of the river and the city at night. and also enjoyed ourselves at the Rooftop pool. The ambience during the evening was on point as well.

Thank you, TEN SIX HUNDRED!",no operation time,"bar, lodging, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment"

Centrally located close to Khao San, 711 across the street, ..., very clean and fancy.
I felt like a princess in my room. Loved it so much ! Most comfortable bed I had in Thailand. The jacuzzi adds a nice touch. The lights in the room allow you to create the atmosphere you like.
I guess for two people, the bathroom lacks a bit of privacy but for me, as a solo traveler, it was perfect.
The rooftop area with the pool  amazing !
At night, you can feel the room is not really soundproof but it's ok.
I will definitely come back  Great location, very close to Khaosan Road. The staff was very nice and friendly. They offered us some local juice as a refreshment when we arrived. The room was spacious and clean. All necessary things were in the room. Big bathroom with a bathtub with jacuzzi. The swimming pool on the roof was amazing, nice view of Bangkok, great place to cool down and not too crowded. Also there was a gym next to the pool. They also offer breakfast but we decided to eat local food in the area. I can recommend this hotel, good prices for what they offer. We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and absolutely loved it. The location was amazing as it was a quiet neighbourhood but still close to the popular sights to see. The rooms were nice with the hot tub and good functioning airconditioning. The service was great, luggage brought to the room and taxis were arranged quickly when you asked. The breakfast was good but more expensive for Thailand. This is a lovely, peaceful hotel. The pool has lovely views of the area, and serves both food and drink directly to your sun loungers. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and we were able to book a taxi to the airport at 2am from the reception without any issue. The one thing to consider is that as this hotel is in a quiet area near to Khao San road, temples, the river it isn't well connected transport wise. Other than getting taxis or buses your best bet is the water taxi down to the palace, then to walk to the nearest metro stop, which takes around half an hour all in all, without air conditioning. We were glad we chose this location in the end, but it takes some thinking about if you want to get to the commercial districts! A decent hotel, great location. Service is not really good and the staff was really unenthusiastic. The rooms are super bizarre there was only a curtain between the bed space and the bathroom, which made it very uncomfortable if you're staying with someone else.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The location is central, just right by Ratchadamri BTS and a stroll from Central World etc so you can beat the traffic. This is perfect for anyone, staying a few days and wanting extra space balcony, living room and a little kitchenette. There is no washing machine but laundry service is available. Service is warm and really helpful. Breakfast is good  adequate with small cookedtoorder menu and a light buffet don't expect the crazy spreads of the big hotels but if you want an omelette and coffee, it's perfect. Wonderful. All the staff go out there way to make your experience so enjoyable. The lower stars for room cleaning was not because of the staff themselves, rather they are so busy and so many rooms to look after.

The food is amazing and Earth restaurant manager runs a tight ship. Even though we tried elsewhere for food, including street food, Earths team and the amazing chef meant we ate well in the hotel. Did I mention the cocktails?  They are best we have had in Bangkok.

In all I wish I could give 10 stars just for the staff alone and their attention to detail. Hotels in the UK could learn from these guys Good hotel with good service  very nice restaurant. Lot a of different international Food choices  all very good. Lovely staff. Good equipped gym. The pool area could have upgrade. It could be a lot nicer with some small changes. But I understand this is shared with the appartments in the same building Everything is exceptional. I truly love staying here. The pool is cleanthey clean it at least twice a day and the service is absolutely awesome. I even joined the membership so I can come back later again!! Will definitely do that. The caferestaurant at the lobby levelDusit Gourmet provides a great quality of food and drinks. Excellent hotel, and Service. Staffs are very friendly. Only drawback was breakfast options very less and space very small. Also if kids club and kids activity there definitely will prefer next time. Location is great.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Kimpton Maa-Lai Bangkok,"78 Soi Ton Son, Khwaeng Lumphini, Pathum Wan, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10330, Thailand",4.9,13.73768,100.543443,"The hotel has a very impressive and thoughtful design. The checkin experience is particularly special, with the reception desk set up more like an island where staff and guests can connect better, rather than being separated by a large formal desk. This creates a more welcoming and personal atmosphere.

An additional unique aspect is that the hotel accommodates guests' pets as well. The breakfast buffet, though requiring some waiting in line, offers delicious and tasty meal options.

Overall, the hotel seems to have put a lot of care into crafting an exceptional hospitality experience for its guests, from the innovative lobby design to the petfriendly policies. The combination of attentive service, attractive spaces, and quality food makes for an enjoyable stay. My experience at the hotel was amazing! The reception team was wonderful, very helpful, and they clearly explained the available facilities both within the hotel and nearby. However, what I didnt like was that the hotel charged a security deposit of approximately 1200, even though I had already paid for the stay in full before arrival. I didnt quite understand why the deposit was necessary, especially since the rooms were already fully paid. This is unlike other international hotels, but I was prepared for it. Im just mentioning it so others are aware that the hotel requires a deposit even if youve paid the full amount for your stay beforehand.

Aside from that, the facilities were excellent, and the breakfast was quite good and suited our preferences. A special shoutout to the Palestinian gentleman who was very welcoming and helpful, as was the entire team. I came to stay at this hotel because I was very impressed with the service and cleanliness. When Im come stay when 2 years ago , But when I came back this year, many things seemed to have changed. The elevator smelled of cigarette smoke very bad. Our room cost 26,900 but there was dust all over the bed and sheets. And in the room!!! I talked to the staff and she said that there was no new room to change for us, but she would clean it. But that was almost 3 am. We need to waiting to clean 15 minutes so we said NO! And she said that or we would move back to the same room that we stay before but she forgot to think that we paid for the room upgrade. It was free upgrade!!!! So I asked if they would refund me for the upgrade, but they said that they would hang up and talk to the housekeeper to solve the problem. Finally, they changed the room for us, but waited until 3 am and I was very disappointed.

When we asked for a refund, the staff said that they would have the housekeeper come and check if there was really dust, then there would be a case for a refund. I waited for the housekeeper for almost 10 minutes, no one came, but they took their time to rearrange the room for us at first they said there was no new room to change.

They tried to say that their room would not be able to see if there was dust at night because we upgraded during the night????? Since I have slept in many hotels, every hotel usually has a very good standby room and usually does not have this excuse.

This is some of the dust traces I was able to take pictures , and I think they should have taken care to wipe the glass clean as well.

This will be the last time I will stay at this hotel and I will not come again. Waste of money, waste of time, waste of feelings. The night staff's service is not good her speak like her not like to service! we don't pay a high price to be treated cheaply

We will not come back anymore 

If we want to stay in the back Langsuan area, this hotel is not suitable for us half way through a wonderful stay here so far and thought it should comment earlier rather than waiting for the end.

I have say thanks to the team for the upgrade to the junior suite. The room is bigger than my home! The bed is firm but exceptionally comfortable. The airconditioning is great.

The facilities in the hotel are tremendous. The pool is a good size. The gym is insane. The breakfast is out of this world.

Perhaps the one inconvenience is the location. A little far from the BTS if walking in the heat. But still very convenient in general location wise. Would totally come back and looking forward to my remaining nights here I stayed here for 3 nights with my cats. Even though I booked around 1800 and went there around 2000, they prepared everything perfectly for my cats and human!
During the room cleaning, owners have to stay with their pets, so I decided to take them to the cafe downstairs Craft
I personally enjoyed the gym and the kickboxing class there, and my cats seem like they enjoyed the cat tower and the new environment!

Some 5star hotels, although they say they are topnotch, doesn't mean they are going to serve you from left to right, maybe it's a cultural difference, maybe each person think differently, I don't know, but this hotel served everything I needed, not too much, but it was just enough and right for me! I now understand why this hotel has a very high rate, 4.9, in which compared to the 5star hotels located around this area, they don't have 4.9.

I will definitely come back here again with my cats! Highly recommended for anyone who have furry friends or else!","Monday: Open 24 hours

We booked three rooms and then upgraded all three to river view  pool suites. The service was exceptional, the rooms, the amenities were screaming luxury. The software on their tablet was pretty solid and eliminated the calling part. Met a couple Indian celebs even Indian cricket head coach.

The food was exceptional, breakfast was small but great. I expected river to be clearer but it looked muddy. Skyline from the room is not that great as so much empty space and construction going on. But the quality of stay was top notch. Would visit again. The Capella hotel is adjacent to the four seasons hotel in Bangkok over looking the river. The hotel offers spacious new and well maintained rooms. The breakfast is of high quality but pricey. If you ask me if I will ever come back here again, my answer is no. The staff did their best but didn't win me over and make me feel special despite paying the high rental price per night. I felt that there was something missing, that I was just another guest in the hotel, and also the hotel doesn't have any homey feeling to it. However, it was worth the experience and I do recommend to try it even if once. Capella Bangkok was my best decision for our family trip to Bangkok in June 2024.
I stayed for three days at my own expense.

The staff were always where I needed them, attentive to every detail and ready to listen, knowing who I am

For my 8year old son, who was visiting Bangkok for the first time, Capella made the city beautiful to him and created happy memories for my wife and me as well.

I will never hesitate to choose Capella again for our next trip to Bangkok, and I will strongly recommend it to my friends.

I believe that what defines the best hotel is the level of service provided by its staff, more than its grand facilities. I want to extend my gratitude to all the staff for always keeping a smile and offering exceptional kindness. This hotel was chosen for our first family trip. Everyone was truly satisfied from the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out.

Thanks to the staff members, Aoei and Film, we were able to relax and organize everything comfortably before heading to the airport.

If we visit Bangkok again, we would definitely want to stay at Capella Hotel.

We sincerely thank all the staff at Capella for helping us create the best memories with our family.

Thank you so much. Now i know what a 6 Star hotel is all about
Capella Bangkok had exceeded all expectations on the level of service, stylish luxury room, delicious Fb and location on Bangkok river.
Beautiful boutique property  we booked a jacuzzi suite and didnt not disappoint. Private plunge pool with spacious outdoor area of dinning relating over looking the river and city skyline. Room service, breakfast and Thai dinner were perfect. Private boat shuttle to take you to BTS , shopping districts is the best way to travel around Bangkok. The service and genuine care they showed my family  children was above and beyond. We truly felt like royalty in this property.",no operation time,"lodging, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment"

We traveled to Bangkok for 4 days and stayed in the family suite with the kids in one room and we had another room.  The staff was wonderful.  The rooms were great with an amazing view and the amenities were awesome.  The kids loved the pool and great view of the city from the pool.  Another positive was the club amenities since the we got the breakfast in the morning and the afternoon happy hour and snacks after a long day of tours.

Definitely would recommend this hotel for your stay. We stayed there 4 times and would definitely  stay again. Very kind stuff, nice view, good breakfast and perfect located with shuttle service by boat. Lee love the view. Four years ago they served healthy drinks at breakfast start and also a special coffee which was the best coffee we ever had. We are sad that this is not existing anymore and you get a good standard coffee.
Nevertheless we love this hotel and will stay there whenever we will be in Bangkok. It was phenomenal.  First things first the rooms were amazing, they are spacious and the beds were comfortable. You were able to see both city and the river side if you booked a room just close enough to both and the view was amazing. Cant forget the amazing hospitality and professionalism they showed when you show up to the hotel and during breakfast.

I would highly recommend this hotel and if I come back to visit Bangkok I would definitely stay there once again. We stayed here as a family 2 adults, 2 children and whilst we had an enjoyable stay, the hotel really isn't a 5 hotel in my opinion. The room was large and relatively comfortable with an impressive view, but looking a little tired in terms of decor think Holiday Inn, the advertised Smart TV didn't work, and as the days went by the cleaning staff seemed to be less and less interested, replacing fewer and fewer items, and in the end just leaving a couple of bottles of water on the kitchen counter. They also seemed unwilling for us to charge anything to our room, saying we hadn't paid  a deposit would have been very happy to have left credit card details if that had been offered at any point. One day we came back from a long, hot day sightseeing and were unable to get into our room as they had disabled our key cards.  And on another occasion, at the restaurant they entirely forgot to make and bring my husbands meal. Meaning he ate after the rest of the family had finished. We also tried to use the concierge service to get us a taxi at one point. After waiting for quite a while, and seeing several other guests successfully led into a taxi, we just booked one ourselves via an app. And last but not least, superbly sullen staff on Reception at check in.  Not a smile or a welcome at all. We had travelled quite a lot around Thailand for the last few weeks and while this was apparently the highest star rated hotel, I can confidently say it was by far the worst service. I think perhaps the star rating is just about its location, which I agree is fabulous. This place was great. Not necessarily the wow factor before you go inside as the outside area at the front is fairly compact. Once into the lobby though the place lives up to its 5 star billing.
Huge, well appointed rooms, amazing buffet breakfast, perfect pool with sun all day, ideally located next to the river with a free ferry up to the main pier and IconSiam.
I will be staying again in my next visit and I cant wait to go back!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Jasmine Resort Hotel,"PH8R+8CW 1511 ถนน สุขุมวิท 67 Khwaeng Phra Khanong Nuea, Watthana, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand",4.2,13.715731,100.5910181,"Unfortunately, we experienced severe cleanliness issues in our room, particularly with the bed linens and sheets. These problems caused significant inconvenience and affected our rest, and I feel it is necessary to inform you so that you can address and improve your service.

Upon our arrival, we immediately noticed that the bed linens and sheets were extremely dirty, which was highly unsatisfactory. More disturbingly, we found noticeable bloodstains on the sheets, which shocked and disturbed us. Such unsanitary conditions not only affected our rest but also posed a threat to our health and safety.

Furthermore, the overall cleanliness of the room was subpar, with visible dust and litter on the floor, and the bathroom was not properly cleaned. This environment made it impossible for us to relax and enjoy our vacation as we should have. We believe that a renowned resort hotel should provide a higher standard of cleanliness and service, rather than making guests feel uncomfortable and dissatisfied.

These issues not only ruined our travel plans but also impacted our overall experience. We came to Thailand to relax and enjoy our holiday, but due to these hygiene issues, we had to spend a lot of time and energy dealing with these problems, which completely contradicted our initial purpose.

We hope you will take guest feedback seriously, continuously improve the quality of your services, and prevent similar issues from happening again. Location is good but they need to fix the lifts, the aircon is old and they need to fix the sewerage. Sometimes the rooms smell. This was 5 star many years ago and now youre looking at 34. Staff is nice Stayed here for 2N.

Room  was clean, spacious, service apartment style. Bed and pillows a bit hard for me. There is a bit of noise from the traffic our room faced the road, but did not really bother us.

The kitchenette has plates, pots and pans and a washer dryer but there was no soap or detergent provided.

The thing that we disliked the most was how slippery the bathroom floor was. You have to put the rubber mat down on the shower floor.

Service Very friendly and helpful. They called the room in the evening to ask if we needed cleaning, and I asked for water. Housekeeping sent it almost immediately.

Check in was fast and efficient, we had to put a 1000 baht security deposit which was returned at checkout.

Location Literally at the doorstep of the train station. In fact they have a sign in the hotel lobby pointing to the train. However, like many BTS stations, there does not seem to be a lift on the hotel side so if you have luggage it might be challenging.

There is a supermarket just next door, which has a lot of ready to eat meals and basic groceries to cook with, and a large pharmacy on the other side.

The main reason for choosing this hotel was its location to the place I needed to be at early in the morning. Not sure if I would stay here again because it was a little pricey for just sleeping I did not use of the facilities.

Breakfast selection was ok, there is quite a lot of pork, even in the eggs so fyi we dont eat pork. Location was amazing. Front desk service was nice and quick.
BTS is in front of the hotel.
Hotel has swimming pool, gym, room has a bathtub.
Room has microwave which was nice.
Only downside is the TV was outdated without smart feature. So this is not a hotel I stayed at, but a friend of mine came over for a 3 week break. So this was a hotel I would 100 stay at because all the staff members greeted us even though we were not staying, and it made it easy to communicate with them. The grand entrance, a doorman, will open and greet as you step into the hotel .My friend invited us to his room on the 17th floor, and I was taken aback by how clean and tidy the place was before entering his room .Once inside his room, i was again taken aback with the space and saperate lounge from the bedroom. The unsuite bathroom was nice and spacious as well, but overall, he was well happy he booked this room for the first time from the UK, and he will be booking in the near future. The other good thing is there is a BTS station just outside of this Jasmine Resort Hotel, and their transporting here is very good and cheap. So highly recommend if you are looking to stay in Bangkok.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Everything was absolutely perfect, the room was clean and with every facility you can think of. The in room dining was delicious and the butler service was amazing. They will help you with anything youll need, from taking your luggage and heavy bags to your room, to deliver tea to your room anytime.
I also recommend the breakfast which was amazing and with huge variety of fresh food, or food that made in place.
Everyone in this hotel staff was super nice and helpful and I will come back again for sure Its been a while since I last stayed at St. Regis Bangkok, but it still feels as wonderful as ever. I absolutely love their rooms, especially with the stunning golf course view. The location is unbeatablewithin walking distance to the famous FourFaced Buddha, Central World, SuperRich money exchange, the Apple Store, big C, pharmacy  and many other convenient shops.

From the moment I walked into the hotel, I felt a warm welcome from the staff, making me feel right in many ways. The bed was incredibly comfortable, the shower was fantastic and the room had everything I needed for a perfect stay. The inroom dining was also delicious and exceeded my expectations.

Special thanks to the amazing frontline team who truly know how to make their guests feel special. I can't wait to come back. My experience at The St. Regis Bangkok was nothing short of exceptional. I stopped by the hotel for a meeting, but was immediately impressed by the luxurious ambiance and impeccable service that greeted me upon arrival.

The hotel's grand lobby exudes elegance and sophistication, setting the tone for a truly upscale experience. The staff members were attentive, courteous, and went above and beyond to ensure that my needs were met throughout my visit.

The meeting facilities at The St. Regis Bangkok were topnotch, with wellequipped rooms and stateoftheart technology that made conducting business a breeze. The rooms were beautifully appointed, creating a professional and elegant atmosphere that was conducive to productive discussions.

After the meeting, I had the opportunity to enjoy a meal at one of the hotel's restaurants, and I was blown away by the culinary offerings. The food was not only delicious, but also beautifully presented, showcasing the skill and talent of the hotel's culinary team. The dining experience was further enhanced by the impeccable service from the waitstaff, who were attentive and ensured that every detail was taken care of.

I also had the chance to explore some of the hotel's other amenities, such as the spa and fitness center, and was impressed by the high quality and attention to detail in every aspect of the hotel. The spa offered a range of treatments that were both relaxing and rejuvenating, while the fitness center was wellequipped with modern equipment for a great workout

Overall, my experience at The St. Regis Bangkok was truly outstanding. From the luxurious surroundings to the attentive service and exceptional facilities, every aspect of my visit exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend The St. Regis Bangkok to anyone looking for a luxurious and memorable hotel experience, whether it be for business or leisure. I give The St. Regis Bangkok a welldeserved fivestar rating and look forward to returning in the future. I stayed St. Regis for 2 night in a suite room 2X11. It's profound satisfaction with the exceptional service I received. The experience was truly memorable, and I felt compelled to commend your team for their outstanding hospitality.

From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the professionalism and warmth of your staff. The checkin process was smooth and efficient, and the concierge provided valuable information that enhanced my stay. The hotel amenities, St. Regis's coconut highly recommends.

I would like to extend special gratitude to the butler service team, to ensure my comfort and satisfaction. Their attention to detail, prompt response to requests, and personalized service were remarkable. It is rare to encounter such dedication and commitment to excellence, and it significantly contributed to the enjoyment of my stay, nothing short of extraordinary! Fantastic hotel with a luxurious room. Butler service was fast and attentive. My suitcase was delivered up to my room very quickly and my butler brought me an iced coffee in just a couple minutes St. Regis Singapore took comparatively much longer. Location is great, with a train station connected directly to the hotels 2nd floor.

The room was large and comfy. The view of the golf course was pleasant. The pool was serviceable with poolside staff proactively delivering towels and water. The bar on the 12th floor was a nice sanctuary from the ravenous rain and thunder that pummels down every summer evening.

Id certainly return.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Their response times have been exceedingly slow. I had a query regarding the bed in the room, and despite my repeated followups, it took them an unacceptable amount of time to finally address my concerns.

I made it clear that the bed is for a senior guest, yet the team suggested providing a baby step stool or a baby bed guard. This raises significant safety concerns, as it could lead to potential trips or falls for a senior guest, making it difficult for them to get in and out of bed safely bed guard.  It also suggests that the Reservation Team does not prioritize guest safety.

After nearly three weeks of waiting for a resolution, I was informed that the promotion I inquired about is no longer available for my planned stay. If this was the case, I believe I should have been informed sooner, rather than being asked to wait repeatedly while they conducted internal discussions.

Having stayed at several Four Seasons properties, I have never experienced such a lack of service. This has been a notably disappointing experience, and it seems that the Reservation Team's inefficiencies are hindering the overall business.

Their Reservation Team are dampening our vacation mood. Belated review. I had a wonderful 4 days stay at Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok in May this year. The hotel has excellent public areas, but unfortunately some of the room facilities are problematic and the sign for the shuttle boat from the hotel to ICONSIAM is not very clear. I suggest that the hotel can make a more obvious sign at the ICONSIAM boat station. Special praise for the hotel's duty manager Ploy, she is such an excellent employee, warm, friendly and professional service, she solved the room problem I encountered during my stay at the hotel, I sincerely thank Ploy for her help from the bottom of my heart I will give you 10 stars if you have 10 stars.
Absolutely wonderful experience, and the service was great with personal touches.
We were always being well taken care of, and they can anticipate what we want. We don't even need to ask. Absolutely lovely. Beautiful, modern Stylish.  Room is very comfortable. Amazing bed and linens. Great restaurants     The Hotel is above expectations All I can say is this is where we will stay from now on while in Bangkok. The level of service, luxury, room, food, etc., was nothing but spectacular! We will definitely be back, thank you for the hospitality!

The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, greeting us with welcome drinks and a thorough introduction to the hotel.

The Siam beautifully blends British colonial with traditional Thai elements.  While it's tucked away from the city center, the riverside setting is a welcome escape from the business of Bangkok.  Reaching the city is easy with taxis or the hotel's own water taxi service, which can be booked through the front desk.  If you booked your trip, I would suggest reaching out to the concierge via WhatsApp you'll find the number on their website  they're incredibly helpful!

Our suite was spacious.  Service throughout the hotel was impeccable, and the food was exceptional  both breakfast and dinner were highlights.  The hotel is filled with fascinating antique pieces both in the rooms and throughout the property.

We had a truly unique Bangkok experience at the Siam.  And don't miss the spa  the massages were the perfect way to unwind at the end of our trip. Topnotch service in an extremely beautifully designed hotelenvironment.
I enjoyed my stay at The Siam and felt being much cared. Breakfast is amazingly yummy with a diversity of western and Thai cuisines. The gym is very good as well. Our room at the Siam was spacious, with great and special dcor. The breakfast was elegant and quality with a variety of options!  The staff were very friendly,  attentive and went out of their way to ensure that we were comfortable and happy. The highlight during our stay was the hotel's generous and surprising offering for my birthday  beautiful roses and a nice chocolate cake! The impeccable service and hospitality of the staff as well as the unique history and incomparable luxury of the hotel made our holiday most enjoyable. We just completed our stay at The Siam and WOW. We have stayed at beautiful hotels around the world, but the service at this hotel is unparalleled. The hotel is stunning, the staff are simply AMAZING. Each person is nicer than the last and they create a true five star experience. I am leaving just floored. We are very sad to leave! The Siam Hotel might just be the best hotel in the world and definitely the most amazing one I've ever stayed in. Everything here is perfect the architecture is breathtaking both inside and out, and the rooms feel like you're living in an art museum. Its pricey, but worth every pennyespecially compared to other more expensive hotels that dont come close to this level of service and experience.

The service is truly outstanding, with the staff making you feel incredibly special. We not only received excellent restaurant recommendations, but we were also taken there by the hotels own boat and picked up later, with a lovely little tour along the Chao Phraya River. The atmosphere is a perfect blend of relaxed luxury and personal attention, making every moment at The Siam an unforgettable experience.

The location is fantastic, the food and service is wonderful!
We highly recommend the hotel and the rooftop bar which is open to everyone not only guests.
Live show every night, the drinks are very good and the service crew is amazing!

We were lucky that they upgraded our room to a premium one. Very modern, clean  tidy. We had a relaxing stay plus they have a nice rooftop bar with a live band where you can jam with good music. Food  drinks were lovely. All staff were accommodating  approachable. Special thanks to the friendly staff of rooftop bar namely Pim, Don, Whan, Cream.  Kind, accommodating, professional staffs
Definitely recommend.

Breakfast at the 1st floor restaurant is a highlight, featuring an extraordinary variety of delicious and highquality options. The restaurant provides a pleasant atmosphere with a selection of delectable salads, fan cakes, and buggers.

Especially, Ms.Ying and Ms. Pim were very kind and we were touched by service of the restaurant every morning. I recently stayed at the Tastoria Collection Sukhumvit and had an amazing experience. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and equipped with all the modern amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The staff's exceptional service made my stay truly memorable.

Upon checking in, there were a few small spots of rusty red stains on the bedsheets in the master bedroom, but that was changed promptly once we let reception know. The couch was also due for a clean.

Apart from that, the place was quiet, serene, and perfect to be slightly away from the hustle and bustle that is the city centre. Ill definitely consider Kokotel again when coming back to Bangkok! The Kokotel is great for families. The kids loved the playground, and the rooms are amazing value for the price.

Be warned that the internet is basically unusable they've got a captive portal that just barely works. I tried to get a speedtest to illustrate, but it won't stay connected long enough to actually get a result. The Customer service is so bad. I went to front office and asked price for a month and what kind of room kokotel have, she responded a bit angrily, like she's not interested in responding and already went away to talk with other staff while i haven't finish my question. I never see front office staff with this manner before omg.
But the room is good and clean, lobby is awesome. My problem is only with that aunty, annoying af Enjoying a very nice coffee at Kokotel Dheva Thonglor. The place is nice and clean, with a view on the river. Rooms are providing all the essential for a very attractive price. Staff and Management are competent, friendly and responsive, making guests feeling welcomed. Last but not least, the hotel is family friendly, with playground for the youngest.

Unfortunately, we found out the pool was under maintenance during our stay and we were not informed prior to our arrival. Had we known, we would have considered other hotels.

I like the location, many local eats and convenience stores accessible by foot. The pier is a stones throw away.

Breakfast was simple but of good variety and quantify and they vary the options day to day.

The room had a fantastic bed and linens. I had very good sleep there. The bathroom didnt feel luxurious enough, was more on the basic side. The shower stall seemed to always flood into the main area of the bathroom. Amenities were not of the sort I wanted to use for the hair

I used the gym room most mornings. Had it mostly to myself. Was very basic treadmill, dumbbells, dual cable machine, various benches, yoga mats but was good enough for a holiday workout.

The pool was a bit disappointing to the fact that only a very small part of it was exposed to the sun. These were only two loungers that were in such a space, so if it was taken you had to wait a long while to have sun access.

Overall would stay again but will contact about the pool beforehand. Exceptional experience, this will be my forever resting place in Bangkok. If not, the best hotel experience ever.

Going around make sure to download the Grab app, it's like Southeast Asia's Uber.

Location 35min to 1 hr from the airport depending on traffic. There's restaurant and tours for sale outside the hotel. Hotel restaurant is open from 8am  10pm and I am telling you, it is DELICIOUS! and it has outdoor sitting facing the river, where you can see canal tour, buffest cruises and birds passing by. Walking distance from the grand palace and other parks.

Staff Staff opened the door of our grab ride for us, and umbrella us from the sun. Upon lobby arrival we were warmly greeted with beverage and a wet towel, seated on a comfy lobby while they check us in. Staff delivers ice when we need it, and they assist in explaining mini bar charges. I am so humbled by their treatment. It is indeed exceptional, and they always have a smile on their face as if they are very happy to be in your presence.

Room LARGE. There's dining, living room, balcony, huge stand up shower room. Smells good and new, cozy and comfy, river view, fresh linen, clean, I can't flaw it. Huge balcony with chairs, table, and pool bed. Lots of light settings available and I love the interior.

I would recommend it to everyone I know. Just amazing. A lovely, newly built hotel!
The rooms are stylish, spacious, and provide all the amenities one could ask for.
The staff is extremely welcoming, attentive, and always ready to help.
We stayed two nights and I definitely recommend it, especially for its given location. Regardless of the renovation currently in progress a good sign!, the Riva Surya remains consistent in its remarkably delightful service, impeccably maintained rooms and exceptional value for price. Brilliant breakfast on the river as well. 'Always look forward this wonderful respite! This hotel was fabulous! It was such a lovely experience where every staff member was so polite and attentive to us. It felt we were taken care of very much. Thank you for that, really.

They couldnt do enough for us  particularly the pool guys who all work so hard. Credit to them. Speaking of, the pool is amazing and like a resort in the middle of the city.

Club room is a bit dated but overall lovely and a bit of old Thailand charm.

A similar comment on the soft pillows but nothing that impacted stay. A pillow menu would make this complete.

Location is really great. The traffic out of the hotel in the evening rush hour is tough if heading to the river but elsewhere has been fine.

Would highly recommend and we will be back. Nice big Room 37 sqm.with wooden floor giving a Flair of IndoChina.Nice Breakfast ,more like a good Brunch.Big Pool but nothing for me.I'm more  a Gym guy and they have the best big Gym in town ! My favorite is the very good  SAUNA.Hotel is near center of Bangkok.Super clean ,nice small garden to relax. Absolutely loved it.
The staff in every department were incredible, rooms very very comfortable and HUGE! I thought the breakfast Buffett was one of the best in the world, I wish I wasn't trying to eat a bit less, but the variety was astounding.
Dinner on the rooftop was sublime, food, view and presentation, faultless and superb value overall! Stayed here for 1 night transitioning through Bangkok in February of 2023. Didnt come away very impressed. The hotel is nice, but the service was strange at best for a 5star hotel. We had a flight the next day, so I asked them arrange a taxi, the guy at the front desk refused and said theyd hail one, at checkout. I insisted, but got nowhere. At checkout the next morning I asked them to hail a taxi and the lady said I needed to arrange that when I checked in. Never had that experience at a 5 star hotel. We seemed to be the only guests without a reserved taxi checking out as they were lining up and constantly in and out. They said it was too hard to hail one, which I can attest is quite true. And nobody helped my wife and I at all that morning get to the airport. In the end I just walked the long entrance driveway with my baggage to the main road and managed to get a taxi myself after waiting a long while. Definitely not how you want to start a travel day, grumpy as hell and late to the airport. In addition, at checkin we arrived late and hungry from a long flight. The bellhop refused to take our bags up, but strangely followed us to our room without the bags showing us the room like he wanted a tip. I told him in the lobby we are in hurry, were hungry, and Id just take my bags as their restaurant closes soon. But he insisted, plus I could not find them in the entrance so I guess they were moved? So we waited another 30 minutes from him to get our bags. Then to top it off the bellhop acted offended I didnt tip him, and just stood in our room after delivering the bags 40 minutes after we checked in. He literally ruined our night, theres no way Ill tip for that service. And Im the type to over tip, unless you seriously offended me. By that time their Thai restaurant that we asked about getting a reservation at checkin was closed unless we had a reservation. The staff there tried to get us in, but it was close to 10pm by then and the place was completely full. The guy at the desk at checkin told us to just walk in no reservation needed. So no dinner that night, as at that point we were too tired from traveling to find a place to eat, and I was frankly pretty upset and just wanted to go to sleep. I had researched the restaurant prior and was looking forward to dinner there. I should have made a reservation in hindsight well before we checked in, or one of us should have headed down there while the other waited for bags, as you could sense the bellhop was going to take his time with our bags. On the plus side the breakfast spread is nice, and what you expect. The rooms however are pretty small and just ok overall, especially for the price they were charging that night. Around 500. Maybe we got not such a great room? We did use a free Hyatt night, so thats quite possible. I will say I was impressed with their maintenance guys, as after getting back to the room failing to have dinner the AC wasnt working, which usually means youll have to change rooms in Southeast Asia, but they guy was there in 5 minutes, got up on a ladder and fixed it very efficiently. Complete pro. That was much appreciated at the point in our stay. We never got a chance to use the pool or checkout the grounds, but they looked nice in pictures before we booked. I had wanted to take a swim in the morning, but without a taxi arranged I was worried about getting to the airport on time. The last thing Ill say is this seems to be a business hotel, rather than a traveler hotel. Most of the people at breakfast were dressed for business meetings, and they had Fortune 500 type business meetings in their meeting rooms. The bellhops are also dressed very strangely here, Im not sure its the best look. Amazingly kind staff and service.
Spotlessly clean rooms.
Quite.
Good location with a very nice garden.
The hotel definitely deserves 5 stars. However, a few issues should also be noted as follows
Although breakfast selection is rich, there are still some problems.
Bread and baked stuff were served unfresh in the first 2 days. After my complaint, this problem was solved.
Some of the spa personnel are too pushy to sell spa services.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The hotel is a bit of a disappointment overall though for an autograph collection. Limited options and hours on food, very small lobby usually empty, mediocre pool, but still charging a hefty premium for Im not sure what. Rooms very small but beautiful. Just not great value for the price in Bangkok. But again, 1010 for customer service and employees who work here are great. We stayed at the Madi Paidi for 2 nights. The 5 boutique hotel is new and has only 56 rooms. Both the hotel and the breakfast are highly recommended. The rooms are furnished to a high standard, the beds are first class and the air conditioning is barely noticeable. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The location in Thonglor with the adjoining Ekkamai is excellent. Many great restaurants and nightlife in the area. We have already booked again for December. First try! I like the breakfast, yummy yet lots of variety.

As a titanium member, I was told that the suite is full and I am fine but then she said they already allowed me for early check in at 12pm something. Well speechless!

The pool is tiny and the room design is just average. Given the service from checkin and the location, I really dont think it match this price point! I love the concept of this hotel. I don't particularly like large, characterless 5 star hotels and hence the concept of this hotel really appealed to me. Unfortunately in this case the 'hardware' just does not live up to what's promised.....the staff and welcome is exceptional and all are very warm, but the hotel feels like it was originally designed for a budget property and spruced up later. The rooms are very cramped, parts of the hotel lift lobby are shockingly basic. For the price I paid, I was expecting a lot more, atleast a desk in my room to work on, but there just isn't enough place here. A pity cos the concept and staff are really very special. Such a wonderful hotel with service and facilities to match. On arrival we were greeted by the staff that showed real enthusiasm and professionalism to us. So rare and added to the feeling of arriving somewhere special and different in a truly nice way. We would like to mention especially Lek Wilaiporn for the first impressions and hotel information on checkin and all throughout Arno and Aommy from the restaurant, the service and food just like the place was just that extra special and had character. Roger for making us feel so welcome and checking everything was perfect. Lastly

I was planning to stay there to pamper myself, but it didn t happen. Hope i will someday. Before flight good place for relax and shower. Most masseuses are insincere and just trying to kill time.
Those who have time left...
Those who have money left over...
Even though it's expensive, I only recommend it to those who don't have anywhere to kill time.
There is no investment in facilities in this good location.
They don't even take care of the masseuse...
Are you leaving it like this?
It's just a shame It's a wonderful time!
Be careful because security is at risk !
Please use caution as security is risky.

It's a beautiful day.
What is the meaning of the story? There are 2 people in the group.
In the last few years, we have gathered together a group of young people. There are no such things as old people, so there are no such things as people in the world.
There are many things that will happen in the future.

I used it for sauna.
I had put my valuables and belongings in a locked locker, but someone opened the lock and stole my two credit cards.
I noticed this when I received a usage notification from my credit card company's app, so I called my credit card company and stopped using it. We also reported it to the nearby police station.
When I asked the sauna and hotel staff for assistance, they did nothing.

The pools, sauna, food, massage roomeverything is awesome. The restaurant prices were great, and the food was delicious. The owner is a super friendly guy who made me feel welcome as soon as I got there. Checking in was easy and simple. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Bangkok. Its like my 2nd home. Been coming here many times for a few years.

The uniqueness of this place is that it feels like a home, its cozy and you can meet other people both locals  internationals. The rooms are nice too with Netflix.

A very laid back atmosphere with good vibes. Wonderful hosts and staffs. Breakfast is personally prepared by the hosts themselves which is lovely. Have stayed in the accommodation previously however this time visited as a day visitor . Love what Dau and Gregers have created . However the best part is to enjoy a fabulous massage from Pen . Every day I went I always had a 2 hours massage . Pen provides a first class service . I have had many massages in Thailand however she is the best . Great sense of humour, great hands and technique. So if you are visiting BKK and would like to try something very unique and special then ring The Barefeet Resort and make a 2 hour massage booking with Pen  You wont regret it . Best wishes to all Tony Gday For many years the Barefeet has been our stopover in Bangkok both when we arrive from Europe or when we have to return.
We appreciate the kindness of the owners and staff, the breakfasts taken together, the swimming pool and its facilities.
Note that a new metro line now passes near the resort and greatly facilitates access to the city center. I had a really great time here.
Everything about it is awesome.
The beds are very comfortable. It has AC.  Two pools one cold and one warm.  I preferred the cold one but others gravitated to the warm one.  Probably cause it was close to lounge area.  Staff were great the owners awesome. Free breakfast every morning.  They even saved me mine when I slept in.  Highly recommended.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM

The room was spacious and very well equipped incl. iron facilities. The bed was comfortable, maybe would just ask to have also some smaller pillows.
The room service worked also well and the food was quickly prepared and it was delicious.
Breakfast was the best I have ever had.
Last but not least, I had a massage  recommend to everybody!
The stay was perfect and will come back when I am in Bangkok. Great location. Easy to get to and from the airport with a train station meters from the hotel.
The hotel is luxurious, clean and the staff are friendly and helpful!
The breakfast has a great selection of food and the dinning room is lovely.
The pool was refreshing and the gym was well equipped. I thought the hotel was in a great location, close to lovely shopping centres. I only stayed one night but wish I stayed longer, and would definitely stay here again. All of the staff were so helpful and polite. Dinner at La Vie restaurant was very nice. Unfortunately we got to breakfast just before it closed so had to rush it down, but it was of a high standard, better than most other hotels We had a very positive experience at VIE Hotel. Great location in Central Bangkok, close to the main shopping centres. Easy to reach via BTS. Friendly and helpful staff.
The bed was very large and comfortable, and could've easily accommodated another person on the bed. Location was super convenient gym also had lots of equipment which was good although difficult to book for classes due to limited spaces.

Room was very spacious and clean.

Had a hiccup when we checked in but service was excellent and they resolved it promptly.

The bar food was really good, and morning breakfast buffet was up to standard.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

They provided toilet items  soap, shampoo
The Breakfast is excellent

The only thing i deduct is because the sound but may be because the building material its self so it also affect the temperature during the day but if you stay out whole day it is fine. Otherwise, i would say it is perfect. For what I needed. A one night walking distance to the old dom. Airport in Bangkok... Clean quiet enough hot shower and working internet. Very cool small boutique hotel made from containers. Great value and overall the room is good but you can tell there's a smell from the bathroom. So I covered the drain for the shower and hopefully that will stop the smell. Acceptable if you're only staying for one night and need to be close to the airport.

Rooms are shipping containers with individual stairs no elevator and staff will not help you with your luggage.

Room seemed reasonably clean, except for the tea kettle which still had old water in it I never use hotel kettles anyway because they're almost always dirty and the bathroom had a strong sewage smell. There was a rip in the bedsheets that they put a tissue under to try and hide but they were otherwise clean.

There is a 500 baht deposit cash only that they require as a key deposit, which seems pretty outrageous, especially since no other hotel I've stayed at in Thailand has required this. They will refund it upon checkout.

Don Mueang Place Hotel is right down the street and 100 times nicer stay there instead. Acceptable if you are only staying for one night after before your flight.  There are dogs in the resort which will bark loudly at night, and may also bark at guests it wont be a big problem if you are okay with dogs, but if you are not that much okay with dogs, think twice.

My room is old but still acceptably clean.  Lack of privacy as the entrance is also the window for most rooms floor to ceiling glass  door.  If you open the curtains, people can see everything in your room including bed but except toilet.  If you close the curtains, then you have no light from the outside at all.   This wont be an issue for one night, but may be if more than that.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The food quality was outstanding, with generous portions and exquisite taste that truly highlighted the authentic design of each dish, from the appetizers to the main course.

There was an abundance of food, each dish beautifully crafted and delicious.

The service was excellent, with the staff demonstrating a friendly and attentive demeanor, making it one of the best luxury dining experiences I've had in Bangkok.

A special mention goes to Nu and Film, who took remarkable care of us on our special day, ensuring everything was perfect.

Their attentiveness and warm hospitality made the evening even more memorable.

I highly recommend Vertigo Too for a special occasion or a luxurious night out.

If you visit, I hope you're lucky enough to be looked after by Nu and Filmthey truly enhance the experience. Enjoy your time here!"" We came here for a special occasion and we are glad to say that this is the best experience we could ever imagine, since the beginning of our evening the stuff was on their best performance, no lies here!
Chet and Jack we highly appreciate all your effort and service made on this unbelievable day
View was perfect even on a rainy day.
Talking about service, everything is made on time, the stuff thinks about the comfort of the clients!
Good is amazingly delicious, highly recommend to try appetizers and main dishes, the desserts will surprise you too, we liked the one with lemon sorbet 
Thank you again, you made our evening memorable, especially the picture professionally taken on iPhone on a dark room
Music is not loud, which makes us able to talk and hear each other, genre is also chosen correctly. Incredible hotel overall but it is their staff that make the whole experience five star. We stayed three nights with our 7 year old child with club level access. The hotel itself is spectacular, our room was large, spacious and very comfortable. All the bars and restaurants offer a unique experience, all should be tried and the food is wonderful in each. The amenities such as the pool, gym and spa are beautiful and elegant and serve their purpose well. The club lounge drinks, food and service is second to none and the staff have nothing but smiles on their faces and want nothing but to make your experience with them the best it can be.
The personalized service, kindness and genuine interest in their guests in second to none. The team in club level looked after us in a way we didn't know we even needed. They could foresee our needs before we knew them. They cared greatly for our child and gifted her many personalized gifts that are very unique and meaningful that she will keep for many years to come. The team could not do any more to make this experience at this hotel any more special. I highly recommend this hotel and thank all that work there for their kindness. The hotel is quite nice.
Welcoming culture, the flowers, decorations, aromatics, color ensemble, everything is neat and in place.

However, the hotel seems a little older and might need a fresh up.
In our room were bugs, especially on the walls
Still not sure, what kind of bugs, very small tiny bugs.. unfortunately, we had to switch rooms, which meant packing again and was time consuming..

The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Special thanks to Annie Park, who took great care of us and was very attentive to manage the situation in the best manner possible.

Pool seemed a little smaller than expected, but I lived the Banyan tree products from the shop, which are great present items for friends and family. A Memorable Birthday Celebration on Saffron Cruise!

We recently celebrated a birthday on the Saffron Cruise by Banyan Tree, and it was an unforgettable experience. Our server, B, along with Uncle Lek, took such great care of us throughout the evening. They were incredibly attentive, ensuring that every detail was perfect, from the delicious food to the beautiful setting. Bs warm service and Uncle Leks thoughtful hospitality truly made our celebration extra special. We couldnt have asked for a better team to help make our day so memorable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a unique and delightful experience on the river!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Located at a very convenient place that is close to everything within walking distance. Tofu skincare, platinum mall, pratunam market. Safe place. The best thing about this place is the hospitality of the owner. They truly went up and above in ensuring you get the best experience. They changed my room immediately and upgraded the room due to aircond problem. They let us rest in the lobby while waiting for our evening flight. Truly the best place. Recommended! The location is best for shopping and near to center. But the room they offer you at more than 1100 Thai Bhat is not worth the money. The room is very small and has less facilities no wardrobe, no fridge. Only the location is woth staying here. Else, the room was small. No fridge. They switch off power to your room if they realize you have left duing the day and may not turn it on once you return back. The standard room was a lil bit small but still have windows. The service was good. The location was quite far from BTS station but close to central mall complex. It surrounded with night market and food court, which was so convenient. Tye Location of our hotel is so convenient. No need to ride ehailing to Platinum Mall, central world, Big C, and Pratunam Market. Very near to key locations.

Literally the nicest staff of all times. I had a weird situation with my flight not being confirmed and first they let me check in well in advance, then they let me check out in the evening and come back in later if I missed my flight which I did and on top of that they let me spend 5 hours at the pool after check out.
The room was basic but cosy and everything was working fine. Bed was comfy and actually very quiet inside the room considering how close to the airport. Will definitely come back here next time in Bangkok! Fairly close to BKK airport and is easy to find. Not offering airport transfer right now but short distance taxi was easy to get. We had a budget room so quite small. The air conditioning took most of the night to cool it down. Bed was comfortable and having the adjoining private bathroom was nice. Everything was reasonably clean and toiletries and water were provided. Coffee pot and fridge in the room. A good night. Pleasantly surprised by this hotel! I was a bit scared when I read some of the previous reviews but this hotel is actually perfect if you need to stay next to the airport and the price is very competitive.
We arrived late due to a delayed flight, did our check in around 1am and then left the next day early around 5am.
Room is nice, clean, bathroom works perfectly. It was quite even if you can hear some aircraft..but since you are near the airport it is expected. Reception was perfect and smooth.
It takes around 10min by cab to reach the hotel. You will find a 7Eleven a few meters away.
I recommend 100 This hotel was perfect for my first night in Bangkok. My flight arrived at 1am so I needed somewhere close to the airport for the first night. The room was clean and cooly air conditioned. The staff were lovely and really helpful, they even help me set up my Thai SIM card the next morning!","Monday: Open 24 hours

Not a chatty hostel  quite reserved and quiet. But the facilities are really nice and clean.

Overall a 55 experience. we stayed in a private room and a mixed dorm too. Everything is not nice even we stayed the private room the smell make us very dizzy and . The bedsheet also very old and its broken so many places this woman also not nice to talk with the customers . Shoes also need take off that place very disgusting smelly . I never write bad reviews to any hotels in my life but this place make us . Stay away from this hostel. The fat lady in front desk not good . They charge extra money for the bedsheets even can remove  scars . The room is as what they described. I paid 1008 THB for 2 nights, king bed still bunk bed is spacious for 2 people. Except the smell of shoes and toilets which actually contributed by all the guests including us, then it's fine regarding the price. You have a bed in a center, the staffs are nice and helpful once you ask for help, i do not ask more for what i paid. Me and my friend are staying only one night, for me the good quality of sleeping is number one but then youll know why i give pro cons below

Pro
super convinience location
communal space
have electric kettle and cuttleries

Cons 
That isnt bed!! its based bed without Mattrass and very hard. my back as hurt as i was stay in room  102  They charge 2 times 1000 bath deposit if you stay 2 people in the room its going to be difficult with just one key.
 not having refil mineral water
 the towel one is clean one is kinda old one Very uninterested staff, when I arrived there, I politely asked to the receptionist about possibility for early checkin, she said no, fully booked last night, immediately even before thinking. Bedding was reallystained yellow all over the pillow, oh well they put the pillow into the pillowcase 2hrs later I checked in. Staircase on the ground floor smells like a cat litter box, shower was almost about to flooded when I took a shower. Only pros of this hostel would be affordable price and location I guess.","Monday: Open 24 hours

There are a few adorable cats in the shop, which make the place feel really cozy. The environment is very quiet, and theres no noise at night, making it perfect for a restful sleep. Privacy is great, with curtains for each bed, so you wont be disturbed. They also provide lockers for storing valuables, which is a thoughtful touch. The space is clean and comfortable, and considering the price, its definitely great value for money. Highly recommend! I consider myself lucky to have picked this place. Most convenient is that they offer luggage locker the size of a large backpack, with an extra tray on top for commonly used stuff. It was nice to leave my backpack there while I adventured. Also the locker key ring has a keycard to open the front door after hours. The bunk area is Extremely quiet and they have curtains in each bunk for complete privacy. Light and outlet in each bunk too. Showers and bathrooms were cleaned everyday, and each day I noticed someone sweeping and taking care of the floors. It is an amazing place, and their dedication and service is beyond compare. Good WiFi too. The cat is cute also. We've had a lovely 3 night stay here in both the king size bedroom and the 2bed bedroom. We got the first room by mistake and had to switch on the second night, but the host apologized a lot and gave us free coffee. Both rooms were clean and nicely decorated.

I told them and they remade my bed, but they are everywhere so it didn't solve the problem of course. In general, the place was badly equipped. The shower heater was turned off and a lot of the chairs on the roof terrace are broken.

The food in the cafe is good and has a reasonable price, but I really can't recommend staying there BEDBUGS ALL OVER THE PLACE !

If you spot any,  ask for a refund immediately!
This is your right, it's Thailand not Sudan mate!
This is unacceptable and probably illegal to put people's health at risk like this!!

I put one star 'coz I couldn't put zero!!
BEDBUGS!!! All over the ENTIRE place!
I just noticed some on my pillow when I went to sleep, my roommates noticed few of them walking freely on every backpacks in the room!
Plus people have noticed many of them on sofa and pillows at the rooftop.
So you can guess the amount of them in the building already!
Do not waste your time reporting it 'coz I already did and you can see they don't care at all clearly, they just tell you the official answer like,
""We gonna have a look, thanks""
But you can feel the,
""Not my problem, I just want your money and I never gonna see you again anyway""
You can also notice on the reviews that people complained about the exact same thing 7months ago already, so I let you imagine how big the population grew since  
Just a quick reminder though 
Bedbugs are able to carry dangerous diseases for humans like Lyme disease for example and infect anything with their bites, they're feeding themselves with blood so the transmission is actually really easy...

So it's actually so unprofessional and disgusting to let people in, when you are perfectly aware of the serious situation..
Such a shame!
Staff and management are awful to keep things that way and act like everything's normal.
I'll never come back and give money to those irresponsible people..
It's just crazy what people are willing to do for money like! Terrible! They have bed bugs! Dont sleep there if you dont want to have new small friends in your backpack and bites on your body.

When we realized we are bitten we told staff about it, but they didnt care at all. It was just bed bugs? Okay. Not worth this low price at all as you need to spend twice this price on laundry then. Ive already seen UNHCR refugee camps that looked better than this. The stink of the rooms were so bad that I didnt even bother spending a night in this hell hole. I wouldnt even advise my worst enemy to sleep there honestly. A mass grave is more appropriate to stay at The location of the hostel is awesome and very central just very near and opposite to a thai government office and just a 500 metres walk from the democracy monument on the main road the place is very lively with a krit food joint serving rice and very delicious vegetables and non veg items and the convenient of the hostel location is its 2 7 eleven stores located within a 100 metres away is a suggested pro for solo backpackers and traveller's the most lively night attraction of thailand I.e the khaosan place orstreet is just 800 metres away the staff are very friendly and they had a nice rooftop that serves a place to mingle with strangers and friends as well as party the hostel beds are very spacious but the room doors and entry is a bit narrow and restricted....there is a night shift duty staff named cinnamon who is very friendly and try to help you as much as she can....the vibe of the place is magnetic as well as charismatic the place is a well maintained equilibrium of residential houses and commercial activities....just a good environment for kids solo backpackers adults old etc....and the price doesn't burn a hole in your pocket....mostly under 400 baht for one night",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The only downside was that the metal frames on the beds were transparent mesh so you didn't get a lot of privacy. Apart from that everything was  The location was prime with 7Eleven across the road, loads of cheap places to eat and only a short distance to the bars.
Everyone was on a good vibe.
The pub crawl was 380 baht and came with a tank top and drink, and a mystery shot at each bar.
I joined the walking Tour for 150 baht, which the guides lead very well. Extra informative and comes with a beer at the end.
Overall a great experience, I highly recommend . Best place for Solo backpacker you will meet a different tourist daily from different countries. Its hub station for tourists. They conduct a program daily, like sometime city tour, pub crawl, canal tour etc. Ive enjoyed a lot with Nadia and Kate as a tour guide and they explained each thing very clearly its a great tour for me. Thankyou so much mad monkey and special thanks to Nadia and Kate for conducting everything super smooth.  Couldnt dream of a better way to start our Thailand trip! All of the staff were incredible, creating a great atmosphere for both winding down and getting wound up for a night on the town. Shoutout to Connor and Win for some of the most memorable nights Ive had, and to Nadia for showing us the beauty that lies in every corner of this great city. If I ever get a chance to come back to Bangkok, I hope theres still room to stay at this hostel. Great location  walking distance to walking street, The rooms and washrooms were well maintained. And reasonably price.
They also organise fun events in the evenings. The day we were there they had a pub crawl planned in the walking street. It was a lot of fun!!!
Overall a great place to stay. Great Chinatown Tour with Nadia

We had a fantastic time exploring Chinatown with Nadia as our guide. She shared rich history and stories that made the area come alive. Nadia also recommended some delicious vegetarian food options, which we really appreciated. Her passion and knowledge made the tour both fun and informative. Highly recommend!","Monday: Open 24 hours

I have stayed in many hostels at this price range in my travels and I have never encountered anything as bad as this. The bathrooms are filthy and the beds are shaking all night long. But this is not important, it is worth the price. They will turn the aircon on fan mode during the day until 830pm then they will change it to cool mode for you. During the day you have to endure the heat like hell. If you want to rest during the day, this is not the place to be. Usually many hostels I have stayed in only turn the aircon on for 24 hours a day to let the machine rest. This one did not turn it off at all. During the day, they changed the cool mode to fan mode. They think that stupid travelers like us would not notice. But the worst thing is the dorm staff. They act like we are staying for free. If you really need to stay here, do not ask them anything. You will not get an answer or you will be annoyed. The only good thing about this place is that there is a rooftop to get some cool air. It offers competitive prices compared to other places in Bangkok. However, my experience was mixed. The hostel looks different from the photos initially used for advertising and is a bit unclean. The hostel feels old, and the kitchen and toilets need better maintenance. I stayed in a lower bunk bed in a 4bed dormitory room, which was unpleasant and had an odor. The main advantage is its convenient location, just a 6minute walk to BTS On Nut station. The rooms are very dirty, Have a musty smell, the receptionist's service is the worst. It's like you're not satisfied with the service. People who come to stay smoke cigarettes and marijuana. Causing a foul smell throughout the hotel, No parking, Services room will be provided only on the first day  only of stay. All employees speak impolitely, This is poor if you low class you sleep in the hotel Absolutely abysmal. There was a guy with sleep apnea in the bed below me I begged them to move me but they didn't luckily they did give me a refund for the remaining days. Just writing this I am very grateful I am not still there rn the vibe of the place is very negative.

The bathroom and rooms in generel were very clean.  It's a nice place to have some conversations with your roommates. The common areas were also great. We recommend it sincerely  The advantages are that the staff are very friendly and caring, there are many public activity and rest spaces, you can directly see the cruise ships on the river, and the environment is very clean. The disadvantages are just for me. I may not like some Internet celebrity attractions, but I found that the residents here like these nostalgic streets. There are artworks on the walls, everyone is taking pictures and selfies, and you can see the boats on the river, and there is a cool breeze blowing. I also met a family with children living here. Really liked this hostel, the staff was AMAZING but the cleaners need to do better... our private room floor was not cleaned before we got there. Overall nice stay but would have been way better if cleaners cleaned the floor . I will say as a hostel thought I didn't stay in the bunks, looks awesome. There is so much ceiling space in each bunk. Ceilings are super high!

Sunsets on the deck are the best too! Amazing view  This is the best hostel I've ever stayed.

Good point
Everywhere in the hostel is so clean.
There are some relax spaces. Sofa and cushion are comfy.
Bed room is enough big to get a good sleep.
Front staff is talkative, kind, and friendly.

Negative point
Nothing, but it's better to use Grab when you go back to the hostel at night.
Because the road of getting there is so dark and no people. Amazing hostel with the kindest staff! Bathrooms are shared but very clean! And the deck overlooking the river is a great plus! We had a private room with amazing view from our window.

Only point of improvement could be that the private room we stayed at had no curtains! So in the moring a lot of light got in!","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

CheQinn Hostel Sukhumvit 4,"21, 10 Sukhumvit Rd, Khwaeng Khlong Toei, Khet Khlong Toei, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand",3.5,13.7400684,100.5535278,"It's a dive, but it's an affordable dive close to downtown. When we got to our private room we asked that they clean our air conditioning filters since they were dirty. The bed was pretty damn hard, shower had weak pressure and not a lot of hot water. They do not take credit cards, which was a drag since we got there directly from the airport so had to find a nearby ATM.

The internet sucked, wouldn't stay on very long at all, and we only stayed for a few days, which was probably long enough. It was better the second day we were there, but we got home after being gone all day to find a wet floor! No evidence of a leak, and we suspect it may have come up from the floor. Either way, the room was just a place to sleep and shower and no more. The only advantage is location and low price. But due to low price, the customers are mostly lowincome visitors who are likely to disobey the dorm rules. The female receptionist is friendly, though, the male receptionist does not meet the most fundamental job requirement , which is being polite to customers. He showed no kindness and explicitly expressed discriminatory and baseless opinions of customers, I dont like him. Also, the facility and rooms are not clean at all. There is even dog poop on the floor. The showers and restrooms are as dirty as if it had not been cleaned for several days. So, unless you have no other option, you can and you should definitely choose any other accommodation. This was one of the filthiest and saddepressing places I've ever stayed.

I think it's some kind of long term stay arrangement for workers and working girls.

On arrival it wasn't clear which bed was supposed to be mine as they all looked slept in, when they figured it out, they made the bed but  with the same sheets. I asked to changed the sheets which they did, kudos. The sheet was washed but still dirty. Still good enough to reuse I suppose.

The shared bathroom was a flooded mess. Nowhere has a place to hang clothes or towels. Any surface that wasn't wet, was filthy. Sticky with dust.

To get to the hostel you pass through a seedy neighborhood full of bars for the lonely. So if that's what you're looking for, I guess it's a great location.

The rooms are dark and dank. they smell of stale cigarettes and alcohol. No suprise given the area of the hostel.

The pictures are at least 10 years and a hard time older.

The wifi worked for a whole 10 minutes before giving up,

This was a teachable moment for me to always ask to see the room before paying.

My roommates were extremely impolite. A drunk dude's phone just kept ringing all night. This isn't the staff's fault, but sure managed to prevent me from getting any sleep.

As I lay there wondering where I went wrong, I realised someone would have to pay me a hefty sum for me to redo that night. The thought of having paid money for the privilege of such a horrible experience brings me to anger. No good room dirty. We book good room after we reach in hotel they give us not same we book. And they let the dog come with u all staff only looking at uU cannot even stay 1 day to sleepBad service and u cannot cancel ur booking.we lost money Location is very good, near Nana Bts ,only 400m walk.

But it is some bugs in the room and the toilet without door. Luckily i am travel alone, not feel embarrassed.

Hence, three star is the max i can give.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Met A Space Pod @Phrom Phong,"24/4 Soi Sukhumvit 35, Khwaeng Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand",4.7,13.7349331,100.5699962,"Great experience. Staff is so friendly, the pods are very clean and comfortable. I was surprised how soft the sheets and pillows were.

The only thing I wish was better was the bathroomshower situation. The toilet and shower is very tiny, so everything is wet all the time, and it just felt exhausting trying to change clothes without getting everything wet, as there is only a tiny little towel rack to put everything on.

Also, location is a bit far from the main road, so it's kind of a walk to get anywhere.

Overall, great value for the price! And you get to visit Yoda! So much great place to be for a good sleep and a funny experience ! With 5min from bts so easily walk. There is from 8 to 10am a quick and free breakfast, free water and coffee all time, i really recommended this nice place to stay in a capsule of space !
Bathroom and toilets are outside for a better sleep, only dorm and lockker in the room, some are small for 500bath and bigger one for 700bath with the tv. You can charge your electronique stuff by usb... There is 247 receptionist available and I was able to check in around midnight no problem. The rooms are nicely air conditioned and the pods are spacious and clean. There is good ventilation and surprisingly decent sound insulation. You are given 2 pairs of headsets to use with the smart TV in your pod. The lockers provide plenty of storage, but big suitcases might not fit. The pod has 2 USB charging ports, but no regular outlet, so I couldn't charge my phone because my charger only had USBC connections. I had to check out too early for breakfast, but it looked like they had some small pastries and toast with jam and milk. If you are budget tourist, you definitely visit this place which with comfortable rooms and friendly, English speaking staffs.
7am  10am has simple breakfast offer, but I wake up to late cant show the picture. The perfect spot to stay if youre enjoying Bangkok on a budget and have fun staying in quirky places! The group that works onsite are so friendly and the pods and overall facilities are very clean! Weve actually stayed 4 different times when traveling to Bangkok because its near public transit and not expensive at all! Highly recommend to travelers! Ps they have two cute kitties that love to play with guests! ",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Kinnon Hostel,"39 Si Lom Rd, Khwaeng Silom, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand",4.7,13.728329,100.5296789,"The best hostel ever. Stayed there first time in 2019 if i remember correctly, after that in 2020, 2022, 2023. It is clean, close to everything, best AC ever, curtains on each bed, quiet during night time, a room with a big TV, working space, coffee place downstairs. Miss u, guys! Hope to see u again soon! Checkin was a breeze  the reception staff are very friendly and accommodating. Location is great, with a convenient selfservice laundry and numerous massage parlors nearby. They also offer local meals, but I didnt get to try them as the kitchen closes every Saturday bummer!. The rooftop garden is a nice touch.

One major annoyance would be the cleaning, which sometimes starts much earlier than 11, causing noise and clutter. Staff would also sit on the stairs and sigh when asked to move, barely making space. This place is cosy and nice, with friendly staff who really care. The bed is spacious and cosy, and everything is very clean. It feels like home.

Some issues There's no hot water in the shower, and after a cool shower you have to go back to a freezing room. My bed was under the AC, set at 24 degrees all the time. They couldn't change it because others might feel hot, but they gave me a free extra blanket usually 100 baht. One staff member even came back after at night, from her home, to give it to me.

The internet is okay but might not be enough for work. The coworking space is nice but can be noisy. But I put 5 star because of the girl who did everything she could to help me.  Great place for a good price I mean affordable. Rooms were clean and comfortable and spacious, with all basic amenities lockers, cloth stand, table with storage, chairs and sofa, hair dryer, cups, clean linen, room slippers and towels are provided  no coffee or boiler in the rooms though. Shared washrooms are also kept clean, with shampoobath gel provided for showers. There's a gamereading shared room, and an open area on the terrace to chill or sip on beer. You also get really good food options for a great price! Location is really good, lots of places to eat and shop, close to the market and metro walkable easily. Coffee and tea options are available all time at the common kitchen mostly same for all hostel stays but worth mentioning. You can expect people from various countries on your visit here, and you might get to know a lot about them if you are a talker! Overall, great experience with our stay here. LOVED IT! I was there for about 3 days. They have really cool bunkbeds in a small room and really neat toilets. The people are super friendly and they have an amazing lobby and a co working space. Its right in the city so no need to worry about travelling farther from the road deep. As soon as you reach the main road, you will have bus stops and metro stations nearby. You have an option for breakfast as well.  Just make sure that you dont make any noise if you come in late as the other people will be sleeping at night and if you plan on setting alarms in the morning, make sure your turn it off quick lol.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM

However, Very clean, bathroom is continuously cleaned and the room was clean and cool.
Beds were hard but there was ample space in your bunk.
The two male workers on the front desk could have been a little more welcoming and friendly.
A good base for exploring Bangkok if you are with a travel buddy already group!
The tea, coffee and free sandwiches was great. This is actually a fantastic hostel! Great value too! It's nice and quiet as well, far enough away from the busyness. That's possible to get a good night's sleep. The rooms are also very quiet and nice as well. They give you curtains and you have your own kind of like capsule to sleep in and store your belongings in as well. I really really felt relaxed here.

Plus all the staff are young and nice and friendly and encouraging to all of the guests. It almost feels like the staff are like guests themselves with cool stories and they're always down to hang out. Honestly, I wish I had spent more time here but there's always next time.

I think of any real downside other than the fact that the hallways weren't airconditioned. Not really that big of a deal honestly. Oh and there's also super cool rooftop lounge area to hang out in too too. Great place to rest in busy Bangkok.
It's not a party hostel, but I did not have any trouble meeting new people as a solo traveler.
The staff is amazing, their English is very good and they're always up for a little chat.
I don't know who came up with the ""free sandwiches"" but he or she deserves a statue. The big fridge downstairs is always stacked with sandwiches, which might run the 7 eleven tosti out of business.
It's a very stylish hostel with a great atmosphere. The rooms are spacious and the beds provide a lot of privacy. Every bed had a little shelf for your bag and a locker for personal items. Really well thought out. The best hostel in the galaxy. The staff are so friendly  helpful, the daily toursactivities are a plus  the rooms are absolutely brilliant  feels more like a japanese capsule hotel but with a super strong communal vibe which I love. I met lots of amazing  lovely people here. Only thing I can fault it on is a couple of the showers are a bit dodgy but this didn't detract from my stay for a second. See you when I come back to play music on the roof! Its a lovely hotel with really good services and super helpful and friendly staff. However there are three key things that let it down a bit for me.

But first, there was generally good upkeep, good vibes and cleanliness. They have a chill lounge, a welcome area and a kitchen with free egg mayo sandwiches in the fridge! Also they seem to organise occasional social tour stuff, but not the party kind.

But now I want to draw attention to the three letdowns, the first of which is an important factor for me when deciding a hostel

1  the mattress is pretty hard a common thing in SEA, but there are softer mattress dorms around. And it had a plastic surface which you could feel through the sheet.

2  small locker  luggage storage space.  you need your own lock for the storage. A small backpack can barely fit in it. Also there isnt much space to store larger luggage, especially in the 4 bed dorm and Im not talking about the locker now.

3  the AC in the room turns off at 11am not sure when it comes back on. Again this is pretty common in SEA but maybe something to keep in mind if youre jet lagged and planning to nap as there are hostels that keep it on.

Bonus 4  gotta pay 50baht to rent a towel, not a big deal but so you know

Overall its a lovely hostel, but those three can be bothersome if theyre important to you so Id just like to point them out as it hasnt really been mentioned in reviews before. I wouldve given 3 stars because of those personal issues, but the free egg sandwiches gave it a bump. What can I say, I guess I can be bribed after all.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The bathroom was very disgusting and there was no hot water. The guests staying were of poor quality. Booked here for adventure and fled at midnight. The deposit was 100 baht. The owner did not return me. Very bad. I made the worst booking I have never made.
Do NOT come to this place please.
The rooms arent clean. Also you feel like you are in a bunker with a lot of people and you dont have space to leave your luggage in your room.
It smells bad. The bathroom arent clean.
Everything bad.

I made a booking for 2 nights and the first night I leave to another hostel without caring the spent money. Ive never done something like this. People are nice, location is good because of the good hostels and one coffeeshop around, but this place is a mess. Cheap and dangerous, have to admit.

Won't come back. I compared with other same price hostel nearby, this hostel is .
Rooms are very poor.
AC also poor and they don't even have Remote control for AC.
Every guest must remove our shoes at the ground floor but No flipflop or slipper for Sharing toilet use. Toilet is poor too.
No Towel. No Rug.
When they wash the toilet area, those dirty water flows into the room. It's disgusting.
I shared some photos too. Do not come to this place. I repeat DO NOT. I know sometimes one reads bad reviews and says okay, maybe they are used to fancy places and this wasnt enough for their palate. Nop. I have slept in any kind of hotel, hostel, airports, tents, the car park of a gym inside a small car. This place is smelly, dirty, and with really shady people. Theres no privacy in the rooms, people see you sleeping and decide its time to watch a video at full volume or start singing. I only spent a few hours there to take a shower and leave my bags in between trips but I would tell my past self to just DONT.

I stayed in August 2024 in 12 bed room. It is big and bright room with high ceilings

Overall stay was okay, clean and fresh, but there are suggestions to improve
 Not enough hooks and shelfs in toilets, in bathroom and wash basin
 Bathroom and toilets were clean, but old and required renovations
 Some lockers in toilets were broken
 No place for luggage inside the room
 No curtains in the bed
 Needed some shelf inside the bed to put some phone or other stuff

A little bit of renovations and improvements, it will be a great place to stay. It is a beautiful old building with gorgeous wooden windows and balconies and a lot of greenery. Very cozy, quiet and atmospheric This Place needs lot of repair and maintenance work in bathrooms. Also staff training. The guy in the reception has attitude and no respect to customers. He talks as though we are his childhood friends. Yes the places is most reasonably priced in Bangkok clean sheets and peaceful nights. Just the staff attitude need to change. You have to pay additionally for everything here, even the blanket. You have to leave the deposit. You can not eat your food ? It's a hostel, not a restaurant.
I was in a hurry and wanted to check out early but had to wait until 8.15
The staff wasn't very helpful. They didn't show me the room.
I think they might not change the bedsheets The staff were lovely, however, Bodega is advertised as a party hostel, it is not, it is cheap accom in Bangkok for people of all ages, not just backpackers. No blanket included so beware you have to pay 79baht extra for this. Also not free drinking water and a big water costs 50baht!! Bathrooms quite dirty and mixed male and female. It's a cheap stay and does the job but I would say as a female, it didn't feel the safest, especially if you travel solo I would not recommend. Beware of Fake reviews before you book here !

Totally a mess once I landed here at the Bodega.. Receptionist was kind enough.. Service was fair.. The moment I stepped into the room, I was terribly disappointed. They don't give u blankets. You have to rent it for 75 baht which is quite strange.. they give you a towel though . The cots need quite a lot of maintenance as it'll give you creeping sounds even for the smallest of the movements you make while sleeping.. But that isn't a problem as you will however not sleep  because of the super loud tuktuk fan and the never cooling ACs. It couldn't get any worser as they didn't have curtains to cover the bed.. its just open like you belong to everybody.. toilets and shower In the ground floor only... Outdated ones.. broken hooks... Very petite.. hot water available.. no shower gel. No body wash... Uff, I wish I didn't book here.. I wanted to run away from there when I woke up and rushed to the reception at 6 30am only to sit outside until 8am when the staffs come in to open the restaurant where the reception is operated ...",no operation time,"lodging, bar, point_of_interest, establishment"

But the neighbours were out at 2.30 a.m., setting up the local market that's on the doorstep of the hostel, so sleep was irrelevant.
The market is very convenient for breakfast but not convenient for sleep.
The place was locked when I arrived, but the staff quickly came to let me inside.
It was clean and smelt fresh.
Firm bed and nice pillow. Location is very convenient, including going to DMK airport. Market is just near door. Room is clean and airconditioned. Bed is clean and wide and towel is provided. Wifi is good and have small locker for your valuabls. Only 1 toilet for each floor and 2 showersno hot water. Booked it for Us6 and definitely is value for money. Recommended! I had a great experience staying at this hostel. They are still very new, but are doing a great job. The staff drove us to the airport during a massive tropical storm and didnt ask for money, however I insisted and tipped 100 baht. Highly recommend this place if you want to stay somewhere for a good price near the airport. Great place with reasonable price! Room is newly renovated so its clean and beautiful.

I used the private room and it had all the basics and the bed the was comfortable. I only stayed for 2 nights but it was a good experience. Also the workers were cool and helped when they could. Oh and if you enjoy marijuana this is the place for you! This was my first time staying in a hostel, my experiences about the rooms was really uncomfortable to me. I paid for 3 nights from Oct3 Oct 6, 2024 but I only stayed one night.
When I check in the hostel at oct 3, the process of check in was really cool. But the rooms I used to stay is really bad like awful smell, tiny dark room with no blankets, unsafe for personal items. The website used to advise they have safe locker to store luggage and personal items but actually they only have small locker without any keys. I visited around Khaosan and the hostel location is pretty great. The decoration also got chilling vibe. When I came back to my bed after visiting Khaosan, there was a woman sitting on my bed and she is speaking and laughing without any reasons by looking at me with the man over my dorm bed. So, I need to add an imformation that they don't have any privacy for travellers who staying in hostel.
After that I slept with no blankets and next day i checked out.

When I checked out, the receptionist who was Nawri is really nice and friendly. She have a lovely smile and always ready to help. My check out process is pretty smooth. She did her responsibilities really quick and she asked me why I checked out early and what made me uncomfortable. She is really great upon following up for the guests needs.

Hostel location  3star, Great
Rooms  1 star, awful
Service  Friendly, smooth, If i could give this place a 0 i would .
The place reaks of cigarettes and weed .
The bed in the dorms didnt stop moving of the slightest movements.

It moved so much i woke up dizzy and sick!
You need to ask for a blanket which was not enough to cover my whole body im 172 and in our room the air conditioning was taped to the celling .

You can find so much better value in other places . Staying at this hostel was an unsettling experience, and I would not recommend it, especially for solo female travellers. From the moment I checked in, I felt uncomfortable. Eddie, the staff member who checked me in, made a series of inappropriate comments that left me feeling uneasy. His behaviour was creepy, and instead of feeling welcomed, I felt unsafe right from the start.

Overall, this was a distressing experience, and I strongly advise others to avoid this hostel, particularly if you are travelling alone.

I had initially booked 7 nights at this hostel, hoping that my first impressions might improve. Unfortunately, after a dreadful first night, it only got worse. Eddies creepy comments and behaviour during checkin were just the beginning. I tried to give it a chance, but the overall sense of unease made it impossible to stay any longer. I checked out the very next day and can honestly say I wouldnt wish a night here on my worst enemy. Avoid this place at all costs. Whoops, I wish I read the Google reviews before booking on Hostel world. Yeah all of the reviews talking about the rude Chinese owner guy are right. I had a run in with him too and he was so rude commenting on my Chinese last name and criticizing me for not being able to speak Chinese, plus other random garbage but I zoned out once he started going on about nonsense. Crazy enough this is the second time a hostel owner worker has made this exact comment to me. If I had a nickel... Anyways, just stay somewhere else, all the reviews talking about bad service unless it's the female receptionists, smell of weed, drugs, dirty rooms, etc. They're all pretty accurate.

Update to owner's response I unfortunately stayed here, anyone who even glances at my profile can tell I am traveling. I think it is a bit strange that the owner states they fired the only quality about this hostel that I found redeeming.",no operation time,"cafe, lodging, store, food, point_of_interest, establishment"

The rooms were cozy, bathrooms wellequipped, and the location next to the night market was perfect. The staff were incredibly kind, even letting me use the shower after checkout. The only downside was the firm mattress, but overall, it's a fantastic choice for travelers. 1010 value for money, you sleep in the city center with very low noise for that area. Private room have good AC unit, which is important in Bangkok. Clean room, pleasant staff. 4th floor is no problem for us, but might be for some I was being informed that my booking by Agoda is being cancelled by the hostel when I arrived at the front desk with my extremely tired body today. Ridiculous ! If you like this happened to you, try booking this Hostel.
One thing is the young girl at the front desk is very polite and helpful, I told her that wasn't her mistake. Very calm place, close to food market, night market, Lumpini park and MRT. Working space area with free water, coffee, tea and mangos. Everything is clean and works well. The owner is very kind, I highly recommend ! Excellent hostel. The location was pretty good. Everything you need is close by. The price is low  but the amenities are 10 points  clean room, air conditioning.","Monday: 8:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Had a very good experience, the crew is so friendly and nice. Rooms are clean and comfortable. They give you a towel and theres already shampoo and a shower gel in the shower which is great.. You get a nice locker that should be just enough. Anyway I recommend on bringing your own lock in case it wont be enough.
The location is great couldnt ask for better one and mutual area is nice and comfortable
Strongly recommend very good experience! I had an absolutely fantastic stay at this hostel. From the moment I arrived, the staff were very friendly. They were always knowledgeable and very fun to talk.

The atmosphere was vibrant and welcoming  a bright place where people were easy to meet, chat, and connect with.

The facilities were wellmaintained and clean, with common areas kept tidy. The lockers provided were a nice addition for keeping personal items secure.

The location is great for spending a few days in Bangkok. Its perfect for getting your bearings and exploring the main attractions. The hostels staff is incredibly helpful in guiding you through this process.

Special thanks to Win, Jinn, Harry, and the rest of the team for making my stay so enjoyable!

Overall, I couldnt have asked for a better place to stay. I would highly recommend this hostel to anyone looking for a welcoming, social, and comfortable place to stay. I hope to see everyone in the future  Best hostel Ive ever stayed at. Very social and a great community of travelers. All the staff are very kind and helpful. Yoga class everyday for free. Events by the hostel that take you into town every day of the week. The capsules you sleep in are very nice. I wish more hostels had that system it makes going to sleep way easier and its harder to get woken up by people coming in at 5am. AC turns off at 11am which will get you out of bed, but I think that is proper to get you out exploring and meeting people, which is what traveling is all about. Would recommend to anyone its a very safe and fun place to stay! Truly lived up to its ""exceptional"" rating as a great hostel in a great location. Have traveled extensively around the world  stayed at many hostels  Khaosan Social is one of my favorites. Unassuming entrance from the street takes U oddly through an Indian restaurant, but hostel reception upstairs is warmly welcoming, the place is kept very clean, wristband fob for doorslockers is great,  bunk capsules are immaculate, comfortable  welldesigned in perfectly airconditioned rooms. No surprise this place is heavily booked 100 worth it! Special kudos to Burmese front staff member Win whose passionate love  hope for his troubled homeland is truly touching. Here's hoping Myanmar enjoys peace ahead soon! 5 stars all around. Would give it 6 if I could. The team is absolutely phenomenal. Sunny, the owner built this place from the ground up and poured his heart, and soul into every aspect of the place. You can really tell. The location couldnt be better and the rooms are so well taken care of, cleaned everyday by their custodial team who are all so sweet and accommodating.

We played bingo and had a good chat. Def a great place to stay if you looking for an affordable hostel with good vibe. Much love x had such a good stay at the hostel, the rooms were clean and the beds really comfortable. The staff was super nice and helpful and there was always someone at the reception for any questions! perfect location to explore bangkok  What a wonderful stay! The hostel has only been open for a week but already has an incredible vibe, 24 hour reception, great playlists, games and just general goodness. Well air conditioned common area and dorms and the beds are extremely comfortable. All the staff are really lovely and Carly the owner was super accommodating and helpful during my stay. Will be coming back next time Im in Bangkok, for sure! Great hostel, amazing prices for the stay and the bar downstairs. Would highly recommend if you want to see Bangkok and Khasoan road. Amazing vibe and so chill to relax in.

Additionally the staff here were world class and they really care about the people who stay in their hostel. They offer a bus to the airport at many times for 220 bhat which is a very good price also . I must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish.It boasts a picturesque setting that is both peaceful and captivating. Providing a perfect backdrop for a relaxing getaway. It's conveniently located, yet feels like a secluded paradise away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The resort's amenities were topnotch.

Very basic with a nice rooftop to chill out on. The AC in the room was turned off for a portion of the day. Everything was clean.
The beds weren't the most comfy.
The location was good and not too far to The shops or a few bars.
Probably my own fault but I was a bit bored at this hostel.
I wasn't a fan of all the fines attached to the rules, seemed a bit excessive see attached
Not bad for the price though. Small little heaven in the middle of the busy city of Bangkok. Im so lucky to find this gem.
The staffs are all very helpful, Sue and Jay are always have this beautiful smile and ready to help and answer all your possible questions about Bangkok.

The shared bathrooms and toilets are always kept clean and well attended. Shared rooms dorm are all cleaned everyday. Price are really reasonable compared to other hostels around, from the lovely staffs to the cleanliness and safety this hostel stand up 100 better than other hostel in sukumvit.

I love Revolution! Definitely be back!

Thank you so much! Stayed there for a whole week.
The highlight is definitely the rooftop terrace and the super nice staff. All the people are really chill and its easy to socialise. The rooms and showers are nothing special but totally fine. Showers and toilets get cleaned every morning. Overall everything 55 also the location is nice as well, close to Terminal 21 and the MRT line.
Special shout out to Sue who always tries to get you to extend one more night and buy more beer  Actually good hostel ,clean room,good location.
However be careful. You have to pay a key deposit 500 and early morning there is nobody so I mean I couldn't get back my money.
Also early morning you can't use the sharing space included fridge. If you put something in the fridge,you can't pick it up.

In the end, the hostel is not allowed to bring outside alcohol. Nice and lovely reception. All of them are very helpful and very kind. Clean room and shared bathroom and toilets. Very lovely rooftop if you just want a chill and quiet night this is the place for you. Located 10mb a walk from mrt and 15 mins walk from BTS, cafes everywhere and restaurants plus if you like to party. The hostel is very secure and safe for solo travelers like me.

Will definitely recommend this place. Will be back soon with my friends.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 12:00 AM

The dorm I was staying in was big and as I had the bed next to the windowbalcony, I could get some fresh air in the morning, which was great. The bathrooms are nice and you have a chill area on the 1st floor. I liked it that everyone had to take off their shoes after entering the door to the 2nd floor. The cleaning lady was very present and the staff's funny dog was definitely a plus haha 

But
I've been travelling for 10 months now and this was the coldest hostel ever lol The ac in the dorms should really be set to at least 23 degrees. The staff I was talking to about this tried to help but they said there would always be guests complaining and changing the settings themselves, therefore they keep the controler for the ac with them. Like.. I understand that they can't make everyone happy but it doesn't have to be a winter wonderland. Same in the lobby.
The location of the hostel is not the best. Nothing really nice to explore and quite far from the hotspots. But there's one cheap restaurant in walking distance Tom's Caf that offers good local breakfast, lunch, dinner. Would be nice if the hostel would create a list with spots like this. I had to find it myself as they didnt have any recommendations. Amazing hostel, worth the price.
The amenities are good and the staff is nice.
Had wonderful moments there. One of the best hostel I've stayed in Bangkok. First of all, I would like to thank the owner of the hostel, Kanin, and his colleagues who made my time here enjoyable. I stayed here one and a half month and the cleanliness of the hostel was the most satisfying part for me. The location of the hostel is great. Restaurants and 711 are within walking distance, and if you want to use the MRT, you can also reach it by walking for only 10 minutes. I will never forget the night we had a Thai style barbecue and had chat on Christmas Eve. Thank you for everything! Highly recommended!!! I do not like to do reviews, but that's amazing accommodation ever.
When I booked this place, I wondered why they have a good review.
The owner is kind and nice, has good locations, and has a clean bed and kitchen.
I'll be back if I travel to Bangkok again 

        My favorite hostel in bkk!

So much street food nearby, close to Lumphini park and such a nice vibe within the hostel to chill out and get some work done

We had two double rooms with private bathroom. Yaks supplied a pair of ear plugs traffic gets noisy if you sleep late into the morning! Breakfast was included, with a choice of 4 set breakfasts. Kids opted for banana, pancakes and scrambled egg every day  It's about 30mins to walk to the nearest train station, taxis are a cost effective way for getting into the city of you're travelling as a group or family. I stayed for two nights. Very good for solo travellers. The staff are friendly. Bunk beds might make u feel a little claustrophobic. Rooms are more specious. Clean washrooms. Very well maintained common hangout areas. Loved the books i could read there. Free n yummy breakfast at the cafe downstairs. I would love to stay w them again if I visit later. I stayed here for 2 days. The hosts are very helpful, polite and friendly. The rooms are very clean. Any problems with the rooms, the staffs respond immediately and take proper action. Even the bathrooms are very clean. They also provide free breakfast which was very good. My stay at Yaks house hostel was nice. I would suggest this to all backpack travellers especially females. its a nice cozy place to relax  the staff is very nice ! the food was excellent  they also guide and help me to the place that i want to visit. ill be back and book here next year for sure!

The rooms are small but clean. The bathroom is unisex  shared by the entire floor. My biggest problem is that there is no sound proofing. You hear every time someone opens  and closes the door, all night long. You have to be a very sound sleeper or very tired to get any rest. For a small fee, the staff will take you to the nearest Station or to the airport. My friend and I stayed here at a 4 people room. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooom was clean, bathroom was public but very clean and tidy. We took a cab back to the airport for 150 BAHT. A very nice choice for short stay. Highly recommend. It was a very location. We got a Grab from the airport and paid 150 BHT to get to this hostel. They offered a taxitransfer to the airport as well starting from 120 for 2 people.
Room and shower were cleaned. It's a cheap choice if you're staying overnight or just for a night or two. It can be noisy if you're not used to living in noisy places.
There's a 711 next door. People are nice and friendly at front desk. They adjusted our book very quickly from 1 person to 2 people I made a mistake when booking. Internet was good. One night stay for morning bus to pataya, it's so fit for us four people to stay. The AC are a little bit louder but is good for me. The toilet, shared bathrooms are so clean with good smells and towels, shampoo, shower cream are alway available. Last, the hostel 's transportation for pick up and drop off to BKK are really cheaper than booking on grab. Only 150 bath for 3 4 people.
Staffs are so gentle, friendly and supportive. No issues with this place, does the job for one night before flying. You wouldnt want to stay here for any longer because not very comfortable.

Not hotels fault but there are no food options other than a 711 near by. Eat at the airport if flying in and staying here.","Monday: Open 24 hours

I must say that if you are on a budget, yet you want a decent place to stay, I recommend this hostel. It is walking distance 56 mins to the train station, there are places to eat, and the amenities common bathroom, eating area, living room are fair. The location of the hostel may not be the best, but it is near a food street market 10mins walk nor touristic at all and very cheap. The staff is very friendly and efficient, and even though is a hostel it is very clean and tidy. Rooms are small, but beds are very comfortable and the AC always works. We would repeat for sure. The staff were nice  not very good with English though even when we tried to check in . We understand its a hostel but they did not provide towels. The showers were so dirty when we arrived however they seemed to have been cleaned every day when we were there. The location is not the best but it was still an enjoyable stay. Excellent location close to the MRT blue line surrounded by everything you could want also an excellent base for exploring the rest of the city. The staff are simply the best . They said they didnt have our booking from agoda because we used discounts. Made us book with their price which is 10 dollars more. Room smaller than a prison cell. No windows. Smelly. Bad service. Stupid key cards didnt work twice. Location inaccessible because there are two flights of stairs and no elevators. Only one socket in a twin room. Only come here if youre desperate for a quick nap.

 The receptionist is really nice and accommodating. Always talks with a smile and very sweet.
 There is a fridge, tv and tub in the room. Altough the room is small and the tub doesn't look well maintained.
 Lift is available and wifi is okay.

What can be improved  The bed was too soft, can be hard to sleep.
 Aircon said cannot go down a certain temperature or else it would switch off. This is very hard on a hot day. Nice place, located behind TOFU
But, there are no Receiptionist stand by, door is unlocked all the time while guest's luggage are at the receptionist.

No lights at all from entrance to room when come back at night. have to walk stairs to 5th floor. Lift is broken since 6 months ago If you are solo travelling and didn't know where to stay, this is a great place to stay for days in Thailand. The place is located exactly behind the famous Tofu Skincare. Sevel is just meters away. Food stalls are everywhere from morning to midnight, say no worries to your bellies. Even the seller are nice too! Walk a little and you have arrived to Pratunam night market, also consider it is located near the street, so you can grab taxi or public bus easily! I like the receptionist very much, he is so nice and full of smile. Anyway, service is the main point of the whole holiday. Please greet him with a friendly smile  .

I reccomend you to book the private room. Decent location for some of the malls. Rooms are big size and air con. There is a big open space on top floor. we had a pleasant experience when staying here. They have a strategic location because it's really close to the bus stop, BTS, mall, Pratunam market and even this hotel is in the same building with Tofu Skincare. we got the price at 250k per night, its really worth it with a clean hotel room, bathtub, water heater unfortunately the one in our room was broken, amities, and others. The elevator also works well. The receptionist is not always there, but shehe is a friendly person. You can do early check in here.","Monday: Open 24 hours

The staff are extremely nice and we enjoyed our short stay! Just needed to crash here for a few hours to beat the heat and refresh. Nice marketplace down the road with cheap fresh food. Charming, accommodating and a great value. 1010 Picked because it was next to the airport, 15 minutes to terminal 1,2, cheap. Great rooms very clean. Also a very nice restaurant nearby called sano kitchen, great for veggie and home cooked meals all of which is grown on the site. This place isnt close to any of the main streets that tourists go to great stay will come back if need be. Thanks Booked through booking which says reception is 247, we had night flight and wanted to have some sleep, we came to the hotel and no stuff, nobody, only phone number on the door that checkin is from 14000000 and two numbers. Both didnt respond. Luckily someone went out and we had a chance to stay in the lobby till morning. We had no local sim card and one of the visitors helped us to call them but they still didnt respond. CHANGE YOUR BOOKING DESCRIPTION. We have visa appointment in the afternoon and feel like trash now after sleepless night. Absolutely irresponsible thing. If you dont have staff in the hotel at night at least be in touch, leave not only number but also WhatsApp. Check your booking requests because I mentioned that were coming after midnight and chose your place because it said 247 RECEPTION",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

It was rather interesting and they had great decorations. There was a fair bit of people in the cafe. I didn't stay in the hostel so not sure how it was.

Generally, I felt that it was nice and pleasant. Might come back here again. Loved this hostel. Rented a 4bed room for myself, my husband, and our 5yearold son for a few nights. We all loved the room, clean and comfortable with a nice artistic vibe. The location was amazing, small neighborhood feel, lots of street art around, not so many tourists. I would definitely stay again.

Enjoyed nice coffees from the cafe. Photocafe and Hostel is a vibrant hub where much more happens than just sipping coffee. It's a place where locals and foreigners alike connect, converse, laugh, and inspire each other. Here, deals are closed, and a shared appreciation for Thailand's cultural heritage and Chinatown thrives. Outstanding place with the kindest of staff. Kars was mega helpful. The only reason it doesn't get vip 5 stars. Lack of breakfast, though this is ample made up by the wide range of teas in the rooms, which are clean and well proportioned.

Because locals are outside on the block we felt comfortable as two young women walking home at night Pros amazing location  3 min walk to a local market across from a hotel called something poshtel, 7eleven, and close to tourist attractions and Khao San road. off the Main Street so very quiet. Alleyways were safe for us to walk through, even late at night. Room had amazing aircon, and linens were very clean. Staff were very friendly and the breakfast was top notch.

Cons cats room freely through the house, and one of them pooped and peed on the walkway in front of the bathrooms sometime in the evening. Tiptoed around it until it was found in the morning by staff as there didnt seem to be a protocol to reach them. Beds are very firm, and rooms dont have good insulation so we got woken up pretty early every morning because of the breakfast prep. This could probably be avoided if you ask for a room on the second floor.

Overall decent stay, really good value for the money! Loved our stay at Baan Kachitpan  location is close to the action but down a quiet side street that makes it very peaceful. The breakfast was top notch, AC was strong and hosts were lovely. Beds a little on the firm side but had great sleeps, thank you BK team","Monday: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Until 

the driver that who drove us to pick up points was just absolutely rude and no manner the way he is handling luggage and the way he speaks he needs some etiquette Tbh the showers and toilets are plenty and work very well.
The dorms were actually very nice.
Lots of stairs and a nice chill area with toast and tea and coffee free in the morning.
Also has laundry service which you can do yourself Clean rooms. Shared bath. A basic hostel with free breakfast. About 10mins walk to Khao San road. The cube hostel Khoasan it is perfect if you are going to stay just a few days to
visit the temples since they are 20m walk from here. Also the beds are comfortable and the service it is so nice. Jay helped me a lot with my trip.
Definetely coming back. Nice and clean place, bedsheets are clean and all in white, toilets and bathroom are clean, good location which it connects to the canal and not far from Kaosan. You can just walk like 700 m, self service for coffee and tea all day. Lovely staff",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
Bed to Bangkok,"1064 67-69 Soi Choei Phuang, Khwaeng Chom Phon, Khet Chatuchak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10900, Thailand",4.5,13.8065206,100.5575524,"The location is fantastic, near the TTB Bank headquarters, so there are plenty of grocery stores, food options, and lively morning and night markets nearby. Theres also a 711 and TOPS supermarket close by, which was super convenient.

 You can enjoy higher quality foods at SOASIS tower most of Korean and Japanese cuisines  recommend iced Thai tea named KARAN at there.

The only downside is that theres currently construction near the main entrance, so cars cant access it directly. the location its easy to walk to the skywalk, which takes you straight to both MRT Mo Chit and BTS stations.

The bathrooms are very clean and stocked with essentials like soap and towels, which I appreciated. Theres also free instant noodles, snacks, and coffee available in the common areasuch a nice touch!

And to top it all off, the prices are super affordable. I highly recommend this place! Great hostel, clean and has good facilities. Good location, 20 minutes walk to Chatuchak market. The room is clean, the shared bathrooms are clean too, as well as the aisle, stairs, and common areas. Instant noodles, bread  jam, and water are provided in the dining area. Wifi signal, although very weak inside the room but still stable and fast.

A major thing to consider 
In front of the hostel there was a huge construction going on. The road was closed for vehicles, and pedestrians were to use a temporary walkway that was very dirty with sand, cement, and water puddles. Before booking, I suggest asking the hostel whether the construction is finished. construction nearby a lit bit noise, but better than hostel i've go to in Bkk. Comfy, spacious, clean. the most important thing, i got room with window so you can get the sun We were so stoked on this place!!

Our first night in Bangkok we stayed in a tiny, dirty, noisy room in the Khoa San area. We were so happy to be somewhere quieter and clean! The rooms and shared bathrooms are very nice and everything is clean. There is complimentary cookies and crackers. The mall and park are nearby. Id absolutely recommend this place for someone looking for a cheap but good accommodation in a quieter part of the city. Also super easy to get to and from the airport on public transit or by car from here. This is probably one of the easier hostels I stayed in. The capsule beds were surprisingly very comfortable. The room was pitch black and no one seemed to want to turn on the lights so it was hard to move around but you get the hang of it!

Showers are nice and hot with above flow showerhead or switch it to the hose head. Bathrooms are clean and well maintained.

There is coffee packets, tea, little snacks, breadtoaster, with 4 kinds of ramens to choose from with platesbowls and utensil needed for everything.

The area is right next to a local popular outdoorindoor shopping stalls where you can find anything from a pen to your next outfit.","Monday: Open 24 hours

It is not fair.
We used this slipper for walking outside and broken off so not take back to the room.
Staff didn't understand our explanation.. couldn't take English.
This is unsatisfy. Good value for money. You will need a cash security deposit.  Local steakhouse across the street with delicious multicultural foods.
Bed had firm mattress, supportive pillows, tea kettle, mini fridge.
Staff speak broken English. Luckily our local friend translated for us.
Old building. Adequately maintained. One of the lower tiered and rural accommodation. Need to be mindful to get back your passport as staff may forgot to return after made copies.

During their wifi exchanges,
Network was disrupted prior any notice given.

Note no small change available in reception as well. Valuable stay with a large room compared to the prices. Less restaurants surrounded and limited car parking when crowded.

The staff was very accommodating and kind. I had to change my dates at the last minute, and they were still able to accommodate me, even though I was in Pattaya yesterday. The staff was very nice and hospitable. I highly recommend this hostel, especially for those on a budget and solo travelers like myself.  I checked in 11pm and I need to check out at 5am. I came straight from Suvarnabhumi airport, 30 mins by taxi meters around 350 baht.
The best location, safe and convenient, street food and 711 is just around the area, near Sky train station within 10 mins walk.
The bed quality is not so good, the female room has a Thai lady talking loudly at 4am not  nice at all.
The toilet rooms and shower rooms are on different floors, clean but provide your own toiletry, they have a hairdryer for you in the shower area.  The man at reception was nice. Over all areas are clean and worth 268 baht lower bed for quick  sleep. The rooms are ehhh, okay at best. I'm someone who was staying here for a week. The woman at the front desk was lacking, but the man at the front desk was on the ball. He did everything right, but the woman is unorganized and unfriendly. I booked a room, and they told me they were overbooked, but I was sitting down stairs waiting to check out for 30 mins. Mind you, it's Saturday, and it's not easy to find accommodations on Saturday, so 30 minutes was wasted because there weren't any staff downstairs. I never saw the man who works on the weekdays do that. Then she tells me I need to cancel or I'll be charged. It sounds like she should be the one figuring that out, not the client who got screwed over. I was reluctant of this place as first, because the norms says ""you get what you paid for"", but this place was surprisingly amazing. The room was very small, but it served it's function Sleep. Once inside, it is very quiet, the aircorn unit is clean, bedding is clean, everything is sparkling clean, but most importantly, you can sleep like boss, so, so quiet, no bugs, no bad smell, just as you would like it to be. Cheap food is plenty available outside, plus near access to 711 and Tops. Price is great for the location. An overnight stay here is a great place for backpackers, solo travelers, or groups of friends and family who love backpacking, and they also have private rooms upstairs but no elevator. Nice view from the rooftop with laundry place. The room is good, clean, and has comfy beds with some space for bags in a safe box. Toilets are excellently clean. They have a shared kitchen with utensils to use, a shared fridge, a shared microwave, and, of course, free drinking water. It's a great location for street food it's very close to the 711 store, walkable to BTS Phrakhanong station, and just nearby to Eastern Bus Station. The staff is good and helpful. Surely, I will stay here again soon.","Monday: 7:30 AM – 10:00 PM

Some people complained that it does not really feel like hostel, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Interior design of the public areas is amazing. A lot of locals hang out there at daytime to take photos, hang out with friends and work. Room was great, although I would have preferred a window that you can open. Dont want to know the C02 meter readings inside the room. Walls are also very thin, we heard other guests, cleaning sounds and various noises very loudly. Bring earplugs. Water pressure could be better. Also there were a bit too many rules like no alcohol and food in the room and others. Staff is super, super friendly. Very close to the Giant Swing. You can visit many monuments and temples which are around the hostel.Lots of food options in the area. It is impeccably clean. They have rooms as well as dorm beds. You can also get your laundry done within the building. The architect did a fantastic job and the interior is beautiful. It is quiet and rooms are sound proof. Beds are comfy. Staff is super friendly and helpful.
The only downside to the private room is that theres no fridge. Absolutely lovely stay here. The hostel looks tiny from outside, but once you get in, you are greeted with a wide, spacious cafe with tasteful decor. Got a private room and it was really clean and new. Highly recommended stay in Khaosan area. The staff is very friendly, helpful and professional. They are giving you a sincere warm welcome already from the beginning.

The lobby is looking really great. Great design which is photoworthy.

The dormroom 8 persons, I think I had got everything you need electric, balcony, toilets showers and washingtabel nearby. Also the lockers that you will get are great and can fit even a big travelbackback.

I'm thankfull for the experience I got. Very lovely and stylish modern hotel in the historic area of Bangkok, with many historic sights and plenty of amazing restaurants in close proximity. Rooms are very clean and modern. Incredible, attentive and helpful staff. Delicious coffee in the lobby. Will be back.",no operation time,"cafe, lodging, food, point_of_interest, establishment"
COZ Ratchathewi Hostel,"141/4, 147 Phetchaburi Rd, Khwaeng Thung Phaya Thai, Khet Ratchathewi, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10400, Thailand",4.4,13.7548365,100.5277494,"The location was great for me. We went to many shopping malls by walking. The general areas of the facility were always clean. But the room was very humid. We spent a long time outside because we had really hard time breathing. Firstly, I chose this place due to the photo showing 711 nearby and easy access to public transportation. But in fact, when I reached the place, there was no 711, as shown in the photo. And since it is located in a crowded area, traffic jams mostly occur, which makes the bus delayed. But you can still go to the train station, which takes about 10 minutes by foot.
Secondly, about the hostel, it does look older than I expected but is kind of acceptable, but I was expecting more about the facilities, such as the provision of toothpaste or combs. But they didn't.
And lastly, the reason that made me decide not to stay here again next time is that the dormitory bed does not stick to the wall. Can you imagine how uncomfortable it was to lie in bed, worrying that the person above me will see me sleeping or can reach me when I am sleeping or not? Rooms are nice and spacious. Toilets are goodish though neither girls bathrooms hairdryers work. Youve got a bus stop right in front of hostel, very convenient.

SO hot if youre not inside the room. You cant cook but theres a kitchen. Breakfast is really little, definitely not enough for everyone. Needed a one night stay in Bangkok before leaving Thailand, this was just the perfect place! 247 there is someone to greet you, and even before checking and after checkout they are happy to offer luggage storage, our suitcases were safe, stuff is above average nice, everyone speaks English. Train to airport is 10 minutes walk, so location for us was perfect. We rented a private room, with bathroom, everything was spotless, very good bed, very nice linens. The common areas are also very clean and tidy, there is a nice lounge to hang out and an outside area to dry clothes and a corner for the smokers. If I could give 6 stars, this place would get it. Thank you! Close to the Ratchathewi station like 10 mins walk! Next to the bus stop!
And cross the road have a local night market or food market street as well !

They don't have lift so for the suitcase is not too friendly !
The bed was comfy and the ac in the room was good

But they have a big spare between the wall and the bed so if someone turn on the light at night could wake you up..

They also provide water refills,!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

The stairs to get up to my top bunk are cramped and a challenge to navigate unless you are tall  narrow.

Also, airflow at top bunk is not good with curtains closed even with AC on which definitely let you smell the damp rankness of the room which overall puts my rating at 2.8. The areas which you would think would smell the bathrooms did not.

However, the instant hot water heater was difficult to adjust the temperatureit went from hot to cold in the shower I used, with no middle ground. Plenty of toilets and showers for many people to be using the washrooms simultaneously.

Regarding the area, it can be difficult to get in and out of Chinatown because of one way and narrow streets made impassable in cars due to street vendors and heavy crowds. It is a walkable area and a good location if you intend on spending most of your time in Chinatown. I suggest a visit to nearby upstairs Opium bar if you like to try various and different sorts of even savory cocktails. However, I do not recommend the duck skewers too chewy. MOST IMPORTANT  rooftop bar not working! u can bring beers from outside but the roof smells bad and looks broken. this roof was the main reason i booked this hostel to get some quiet in Bangkok so u should know itws not working. DORM ROOM  for 4  no window and so stuffing. LOCATION  in the middle of cina town market. STAFF  were lovely, gave me my money back. Great hostel in the heart of China town. Still manges to be pretty quiet! Perfect for Nomads but if you are look for a party hostel, this is not it. I personally loved it for that exact reason.
Nice rooftop where you can do some yoga as well. Staff are lovely. The Luk Hostel was a perfect accomodation in the midst of Chinatown, it offered cafe and breakfast in the ground floor and they had an elevator going up until the 5th floor, not including the 6th floor with a common area. The rooms where a bit small, and the beds a bit hard, plastic consistency, but in general I slept very good. The beds were build high, so even the lower bunkbed was elevated slightly, which was kind of nice. I really liked the staff, very relaxed and efficient. They helped me get my lower bukbed super easy and fast per telefon, and when I wanted to extend they where really flexible about it. It's a quite clean, good location. Very helpful staff. But the dorm rooms are too tiny, and unequal distribution of space. No space to open bags","Monday: Open 24 hours

Clean. Close to BTS. Great stay, having stayed at this hostel on 2 other occasions, i know what i am getting. Rooms are very spacious, and bathrooms are very clean.

The staff is very good and easy to communicate, he also assists us.

The bed is comfortable, the family room is spacious with a sink, private toilet and bath, and free shampoo and soap.

Aircon is working and cold.

The room comes with a mini table and chairs, a locker, and two big windows for sunlight.

Near shopping malls and BTS Victory Monument Station. Overall great stay. This hostel is a great way to start your Thailand adventure. The service, location, rooms and atmosphere is fantastic. The host is really helpful. On top of that, the location is really great which is about 15 minutes walk to BTS VICTORY MONUMENT STATION. There are many shops, malls, good cafes, restaurants, street food stalls and 7 eleven shops around that area. Furthermore, this is like the central of everything, buses are available and easily accessible. Airport bus to this area is approximately 40 minutes and cost only 30 Thai bath. Overall, this hostel is amazing! We stayed there for 1 night. The host was really kind, nice spot, the room was big and the bathroom was really nice. I would recommend it 100. Nice big room in the ""run down aesthetic"", it was very clean but most importantly the Service was incredible! Only 15 minutes to the BTS and 3 stations to the center Siam with Convenience stores and shops just around the corner! We would definitely come back again the next time we're in Bangkok!

Very social and so easy to meet fellow travelers. Best Backpackers hostel with fun and exciting events every night. The reception area are  all lovely and very informative. The Reps are all lively and make sure everyone is included and having fun. If you are not having fun here something wrong with you.
You can also just chill and watch the events and thats totally fine with them.

They have free dinner every night and happy hour extended!!! Best hostel in the town. Staff were amazing. They have fun activities every night. PLUS THE FREE DINNER is a bonus 
Jen made my stay so comfortable. And also Lino is one of the reps whose hosting the event is so good. Will be back soon.  goodjob Excellent hostel just off the beaten path in KhaoSan. Very social, great activities and the staff are incredible. Meow, Kate and Liz are stellar volunteers and brought the best vibes.

You have a kitchen that you can use. No water, you gotta buy yourself. Beds have personal fans. No curtains. 4 bathrooms for 20 beds. Some fans in fan rooms dont works properly. Its okay for a couple of days. Cheap, great vibes.
You get what you pay for but still on the nicer end for a super super cheap hostel.
Cleaners were very friendly and hard working, reception staff were both short but not rude.

Close to all the Bangkok backpacker action but far enough away that you can sleep earlier if you like away from all the noise.

Walking distance of everything you need to have a great time, lots of options for tourism packages too, ask staff about this. Excellent hostel. Staff are amazing especially June and Thong. Great location.

One suggestion would be a little click magnetic light for beds in fan room for the night. Born Free Hostel is a haven nestled in the heart of Bangkok!

From the vibrant atmosphere to the warm and welcoming staff, this place feels like a home away from home.

The cozy ambiance, coupled with the comfy beds and well equiped kitchen, made my stay an absolute delight.

The communal spaces are perfect for meeting fellow travelers and sharing stories, fostering an incredible sense of community. Kudos to the fantastic owner for their exceptional hospitality and creating an unforgettable experience.

I'll definitely be back to soak up more of the Born Free magic! Lovely helpful staff, great place and affordability for young travellers.

There's was 6 of us in the 6 bed dorm at the top and we had our own garden chill area too.

Cute cats live at the property.

We came back to hang out for the day one time because we enjoyed the vibe there.

PROS
 Affordable single private rooms with plenty of hangers and electric plugs.
 One bathroom each for women and men so never really any wait to use restrooms or showers
 Right next to a park with running track, outdoor gym, bars and equipment for calisthenics
 Location right next to Blue Line MRT, not too far from Grand Palace, Chinatown, Khao San
 Great place for working and studying. Downstairs caf has affordable drinks  food, good coffee in an aircon environment, not too loud music, free filtered water. Common area is a bit hot but can turn on fans and was cooler at night.
 Nearby places to eat. Towards the park a minute walk away are food stalls. In the evening across from the park are evening food stalls including coconut ice cream uncle! 20 THB for homemade coconut ice cream. Not far at Old Siam Plaza is a food court with almoststreet prices in an aircon environment.
 Many free amenities like filtered water, coffee, tea, biscuits, toothbrush kit, QTips, sanitary pads, slippers. Hair dryer for use at every floor.
 Overall quiet area with a lot of gun shops. But I usually saw police, security, army folks around so felt safe.
 Overall clean hostel, felt new.

CONS
 Use of disposable cups in caf and common room. Even the cappuccino in caf was served in a paper cup. You can ask for it in a regular cup though, along with a regular glass to fill with water. In common area, would prefer reusable mugs and cups instead of paper cups.
 Need to carry card key with you all the time including in bathroom. But I understand the reasoning prevents overuse of electricity. This is more like a luxury hostel. Really enjoyed my 2 nights here, stayed in the single private room it was clean. The shared bathroom was always kept clean. The common area has free snacks and drinks coffee, tea  water. The cafe on the ground floor has delicious food and great coffee at a good price. And not to mention the MRT station is not even 100m away, very convenient. This was a good place to stay and was definitely luxurious for a hostel! I loved my room. Accessible to the MRT and a bit hidden which is good if you want some quiet. A little HostelCafe just behind the MRT Samyot. I visited the Cafe while waiting for a friend to arrive. The Cafe is very clean and has a cozy chill vibe to it. The drinks at the Cafe are very reasonable price. I ordered the honey soda and it's just cost me 65thb. The staff here is very lovely and speak English well which is always a plus  I think its a new hostel, overall i had a good experience staying for 2 nights here. The room and bathroom are clean. the common area is at 5th floor without lift so be aware, its also hot most of the time no ac, but there are ceiling fan provided with coffeetea and drinking water  refrigerator.

we're provided with a card access for the room, kind of unconvenient bcs u have to unplug the card whenever u take a bath but its okay. its like 10meters from Exit 3 MRT Sam Yot but after sundown its so quiet, even the closest 7eleven is still far for me. Its good if you look for a quiet area.",no operation time,"cafe, lodging, store, food, point_of_interest, establishment"

Only issue is location, not very close to very many things, apart from strip clubs if thats what your interested in, for us however we had to travel over an hour to get to the city central which is slightly annoying.

Great people though and very affordable stay. Great option to spend a few nights in Bangkok. Comfortable and clean!

 Rooms super spacious, the ac works great, the private room has its own small balcony with chairs and a place for you to hang your clothes to dry. You have a desk to work or do whatever you want. Points of improvement somehow there were a lot of ants in the desk, but there wasnt a big deal. Power outlets and a small furniture beside the bed would be very helpful.
 Internet worked very well inside the room, so it was great.
 Bathroom I believe there are enough toilets and showers for everyone so it does never get crowded. Shower is good and toilet was clean most of the times just a matter of other guests respecting the place. The toilet cabins could be a little bigger, but it is not a big deal. A small soap is provided when you arrive but there is no shampoo.
 Big plus They provide bread and jam from 6 to 10 every morning, coffee and hot water all day long and you can use the laundry machine for free as well.
 Amenities the common area is small but great. They also have a room for people to work with ac, so if you need to work, thats your place.
 Staff staff is super nice, very helpful and smiley. They all spoke a very good english.
 Location very good in our point of view. It is in a quiet area, but fairly close to buses and BTS station 15min walking.
Summing up, we would definitely stay here again and we believe it is one of the best choices in Bangkok price vs quality. Love it  this is a good place to stay for a couple of days in Bangkok. Stayed several times, friendly staff and jam in the morning 
Good location, on the street you will find mototaxi drivers on the corner who will take you to the BTS for 30 baht, a taxi to the DMK airport 300 baht. We stayed here for 7nights and we only paid 5880B for 2 rooms! Very affordable and comes with breakfast bread with 2 choices of spread and coffee.  The staff are nice. The only struggle we faced during our stay here was we had to walk through 4th floor to get to our rooms!  we are not used to walking so it was hard for us. No elevator but for me, it was a good exercise.  Exceptional Experience. This our first stay at a Hostel. While traveling we would typically stay at a Hotel or AirBnB. Because of its location and the amount of time we would be staying we figured wed give it a shot.

1 The staff was simply Amazing and help to provide a friendly and familiar atmosphere.

2 The room was clean and well maintained. We got a private room with a queen size bed for 12 for the night.

3 The hostel provided a washing machines for your convenience.

4 Free Breakfast  Bread and Jam. What do  you expect for 12 bucks.

The experience was so good that we decided to stay at other hostels during our remaining6 weeks of vacation.

Very easy to get here from the airport using metro. About 60 baht from suvanabummi and then a short 5 minute walk. Very friendly and helpful receptionist who speak English!!! Comfy private room helped me get over jet lag. Also had free BBQ chicken on Saturday, if you buy a drink. Great vibes at this hostel. Much nicer than the other hostels I stayed at during my Bangkok trip. Comfy rooms and very nice staff. Bathrooms were nice and clean too and they don't rip you off on towels too bad. Just a deposit if I remember correctly.  Washing machine and dryer aren't great but it's better than nothing. Anyone that has anything bad to say about Siamaze ought to be shot, and shot and reshot just to be sure you are dead and cant do further harm to the society . This place is just like it sounds... amazing. Staffs were friendly and helpful. Selfservice breakfast is simple and nice. Rooms were comfy, quiet and the blackout curtain  cold aircon is the recipe for oversleeping . Stayed in 4 bed dorm for 3 nights. Toiletsbath is great and cleanclinical. Hotshower working perfectly. And the bidet is 5star hotel grade . Also it's on a quiet and peaceful street compare to the rest of Ratchada area. I traveled alone to Bangkok and stayed alone. So when I was trying to book a hostel this was the first one listed and I read the reviews and it was positive and I booked the hostel.  I really really loved this hostel and this was first time I stayed in a hostel. It was very clean and the fest desk was very helpful. I took a 8sharing Dom and sheets were clean and the lockers were very big to fit in 2 big suitcase. BREAKFAST  I really like that why they though through this idea you make your own egg you technically you make you own breakfast which is a fantastic idea. Loved the breakfast as well. I made couple friends in the common area and I stayed there for 3 days and I totally loved it. If you are reading this please dont have second thoughts of booking this place. I would definitely visit this hostel again. What a great place.
The staff is very friendly and competent.
The rooms and sheets were clean, the washrooms tidy,

Upkeep is very nice.

Location is not its USP  but I didn't mind renting a taxi once or twice a day if that meant I lived away from the hustle bustle of BKK.
Loved it and recommend to others.

Breakfast  was included but they're pretty disciplined about the timing till 10 AM so will recommend you be no later than 945.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Music downstairs is a bit loud but the staff enforce an 11pm curfew so after that point it's fine to sleep. Rooms were good with large locker and lockable compartment in each bed with privacy curtains, power sockets and light for each bed. Great staff. Rooms have great AC, and you cant hear the busy roads outside at night. Bar downstairs is always busy, and the staff host various activities across the day. Will be coming back x Cool building, lovely staff, great beds with curtains and a trunk and a locker per person  arguably one of the best hostels Ive stayed in with megadorms. If youre looking to sleep before midnight, however, this isnt it. People will be in and out leaving the door open so the hot air and noise of Khao San wont let you be before 02.00so I guess you just gotta join them  I think this hostel is very good if you are coming for social activities and to stay in a dorm room, the staff is super friendly and helpful and the pool and generally the outside area is pretty good also the shared bathroom is great.

But we stayed in a private room and it wasnt the best, the whole room is just a bed with barely space, and we had a lottt of noise up until the late hours of the night like 2 AM.
Not to mention there is a party going on until 11pm at the hostel and you cant sleep before that.

So i think you should just know those things before booking because it can be the best hostel for some people and for others mot the best option. What an amazing hostel! The staff are great, especially Kanokwan, Will and Adam! They made our stay extra special!

The staff came out with us and partied and did a super job of keeping everyone hyped up and partying!

It is a party hostel, so be ready for lots of noise and debauchery and shower after you get out of the pool lol!

Super close to Khao San rd, so if thats the vibe youre looking for, you wont be disappointed!

Id give them 6 stars if I could, and I hope to visit again very soon!","Monday: Open 24 hours

The pro here is that it's very close to Hwai Kwang MRT.

The cons here are that the room is not fully polished and the things they provided are of very cheap quality. The interior lights are very bad.

You get what you pay is what I can say. And I regret it. The building is modern and nice however to get there from the Main Street is a bit far and you have to take turns left and right repetitively. You can book a taxi but unlikely to just grab the one on the way. The surrounding there is quiet as it is innermost of the sub streets and you will have to see the local homes around there, so thats a plus point of location if you want to explore local lifestyle. Other than, if you want to tour around the city for sightseeing and food hunting, I recommend staying near bts or mrt or near around that neighborhood would be great for you. the front desk was easy to reach by calling even at 6am.
the rooms are confortable and spacious but there is only stairs the reach the 4th floor.
the location is a little inconvenient since there is only one way out of the area to reach the main street. Location OK
Big problem is, cleaner using my toothbrush to clean up the sink , really ?! 
My room got cockroach The room itself is big, and we got a balcony we can access. There is no elevator so you would have to carry the luggages. Near MRT exit 2, there is a shortcut.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Perfect location for all the public transport links and near some great shops and dining options.

The room was simple but perfectly comfortable, but the team made it the perfect choice for me.  Zee, Jib, Grace and the rest of the team made me feel so welcome.

Special thank you to Zee who is just an amazing bundle of energy and positivity and had time to share what I should do and how, thank you Zee.  Youre a great ambassador for the Lub D brand and I wish you every success in your career.

See you next time Im in amazing Bangkok!!  Affordable with fairly central location. Good for solo backpackers. Really love the interaction with the receptionists. Able to speak English well.

Saw cockroaches almost everyday in the room. Common shared toilet at every floor.

Provides luggage storage. Beware theres no lift in the building. Not ideal for shoppers. This hostel is very comfortable to sleep in, no noise at all, and it is also close to the BTS, near the food area at night, near the famous shopping mall MBK. The room we stayed in was room number 202. We stayed with my girlfriend for three days, from August 10 to 12, 2024. This place is great if anyone comes to stay here. The receptionist will let you spin the wheel to win prizes from the accommodation. I recommend everyone to try to stay here. I did not like this place at all, the truth on arrival the staff was friendly but they did not help me at all with the suitcases. Taking into account that I travel with 3 suitcases and there is no elevator.
On the other hand, for people traveling alone is not the most suitable place, there are no activities to meet people, there is no restaurant and  or cafeteria.
The toilets were dirty with papers on the floor and not to mention the noise you hear from the street, it is a main road and you can actually hear quite a lot in the room. Superb hostel. The staff have been so accommodating and have welcomed me with open arms. I planned to hop between hostels, but I chose to stay here the whole time.

Be sure to ask the staff questions  they have a lot to offer!

It is in the center but you can catch good green wiev from windows. The street is amazing. Not noisy but stylish street. We initially had a slight problem with our booking, but the lady working at reception was so lovely to give us an upgrade to the best room, the room was big, modern, clean and had a great view of Bangkok. The location was also perfectly situated next to many bars and restaurants. I highly recommend staying at this hotel Unprofessional Staff Ruining an Otherwise Decent Hotel

Ive stayed at Mary P. Hotel in Bangkok five or six times and even recommended it to more than eight of my friends. Unfortunately, despite the decent location and acceptable facilities, the experience has been consistently ruined by the rude and unprofessional behavior of the front desk receptionist. From my first stay, I noticed her attitude, but I let it slide. However, each time I returned, her behavior worsened.

Most recently, during a phone call to make a prereservation, she rudely hung up on me. When I arrived with three friends to check in, her rudeness made us feel completely unwelcome. Her lack of commitment to her job and blatant unprofessionalism forced us to reconsider staying there.

When I asked her to call her boss so we could address the issue, she flatout refused. This isnt the first time Ive seen complaints about her behavior in reviews, and it seems nothing is being done to address it.

Its a shame because the hotel is located in a great area, but this receptionist ruins the entire experience. I hope management takes notice and addresses this serious issue. Stayed for quite a bit of time while in Bangkok, great rooms for a great price, clean, everything you need, staff are amazing, especially Pearva, who went the extra mile for me! All the staff in the restaurant are cool and very helpful too. I recommended this place to friends who are coming to this area all the time. Was able to get a sound sleep every night with the fan on maximum and a rock hard mattress. They provided a refund on my payment when I had to split early. Also the siding that the street is on, provides a non vechilar haven. Still able to stumble back from Khao San road legless.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"

Very clean and great staff. Good ac. Nice lounge area and sitting outside area. Quiet and areas to do work if needed. Free ice cream happy hour! Wifi worked great. Free coffee and use of refrigerator. Free hotcold water. Each dorm bed also has a personal fan along with ac. Good location. Comfortable pillows! Shower pressure was amazing!! I would recommend. Best Hostel I stayed in, in Bangkok.
Very clean beds, showers and toilets. Beautiful common area and a balcony next to the river. The host also was kind and understanding. I arrived from the airport at 3 am and they welcomed me and gave me a room with a discount although I didnt have enough cash so they let me pay the rest in the morning. Highly recommended! Weve been staying only for one night but everything was perfect. We booked the family room on the fifth floor including a big bed, a bunker bed for kids a shower and a toilet. The room was big with a nice view on the canal. Towels and hair dryer available. Staff was very friendly. There is a common room on the first floor including a kitchen, TV and sitting area. Location was absolutely perfect and quiet, near Khao San Road. Love that it was in old town making it easy to walk to good food. Cute rooms, lovely staff highly recommend!

Silom Space Hostel,"8 Si Lom Rd, Khwaeng Suriya Wong, Khet Bang Rak, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10500, Thailand",4.3,13.729172,100.5355152,"Ive stayed at silomspace for 4 nights and it helped me to save money for foods a lot since they have complement noodle got the guests. Thats what I love about, and cleaning staff do their responsibilities well.
Location also good, there are local shops around which are absolutely delicious and some of them are quite famous through Social Media.
Receptions are lazy, not friendly and they dont seem to welcome guests nicely. Most of their guests are male travelersbackpackers. Toilets and shower doesnt have key, its open even there is male shower room just in front.
I recommend this place who doesnt really care about that security things I mentioned. Ill not recommend for solo female traveler who doesnt like noisethere is a night club next door, the environment people always around.
Overall, I could use laundry and enjoyed neighbors, I put 3 stars. I've stayed at Silom Space Hostel in Bangkok twice, and both times it was an excellent experience. The hostel is very clean, wellmaintained, and conveniently located near both a metro and BTS station. One thing to note is that the entrance is through an alley next to a gay club. While this isnt an issue, if you arrive late in the evening, you might see a crowd outside. The security is friendly and will simply wave you through to the side entrance. I'll be here for 6 nights from today, but to be honest, I'm depressed. First of all, the receptionist is too unfriendly. She doesn't even respond. Also, I was delayed on my flight and arrived at the hostel before 10pm tonight. At that time, the woman said, ""You will be sharing a room with men."" Even if I'm told something like that late at night, I can't leave the hostel I'm staying at. I booked this hostel more than 2 weeks ago, so she could have messaged me to let me know that there were no womenonly rooms available, but she didn't. She said, ""We might be able to change to a womenonly room tomorrow,"" but I don't trust her. Overall not a great experience. If you are a light sleeper, do not go there. The ground floor turns into a gay bar that blasts kpop until at least 3 a.m. Matresses are very hard, but overall rooms were clean and the curtain really blocks light. Service was okay, staff were friendly but did not seem to care that much. Despite the common room, not really a hostel where you can socialize and meet people. I wish they put the same amount of effort into making it a nice stay as they did making it LOOK like a nice stay.

Cons
The staff is uncaring and apathetic. Unhelpful. They tried to check us out at 10am when it's clearly stated that checkout is at 11.

The beds are very hard and uncomfortable. They charge you extra if you want an extra pillow.

The hostel is right above a gay night club, so be prepared for loud noise all night long, and for the club's bouncer not letting you into the building thinking you're trying to sneak into the party. If you are a man, you will be bothered by the club goers.

The place smells like mold all the time.

Pros
The showers are great. Strong stream. The provided shampoo is disgusting though, bring your own soap

The bed curtain is nice and isolating

The free water, coffee, and instant ramen is a nice touch.

The washing machine works well and pretty cheap 40baht for washing, 10 baht for soap, and 10 baht for 10 minutes of dryer.

If you contact me at the airport, they will pick you up right away.
It also provides brief information about traveling to Thailand.
If you ask, please provide detailed instructions.

Although there is some lack of traces of careful attention to detail,
It seems like a really nice place to relax for a night.
Another big advantage is that there is a 7Eleven nearby.
If you are looking for a guesthouse with great value for money, I highly recommend Marie Guesthouse The owner is so kind and nice! This was my second visit, and they remembered me haha. The room was cool and clean with air conditioning! The owner was really kind and full of information on where the best places were.

The price is also low and the management is good, it is recommendable guest house. I chose the accommodation because the reviews were good, but I couldn't feel the friendliness at all.. I made a reservation through Agoda, but I felt like they were welcoming an uninvited guest, asking where I made the reservation. I booked for 5 nights because the atmosphere wasn't great and I felt uncomfortable, but I ended up moving after only 2 nights. It's a waste of a 1 rating!

It was run by the owner, her son, and her daughter.
Is that the Korean Geha who put up the Taegeukgi in Soi 10..?

My room was very clean, quiet and comfortable.  As a solo woman traveler, I felt safe and secure.

Nice to stay in a less touristy area near the local markets.  I will be staying again when I return to Bangkok.  Highly recommended! I loved this place. Straight off 16h of travel and no sleep the night before I was ready for a great night sleep and i I got it. Everyone was either really quiet or my loop ear plugs are better that I thought. The bedding was just an under sheet and the top was more like the material of a towel so I asked for a top sheet instead and they kindly gave me one. I was upstairs at the end of the hall so if you have a small bladder that could be an issue as the bathrooms are downstairs. The stairs are really steep which didnt worry me but if you have dodgy joints it would not be great. Air con was great, staff were great. Never had to wait for the loo but I was up at 6am and when I came back from a morning walk and boat ride just after ten it was pretty busy in the cafe area downstairs!
The neighbourhood is great and I would stay again! We had a lovely stay at Tavee. The team is super friendly and welcoming, making our stay so much more enjoyable. Coffee and breakfast is served there as well, which we really enjoyed having in the peaceful little garden area. We'll definitely come back! Thank you  12 years that i visit frequently this guest house. It really became my second home in Bangkok and i cant imagine going somewhere else!
The rooms are clean, confortable and suit to different budgets with private or shared bathroom, with fan or aircon. There is a super atmosphere, the family is professional and very helpful giving infos, organizing your bookings if needed etc. The breakfast is delicious special mention for the  club sandwich  . And the guests are from all nations, all ages so you always can meet interesting people here! Very well located, as its in a very calm district  and at the same time close from everything.
Another super point  there is a storage room for free!
Thank you for everything  it feels good to come back to your place! This guest house is hosted by a nice  professional family. Its atmosphere is a gem. Its location is a beauty in contrast with moderm, industrial Bangkok. We'll be back","Monday: Open 24 hours

Cons The private room was dirty, better not to talk abou smells like sh... Mosquito repellent is mandatory.
Otherwise the host was helpful and  let me check in very late.
Try your luck and maybe we guests make it a real hide gem  The owner was very kind and helpfull, always asking if i was doing okay. Owner is a good hardworking guy, i had a great stay for 2weeks, great river view!,was very clean, hot water, very secure, and felt comfortable in the area. Lots nearby and neighbors are friendly, so atleast say hi to them in their language! Everything you need is a walk away! And great price for rooms! For the amount I paid, can only give 3 out of 10 because the same amount i can get a room with Aircon and bathrooms attached, a TV and fridge but view here is fantastic, over looking Chao Praya river. Lots of mosquitoes, but have mosquitoes net. Location not easy to locate unless very good at Google map and sense of direction. Great river view. From terrace, not from your room. We spent a night in some place without windows. No light and lots of sound through thin walls. Shared bathroom is old and dirty. Only if your budget is extremely tight. This place is just great!

If you are looking for a nice view and good atmosphere this is definitely the place to go, its a hidden gem within a huge city, you have to walk through small roads to get there but when you are there its quiet and great!

The owner Ben is just an amazing human being  he gonna make your day better with his great humour.

The rooms are great, for the price its just what you expect, nothing more or less.

Probably the best place to stay in Bangkok for backpackers there looking for a place to hangout in and go back to after a hectic day in the city 

The location is good, walking distance to the party street and food street, and about 5 min away for the ferry transport, the bus to the airport 901 is 5 min walk away as well.

The place is very well run, and offers laundry service, has a small restaurant downstairs with good food, and they can arrange tours and taxi service to the airport. This is a multistory building, and the stairs are a bit steep, so be careful. It can be difficult to explain to taxis how to get there, but most know the nearby intersection called Si Sao Thewet pronounced ""see sow teywait"". I had a excellent stay here. All basic things were good and the location is perfect. I recommend this place and will return for sure when I'm back in Bangkok. Wow! An unbelievably excellent find! OMG youd be lucky to stay here in an original teakwood guesthouse.. with a super friendly staff, amazingly excellent Thai cuisine.. And so close to a pier where you can catch a water taxi..to go on day trips any place in Bangkok. WOW! again.","Monday: Open 24 hours

Suneta Hostel Khaosan,"209, 211 Thanon Phra Sumen, Talatyod, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand",4.5,13.7606803,100.4990609,"Had a excellent 4 night stay here, the 4bed dorms are terrific and the bigger one looked nice as well. The premises are fairly clean and the hangout area downstairs is nice, equipt with Netflix and other subscriptions. They wash clothes for 70bht per kilo and the location is pretty good in my opinion. Central jet very little noise in the dorms who are cool, dark and quiet.
The staff was amazing to us and the breakfast is alright, note you have to make your own eggs and wash up after.

Only factor pulling our stay down was the advertisement of activies and companies doing elephant riding. Its 2024 and I feel as though you deserve consequences if you still advertise animal abuse. I had an Amazing Experience Very Friendly Staff Lovely breakfast, Room and wash rooms are perfectly clean. Tea,Coffee and cookies  are Free at any time. Very lovely and a homely hostel, host Kat is very warm and welcoming. Free breakfast is really good with lots of options. Very subtle and simple hostel for the peace lovers. Very friendly staff, great location, clean, calm and nice dorms with your own wooden door big dorm. Nice lobby to get to know other travelers!

I had a great stay at the suneta hostel! Jam awesome staff member even gave me some flexibility with the check out that it fitted my travel plans! Much appreciate it! I will come back!  Super cool, friendly and helpful staff!
Very convenient location

As far as food was concerned, it was pretty good! The deokbulgi was great, as was the bulgogi that was tried. Kimchi pajeon was a great standalone by its own. It was seriously too much, but it was managed to be devoured with satisfaction. Not to mention the owner's 2 cute dogs adding to the flavour of the place! Was annoying. Arriving at 6am so tired. It was a old man sitting at reception, since the first moment he was squeezing the situation to give me a bed. After showing me the room and screaming while was people sleeping in, He Told that I should wait until 8am. It were six something. I just leave my backpack there for ten minutes while I found another hostel with available room to check in. I came back and I took my backpack, he became so angry asking for money for saving my backpack for only ten minutes. Even threatening and insulting. Pushing me with a chair to get inside and trying to lock me in!

I'm a peaceful person otherwise I would have a big problem with this guy.
I guess that he is only the night shift person and doesn't even know how to check in someone. But anyway the manager should know about this situation. So annoying to lead with this guy without sleeping after a long long trip to arrive in Bangkok.
Hope that you guys can talk to him and explain how to talk with customers. Enjoyed the papaya smoothie! Thanks to the kind owner. 1st room we stayed in the AC was very noisy, 2nd room we stayed in was by the road so was very loud with the traffic going past all hours. But its close to Khaosan Road and not far from the main places to visit like the Grand Palace etc. Friendly host who gave us some tips and advice. Great hostel, no curtains, great bathroom, good beds. Enjoyed my stay here a lot, 5 mins walk to the Khaosan area.

Staff is very kind and helpful!

The Tangerine Guesthouse,"41/7 ซอย พิชัย 1 Yannawa, Khet Sathon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10120, Thailand",4.1,13.7172479,100.5282284,"Recently stayed at this guesthouse for 6 days and 5 nights, and it was an excellent experience overall. This place is definitely value for money.

The room and toilet were sparkling clean, which made the stay even more comfortable. The small kitchen was wellequipped with all the necessary amenities. The bed was soft and comfy, ensuring a good night's sleep after a day of exploring the city.

The location is also a major plus. Its just a 6minute walk to the BTS train station, making it convenient to get around Bangkok. Additionally, there are several local restaurants nearby, and I found the food to be tasty and delicious. 7Eleven is also within walking distance, which is great for grabbing any essentials and snacks.

Overall, I highly recommend this homestay for anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay in Bangkok.

P.s. special thanks to the guesthouse owner for communicating with us to cater our needs throughout the 6D5N stay. I cannot recommend this place enough!!! This stay was the highlight of our trip to Bangkok. All of my friends loved it so much.
The host let us check in early. The directions to finding the guesthouse were extremely clear tip just search the Tangerine Guesthouse. It is only 78 minutes away by St. Louis BTS station on foot. It is located very close to an international school so the neighborhood felt very local and safe. The check in process was very clear and easy. The room is very clean and has beautiful big windows. There is a washer and a dryer on the 1st floor to use which were extremely helpful.
The street has many hair salons, food carts, cafes  massage parlors. This is a perfect place to be if you like peace and quiet away from the super touristy areas.
The host is extremely professional. When we had an issue with the shower drain the host was quick to respond and sent a cleaner to address the issue ASAP. She is always there to answer your questions. We had an excellent 5 nights stay at this brand new guest house at 15 minutes walking distance from BTS St. Louis.
From exit 2 of BTS, walk down Soi 11 for 12 minutes, then turn on your left at Soi 3 and walk 35 more minutes.
Check in is done via codes, which the owner sent you, to enter at the entrance door.
Our room was large, with a sofa and a desk, with new and silent AC, activated by the room key, with a fully functional kitchen with large fridge, microoven, sink and kettle. Excellent WiFi connectivity and thr most silent aircon I found in Bangkok.
Also the bathroom was new, with excellent hot water and good pressure, nicely decorated  in the tones of green white and black.
Everywhere is spot clean and very very functional and safe. A washing machine is available for the guests on ground floor for 30 Thai bath.
A 711 convenience store is located at the corner of the street, just 5 minutes walking. The area is full of nice breakfast places and restaurants.
We did not meet the owner but she was very responsive via WhatsApp messages and there was a livein cleaning lady, though she spoke only Thai. When we had a small issue clogged shower drain it was resolved immediately with no hassle.
Additional points for the refillable bottles of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, all of great quality. Unfortunately Bangkok has no recycling policy we tried to separate paper from plastic and glass in the dustbin, but  not sure it helped.
Excellent ratio quality  price. Great European lookalike family hotel. Outstanding clean. Modern technique  equipment. Good place to stay if you travel as a family. Its a very safe place stay. Selfcheck in and good for people who enjoy privacy. Room is clean and neat the space is also big. I booked the family suite and my family enjoy staying there.",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
ERAWAN HOUSE,"17/1-2 Chanasongkram Phra-Artid Road, Chanasongkram, Phanakorn, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand",3.9,13.7621852,100.4943501,"A small but cozy and very clean and comfortable guest house. Bed sheets were perfectly clean and smelt fresh, the staff was super friendly and helpful, together with a reasonable price. If youre a backpacker this place is exactly what you want. For this price together with the location and comfort this is a great choice. We stayed there for a short time, and they let us check in a little earlier because we needed it. It is a tiny comfy hotel to stay in. The rooms are a little small, but as we used the room only to sleep and shower, that didnt bother us.

The perfect thing is the reception. The lady and the gentlemen in the reception were very nice and helped us in everything including printing some forms we need with their printer. Their English was EXCELLENT and we had no issues in communication we are very happy for that.

The hotel was in a good location, near the Koh San Road, but in a silent and street. We slept perfectly. The bathroom was very good and clean, there werent even a little stain on anywhere. The hot water was running without any problem. Would certainly recommend there! This room provided us with almost everything we needed in a hotel room. The rooms were clean minus the ceiling cobwebs that only a super tall person would recognize. The shower water pressure was great, although controlling hotcold was hit or miss. The tv turned on every time I turned on the power and I usually ended up watching something, although the reception was very poor and grainy. The beds were comfortable and I got two great nights of sleep. The location of this place was awesome. The vendors in the area were amazing to visit. Simple hotel for short stay on your trip to other areas of Thailand. Many tour agencies for busboat trips to the southern islands and regions. As well daily minibus services to BKK airports. Rooms are basic but completely acceptable for the price charged. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Location is excellent at the quiet end of soi Rambuttri. We liked it though for a second stay a month later on our return to Bangkok..","Monday: Open 24 hours

The room walls and roofing are fully worked with Wood. They provided an extra bed for kids with a nominal payment. We could sleep well. The breakfast was delicious. I will definitely stay here on my next visit. The service is high quality.I highly recommend this property. The staff was super attentive, kind, and accommodating. Whatever we needed they saw to! My wife and I felt well taken care of during our whole stay. When we told them we were leaving early they packed a togo breakfast for us, which was a treat at the airport when we needed it. The room was a little cramped with all the big furniture. However it was queit, clean, and really comfortable which is everything we needed in this area of Bangkok. Would repeat and would recommend. Stayed for a long weekend in December and is the perfect base to explore Bangkok from. Beautiful 3bedroom boutique hotel with excellent, friendly service from the entire team. Probably the best night sleep in a hotel I've ever had  exceptionally comfortable beds and a peaceful area.

Situated in the heart of the old town, with a great atmosphere, with a light festival in the small park opposite when I visited and great local eateries. Very easy to get around  the Grand Palace and Wat Pho are only a short walk away.

Absolutely loved my stay, and will come again next time I'm in Bangkok. Perfect boutique hotel  everything was spot on including the location for exploring Bangkok in a few days. Thank you for having us! Beautiful hotel. Spotlessly clean. Staff were all extremely friendly and lovely to chat to. Breakfast and afternoon tea were exceptional, and they accommodated me very well as a vegetarian. The room downstairs is small but fine for one person and not too much luggage! The bed is very comfortable and shower is amazing! Would absolutely come back here again if I am back in bangkok!",no operation time,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment"
