Enjoyed a delicious dinner at Santa Fe restaurant. Enough space for parking. Got to see some food exhibition from top chef participating in different food competitions in that Titanic hall. I did some shopping and had a good time with my friends. One of the recommendation while you visit in Bangkok.
Central World aspires to be more than just a mall, but a place where everyone comes to enjoy and celebrate life and the lifestyle one seeks through yearround activities and events which aim to excite and inspire. A mustvisit destination for local and foreign shoppers right in the middle of Bangkoks most prestigious address, Central World covers a retail floor area of 830, 000 m at Ratchaprasongintersection.
Everybody knows Central World as it is located right at the heart of Bangkok and Supermarket BigC is just across the street.
The only comment I' d like to add is the mini food court on the 3rd floor, where you can sit down, eat your purchased food and take a good view on the hustle and bustle streets through the windows. The corner has a number of eatery stalls but not all shops were rented out the day we went, so it was kind of quietgood for us tourists who wanted to relax and chilled out after hours of shopping.
Kind of one of the biggest shopping Mall in BKK. All brands are here and also enjoy the foods there as well as have inside and night market infront. ..
I didn' t really spent a lot of time here but I didn' t have any issues in my stay here. It is a big mall but it is easy to navigate because it has a lot of monitorsguidemap inside the mall to help you find what you are looking for. Or you may ask the staff of the mall for assistance. For my eyes, it looked clean and well maintained. If I have more time in the future. I will visit here again.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Although there are restaurants on every floor, the first floor and the top floors have most. Walk to the middle escalators to reach the top floor quickly. Rather than use the other escalators that make you go around in a maze to find them. The silliest thing I' ve seen is floor 3 which is just armies of smart phone sellers. Other than that the mall is a nice mall with a nice looking slick design for the exterior.
This famous shopping mall located in this area for a long time. A lot of restaurants and shops with a floor of mobile phone selling.
A large area of food court with many shops offer and and a nice city view at the window area.
Haning a cinema and karaoke on the 7 fl. too.
Parking are available on their building.
Loved the experience of MBK. A multistoreyed mall with varieties of outlet to do shopping from.
The pricing is not out of the world, and they do announce discounts on the products, so keep your eyes open for sales items.
The food outlets spoil you with choices, and you can go back again to try different places there.
The location is at a busy area of the city and can get really crowded during the peak office hours.
Parking is indoor and available easily.
A good mall that has been revamped and is much better in it' s current incarnation than when it was new. The mall is connected to the Pathumwan Princess Hotel. The mall has sufficient atms and money changers to cater to tourists. One can find shops selling clothes, nail spas, jewelery, salons, themed restaurants, thai restaurants, cafes eg Starbucks, fast food restaurants such as Burger King. A great mall all of 7 floors and you will need quite some time to get through all the shops and all the 7 floors.
MBK centre mall is a vibrant mall with huge varieties of stores and products. Food courts offers variety of eating options. Clothing and shoe shops offer good choice and bargains. But don' t forget to haggle in Thailand.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

There are some good restaurants and a food court on the top floor. Super clean and fancy indoor design. There is a sky walk to Central mall and next door is Phenix mall which is an outlet mall with a good food court and underrated restaurants. There is a BK at the bottom and a skywalk to even more clothing and fashion products in smaller malls across the street. The side streets next to the mini malls have local food restaurants no chain restaurants.
Paradise for shopping! Im from India and Id recommend anyone from India to surely go here for shopping. We spent almost 2 days shopping only in this mall. Its heaven. So many options and variety and very affordable pricing. Please go to each floor and check stuff, then start buying. As an Indian i dont recommend having food from food court as its 99 only Thai food. The one Indian restaurant was selling stale food. Please go out and walk towards pratunam and find proper Indian restaurant who serves fresh and tasty food. They are also Available on Google map. Do not miss platinum mall if youre in Bangkok. THEY DO NOT GIVE ANY EXCHANGE OR ANY TRIALS. BE 200 sure before buying. All the shops have same policy here.
Good place clothing shopping in Bangkok for adults and kids. Luggage shops are many. Food court is on the top floor. Place is neat and clean. Shop owners are friendly. Price is fixed. Higher than road side places. Quality is so so
One of the most versatile malls in Bangkok. For clothes, bags, accessories, etc this is probably the best mall in Bangkok. It' s got many floors and each floor would easily have more than. 100 stalls. It' s not easy to find a store unless one remembers the shop numbers.
It' s priced well, and one can bargain here as well.
It' s no wonder that this mall is one of the ladies favourite in Bangkok.
Probably the busiest shopping mall right now in Bangkok and also known as the Best Wholesale Fashion Hub of Asean. But most of the clothing shops here are repetitive but prices vary depending on your bargaining skills. .!

Weekday quiet. Excellent for those that want to take things slower and not feel too anxious with many other shoppers around. All shops open. . promotions ongoing. . and browsing encouraged. Catering to perhaps a younger crowd. .. .. Combine with all the delights of the surrounding area and convenience of BTS Siam.
as with Siam Paragon, Siam Discovery, Siam Centre shopping mall has a lot to see, shop and to eat with many restaurants, and eating establishments, and while Siam Paragon seems more focused on tourists and big budget spender, this and Siam Discovery seem more focused on more budget conscious spenders, locals, youngsters and young at hearts with more diverse price range products, although i also see lots of tourists touring around in the mall","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

A praying room is available at the basement level near the lift.
Wow this is a beautiful luxury shopping centre. I got myself a laptop a lot cheaper than home. Great service as I was able toclaim. VAT at airport also the salesman gave me a discount from half yearly sales as well.
One of the biggest mall and they have most of the famous brand there and lots of food stalls. All the items are expensive than other local places so you can explore the market and food stalls. If you want to buy branded products you can purchase here
This is one of the more iconic malls in all of Thailand. The area of town is really nice and has several large malls connected together.

When we arrived, the entire river looked golden orange. The horizon has silhouettes of the cityscape and the sky was beige and pale pink. There' s a parking structure that we parked our rented motorcycle. If you purchase anything in the mall, you can either get free or discounted parking. There' s a lot of stores and most of them are either food stalls or restaurants. It has a very lively atmosphere and vibe.
Small shopping center. Not many choices of restaurants and shops. But offers a great view on the river!
Familyfriendly mix of shopping, market stalls, restaurants and coffee shops, theres also a couple of weed shops too. The shops and restaurants are nothing special, Bonchon, Subway, Starbucks, etc, but the main attraction is it has a good waterfront view and promenade, plus a 5 THB river taxi to the Tha Wang Lang pier on the other side.
Obsessed with the vibe of crafted stuffs and chilling with the river view Spent my weekends walk around weekly themed market. Experiencing festive year ends in the winter market enjoying festive coffee, cute decorations, and photobooth. A nice place for weekend revisit!
Perfect destination for grabbing some coffee or a nice meal while enjoying the beautiful river view. Plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, dessert cafe, souvenir shops and etc. Sometimes theres a live music show making the place very lively. They have parking lots available or you can also get here by Chaophraya Express boats, ferries and buses.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

One can spend a few hours simply browsing through all the stores located inside the mall. The top levels are where most of the restaurants are located. You could find many different type of cuisines as well. Overall, this will be a heaven for shopping fanatics. Washrooms are clean as well.
Great mall smack in the center of the bts and metro. Very accessible and a lot of shopping options. Food selections were outstanding and reasonably priced. Definitely worth the visit when you are near the area.
A huge shopping center, cozy, there are at least two currency exchange points. A variety of shops and a large food court.
You can go here not only for shopping, but for the pleasure of seeing a beautiful shopping center, even toilets here are a separate form of art!
Food court offerings are usually average at best, more often than not it' s a mediocre replica. When I had lunch with wifey here, I found it hard to like the food. You can also usually see the reasons why the food aren' t good. Attitude I see tired overworked workers who can' t really be bothered and are robotic in their actions. Already that' s not a recipe for making good food. Food courts are meant to make money, a goal that it places above making good food. In order to achieve that, recipes are standardized so literally anyone with some training can do it. Yes I dislike food courts. Yet I sometimes visit them out of necessity especially if I' m eating with a big group. We can eat together and at the same time pick what we want to eat. Eat to live, or love to eat? Food courts are obviously created to serve the former.
Pier 21 food court is the place well always visit to get cheap thai street food that is hygienic would not cause diarrhoea. Thats the main point wed always come back here theres also other noteworthy restaurants cafes in this building but thats the one wed always come back for.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The Market Bangkok,"111 Thanon Ratchadamri, Khwaeng Lumphini, Pathum Wan, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10330, Thailand",4.1,13.7477612,100.5412712,"Despite the prime location, this place is not crowdy, and still has so many empty space. It seems that the Moxy Hotel also share the same building I came here only for dinner in one of the restaurant in the upper floor. Even the upper floor almost totally empty, only few shops are open
The Market Bangkok is conveniently located with a skywalk connection from Gaysorn Village. Its surprising that its not more wellknown considering its prime location. Despite being a great spot, it doesnt seem to attract many visitors for dining. Additionally, there are some abandoned floors. Nevertheless, I appreciate that they maintain cleanliness very well.
This food place is right in front of the mechanic stairs in the first level of the market. The food is cooked for a sweet lady who cooks the meal in the moment. Very tasty and cheap! ! 100 recommended! !
This May and early June has a book fair with many English books. Thiugh not many business books, non fiction books section will definitely wont disappoint you
This"" Market"" is relatively small when compared with BigC next to it or even Central World right across the street. It' s rather new as some of the spaces were not occupied yet. Still, if you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle found in BigC, you might want to come here and take a look. Oh, btw, the Superrich right next to it not the one inside has a better exchange rate than the ones found inside Central World.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Buy amazing shoes at 500 bhatt, we bought chocolates from first floor. We bought amazing neon tiger print shirt and a lot of stuff. Many Indians are there and they guide you well. Some bargaining is possible. Good quality stuff.
This is one of the best places to buy souvenirs and chocolates if you are leaving Thailand after a vacation. You can find a wide variety of products here at prices that are often cheaper compared to other markets. Bargaining is an option to reduce the price of any product you purchase, but most wholesale shops do not encourage it. It is advisable to check with multiple shops before buying a product, as different shops sell the same product at different prices. You might find that some shops on the first floor sell the same products as those on the ground floor at even cheaper prices. By comparing prices across several shops, you can ensure you get the best deal. If you plan to buy electronic products, make sure to check whether your flight allows you to carry the battery in your checkedin luggage. If batteries are not permitted in checked luggage, you can carry them in your cabin or hand luggage. This is an important consideration to avoid any issues at the airport. Additional information Dont plan to visit the shop in the evening, as almost every shop here closes by 8 PM. Allocate at least half a day to explore all the shops and another half day to make your purchases. Keep in mind that you wont find any original branded products here most items sold are duplicates, first copies, or unbranded. Despite this, the variety and affordability make it a worthwhile shopping experience for tourists looking to bring home gifts and mementos. To make the most of your shopping experience, arrive early and take your time exploring. The market offers an extensive range of items, and careful browsing can lead to some great finds. Whether you are looking for traditional Thai crafts, unique souvenirs, or delicious chocolates, this market has something for everyone.
This place is for shopping and they had variety of shops and this place is mainly for indians and lots of Indians works here. They have almost all the items here. Compare to other shopping malls, this place is good and affordable. I purchased luggage, shoes, accessories and clothes here for reasonable prices. You can also bargain here if youre good at it. If youre in Bangkok you should check out this place
There are lot of shops to purchase. We can do bargain little bit they will reduce. Need to check and buy the quality of the item. Electronics are too cheap here compared to other places.
This place is good for shopping, so many shops and almost all shops have same products. So no point of trying to cover all the shops.
Also you get same products at the road behind Indra square. So good to visit street shops before go to Indra square if youre looking for the cheap shopping.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Best luxury mall in bangkok connected with metro railway. Hygienic toilet and clean all around.
Great shopping mall, not as big as EmQuartier or Icon Siam or the other newer malls but this had enough stores and a few other eating places that would be suitable for one who did not want to be overwhelmed by the other huge malls in Bangkok. The decor for the Asian New Year festival was done quite beautifully. Colourful graphic designs, 3d structures all lent to the festive feeling which we truly enjoyed.
Another luxe shopping mall in Bangkok.
Located just couple seconds away from the Phrom Phong BTS station with direct skybridge access to Emquartier and the Emsphere.
A lot of light, a lot of nice stores and food joints.
A little bit messed up escalator locations, but thats okay, you can just use elevators. And to be honest, halls are a little too tight for a luxe mall. I was expecting something more spacious.
One of the top luxurious shopping malls in Bangkok. A lot of options in here. At a very close proximity with Emquartier and Emsphere. Few yet very selective and quiet cafes too.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Ive been there before many times, this time is for rooftop movies 1. The gallery mall is super interesting, full of galleries and restaurants, even if its a bit pricey. But if staying a whole afternoon and evening, why not? 2. besides the mall, there are many galleries nearby, the streets around 1km, can just walk around Ana explore. 3. The rooftop is comparatively not so special, but the movie I the rooftop made it special. The open space for a movie at night, with the nightview of the river and the opposite side of Iconsiam are amazing. Also the movies are romantic movies. Which is really really really romantic, perfect idea for dates 4. There are still a lot of street food stalls outside, the food is also good, more expensive than normal street food, but good and cheap enough compared to either the restaurants in the mall Recommend to go and explore
Went here for the ATM only, didn' t know there would be art galleries here. And it was a very pleasant surprise. I enjoyed all the galleries so much. If only I have a place to put some of these arts, I would buy some. I especially liked Chubbynida' s contemporary art and their take on a person' s struggles to find their own identity and achieve their goals and dreams. Would love to be back here and explore the other floors.
A mall for art galleries. Very unique mall for those looking for some artistics items even have a Pokmon store! It' s along the Chao Praya river where you can also take a cruise ship for the sunset and buffet dinner place. Tickets are sold here. A few good restaurants selection available here as well. Not too crowded mall.
We chose Wonderful Pearl Cruise for dinner on our TGIF. Overall experience with my first time cruise dinner buffet is wonderful. There was some waiting time at pier 2 before boarding and the weather is warm and non windy on the cruise although we sat on upper deck of cruise as if it moves so slowly. The food on the cruise is great especially grilled prawns and sushi. You can enjoy the night view of Chao Phraya River while eating dinner buffet with your loved ones. There are also great performances with good vocalists and dancers. You can also do a birthday celebration there and the band will sing birthday song for you Enjoyed beer at the roof top bar. They offer happy hour which gives one free bottle of beer for 3 bottles. The view from the root top is amazing. You can see nice views of the river","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Watch out for clothes vendor, they will really scam you with pricing, unless you know how to negotiate. This is a bargain market but then they sell women' s tops for 100USD, I was shocked. There' s also accessories, shoes, fake signature bags, and national clothing. So many to look at and to snack. Make sure you dine in at the food court on the 3rd floor! Amazing Thai food for affordable pricing at its finest!
An old style shopping mall which you can find dresses and jewelry.
Chain restaurants and desserts are also there for your meal choice.
Parking are available under their shopping mall.
Nice shopping mall. On a rain day or hot and humid days, this mall is a perfect place to shop and get food and drinks at
Very classic and classy style of malls. When you visit here, it will make you feel like you are back to the past like 40y ago You can find lots of good and ancient local Thai food and dessert here in 1 floor. Only downside would be car park fee. Quite expensive.
I came here for Thai dessert and snack. Thai crispy pancake Kanom Buang is tasty For me, here is the place where you can find Thai desserts, Thai fabrics like silk and Thai dress price are hight but you can always negotiate a lot of clothes for aunts or grandmothers One of my favorite shop here is the royal project foundation they have a really nice salad, drinks, fresh fruit, and vegetables.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Don' t come here hoping to find fashionable clothes or shoes! ! All my favorite shopping clothes spots in Bangkok are disappearing. .. why oh why? ?? . Bangkok Fashion Outlet my mustgo store for buying nice and discounted clothes from asian brands like Bess, Journal, Nextphase, Easypieces, Britishindia, pieces usually coming from released stock of the Central Stores, unfortunately no longer exist. Also gone the sports shoes shop outlets. The space it' s now occupied by small one man stands selling gems, practically the only thing you can buy nowadays in the building. When I was there two days ago, it looked like the only people milling around apart from the indian vendors were office workers coming to eat in the food court on the ground floor. .. I give it a few months for the building to be remodeled for other uses.
So dead. Nothing to see or buy. Only go there if you need jeweleries god knows if they' re real or not. Quite gloomy and shady atmosphere.
Bangkok Fashion Outlet is a decent shopping destination if you' re looking for branded items at discounted prices, but it does come with its limitations. While the outlet offers some good deals, the selection is somewhat limited, both in terms of stock and variety of brands. One of the main draws of Bangkok Fashion Outlet is the promise of bargains on wellknown brands. There are indeed opportunities to find discounted items from reputable labels, making it a worthwhile visit for those seeking to save money on fashion purchases. However, the range of brands available is not as extensive as one might hope. Shoppers might find themselves with fewer choices compared to other larger outlets or malls in Bangkok. The stock levels can also be a hit or miss. Often, certain sizes or styles may be unavailable, which can be disappointing if you' re looking for something specific. The inventory seems to rotate frequently, so it might be necessary to visit multiple times to catch the best deals or find what you' re looking for. On the plus side, the shopping environment is clean and wellorganized, making it easy to browse through the available merchandise. The staff are generally helpful and ready to assist with any queries, adding a positive touch to the overall shopping experience. In summary, Bangkok Fashion Outlet is a reasonable option if you' re hunting for discounted branded items, but manage your expectations regarding the variety and availability of stock. It' s worth a visit if you' re in the area, but might not be the best choice if you' re looking for a wide selection of brands and a consistently plentiful inventory.
A lot less clothing outlets and more gems shops now in 2024. Still good for cheap sports shoes, and the factory outlet of cheap casual clothes.
The sports outlet is still going well, but the jewelry and gem outlets are now spreading into the 3rd floor zone where clothing used to be sold.
Very bad experience, it is a disgrace that they even call this a Fashion Outlet most shops are empty, only a few stores actually sell fashion, but not much choice and no good prices. I did not buy anything here, waste of time. Took a cab to Platinum Fashion Mall close to Central World. You better go there for fashion.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM

This outlets have lots of fashion n sports brands. .. even have some branded brands that I don' t really see in other outlets. .. . Location is abit far from town but they actually have buses that comes here from Siam Paragon. .. .just have to check the timing for their transport. .. Great Place to come for some great bargains. .
During the weekend, I decided to spend some free time shopping at Siam Premium Outlet. The venue is wellorganized, featuring a wide array of international and branded products, along with numerous food outlets for shoppers to enjoy. I spent the entire afternoon browsing and ended up purchasing some clothing and skincare items. Overall, it was a great shopping experience however, I believe adding more outlets and hosting extravagant sales events throughout the year would enhance the experience even further. Additionally, the information office could better serve a diverse range of tourists beyond just those from Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, who currently receive special privileges. Anyway, the office do give away some souvenir for tourist after validated our passport on first come first served basis which served as sweetener.
Siam Premium outlet is a good place for shopping. Maximum all the brand outlets are present here. They have lot of outlets having food and beverages option also. Its nearby to airport around 1015 mins.
But all the outlets doesnt have good collection or discount. Now a days we get better options and discount online also.
Best things to buy from here are shoe and cosmetics. Clothes and bags are normally priced. The ones in discount are not great. Electronics is also somewhat cheap. Nike Showroom photo and video is not allowed.
It is a good choice when we have little bit shopping time to the flight on BKK airport, around 15 mins from airport. There have many choice of famous brand store in here. Overall the product with various style and some shops have great discount such as Nike. But we need to consider there have sunshine for the outdoor area. We have shoot the video for quick review in this outlet, check it out and support us on YouTube rcenjoylife Thank you so much
Nothing to do on a Sunday. . Woman has destination. .. . Siam Premium Outlets Bangkok. .. I grumbled a tad. I am not the best shopper but I was informed that there was a Starbucks and she wanted to buy me a wallet.
35 minute drive from center of Bangkok, well kept and they had shaded parking available on a Sunday. Layout was as other Outlet malls open and breezy.

High end shops awaited. Overall feel was very pleasant. Worth a visit ofcoyres extremely close to the Airport.
Great place to relax, eat, shop, spend time with family friends ample parking available with dedicated lots for EV charging, most of branded outlets are available they have dedicated play areas for kids to have fun they have decent options to eat in the food village very well lighted and architectured outlets highly recommended to visit if you are in Bangkok
Amazing place to go around with family and friends. We loved walking around and window shopping for almost 3 hours and then went to have a coffee at Starbucks and then my favourite place Mk restaurant. Love the food over here. Cost is not that pinches your pocket. Shopping over here in central village is amazing. If you r lucky you may get things at more then affordable rates.
We went to Central Village on our first day in Thailand. With its wide selection of top brands and discounted prices, it' s a mustvisit destination for anyone looking for quality products at great value. Stores are wellorganized. It' s nice to walk around. Make sure to drop by when you' re in Thailand.
This place is quite big. There is plenty of big brands here as well. Those brand that you will usually see in outlet they have it too. But towards the back of there is quite some smaller or maybe local brands. The big brands do have quite good discount at 80 with choices. This place is quite far from town and nearer to suvarnabhumi airport.
Suggest to come straight from airport or when leaving Bangkok.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM

So many coffee shops and nice salons. Good parking lots and 3 hours free of charge. Really convenient and high end plaza with the 5 stars hotels. Highly recommended to anyone. So many international chains like Berger King and Starbucks cafe.
Great plaza to hangout because they have several restaurants. Kinda small but the layout is simple. I love it because they' re connected to avani riverside and anantara resort, the place I stayed. Other than that, it' s not crowded!
Riverside Plaza and Avani Riverside Hotel are located in the same building. Kinda small but very comfortable shopping mall with some good cafes, restaurants and shops including 7 Eleven, Boots, and Charles and Keith.
Riverside plaza is another best shopping plaza in BKK. Even, Thai popular actress, super model as khun Hana Sexy Mama mentor comes. Another my favorite place where is good ambience. There are many restaurants such as Naiuan Michelin for 3 years, Japanese food, Thai food, Chinese food, Starbucks, The coffee club, Burger king, The pizza 1112, MK, Sizzler, Desserts shop, Swensen and etc. Also, shopping center, Banking and other services.

The mall offers good parking, a nice stationery store, and a main building that' s clean and wellkept. It was calm and peaceful during my evening visit.

This is very convenient for the families of patients being treated at Bangkok Hospital, and even for the patients themselves. It is not a very large area, but it has everything you need. For example, there are many restaurants from different countries, such as Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Westernstyle food, fast food, Starbucks, Dunkin' , and even Lebanese food. Additionally, there is a 7Eleven convenience store open 247, a shop selling fresh fruits daily, and some simple shopping options to help you pass the time. Although the prices are not as cheap as street food, you can be assured of the quality. You can completely relax at this place.
Its a small but packed with multiple restaurants and businesses at this sites. Many delicious restaurants from multiple cruises to choose. My personal favorite has to be the LebaneseIndian restaurant at the highest level. Due to the complex being part of the hospital, it is very clean and well maintained
This is a mini mall with small restaurants, a 711, boutiques, a florist, few cafes, a bakery, and bank branches intended for hospital staff and visitors. However, many nearby residents also sometimes come here to eat, relax, or run errands at the banks. The building is connected to nearby the central hospital department on the 2nd floor. The place has security, is air conditioned, and well maintained. However, the place needs to do something about the HUGE automatic sliding doors because they let out all the cool air on the first floor.
This is a great little shopping mall. There is so much in a small space. It has a good selection of restaurants and so many shops and banks.
Talk about bad service. Oh my gosh. First off I had to repeat myself twice for each thing I ordered. Second, the zombie style staff were totally not on planet earth. They didnt smile, were disrespectful and unfriendly. Third, waited over 10 minutes to get my coffee. Terrible service, terrible staff, and terrible work ethics. Manager, you should darn well learn how to do your job properly and train your staff so that they can respect customers. All the After Yous in Bangkok are pretty bad, but this one is the worst.

The mall itself is unimpressive but clean, featuring restaurants such as Burger King and coffee outlets like Starbucks. While it offers basic amenities, it lacks standout features. Overall, I wasn' t particularly impressed with Nana Square and would rate it 3 stars for its cleanliness and convenient dining options.
Opposite of Soi Nana is the Nana Square mall. It is known to have had better days. Apart from the food, which is actually pretty good and decently priced, it presently is mostly either populated by overpriced knock off shops for fashion, small service outlets like a barber and a bunch of tourist trinkets. I went to help a friend whose visa agent was located here so I had some time to stroll around. As said the food is good. There' s a food court on the third floor and on the ground floor you have a new Prime burger place which I prefer 100x more over the Burger King next door. Parking is the 1st on your right entrance on Sukhumvit. Don' t take the second one as that' s from a bank who not surprisingly overcharges you 30thb per hour for parking.
Perfectly cooked waffle, best I' ve had in years. Either they water down the syrup or buy the cheapest made which takes away from the complete taste. However, I' ll just buy and bring my own because they are worth eating weekly.
Lovely food court on the top floor great local Thai food, real flavours, clean, friendly staff. Recommended! The mall for the rest is sadly quite empty.

Sadly, a pale shadow of it' s former glory. .. and now it' s a deserted shopping mall located opposite the busy Platinum Fashion Mall. I quote"" the photos and videos do not lie, neither do they tell the whole story. ."" Better for you to judge by yourself if it' s worth paying a shopping visit here?
Palladium World Shopping, located in the Pratunam area of Bangkok, is a bustling complex ideal for bargain hunters. The mall offers a vast array of shops selling electronics, fashion, accessories, and more at affordable prices. It' s a great spot for finding unique and trendy items. The shopping center is wellorganized and features dining options to take a break between shopping sprees. Although it can get crowded, the atmosphere is lively and vibrant. The complex is conveniently located near major hotels and public transportation. Overall, a fantastic place to explore for both locals and tourists. Four stars.
The palladium world is a nice place to visit and shop around. You have plenty of options inside and outside for shopping. Christmas time was quite crowded but also well managed and beautifully decorated.
My suitcase was too small for the extensive BKK shopping, so i needed a bigger one. Went to the outside nightmarket and opposite nightmarket, the luggage stalls all start at high price for u to negotiate.
I was too tired to play this bargains act again as they wanted prices higher than big C suitcase prices. So we went inside to try our luck 1 last time and the luggage shop in front of the kfc on the inner concourse was the most down to earth seller we met that evening. Just fair honest prices and non bargaining. U can accept or not, up you mentality
The price she quoted was the best price we got from the evening, so we neednt to think twice! Wrap it up! ! thank u very much
Personally I wouldn' t waste my time coming here as the vast majority of the shop spaces are vacant. There are several floors that are completely vacant and the stores that are open are not that great. It' s a much better shopping experience across the street at Platinum. If you are looking for a massage or dance costumes there are a couple spaces offering those.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM

Expensive, very expensive see video to look at prices. There is a great selection of food, but the prices are much more expensive than elsewhere. .
Whenever I come to Bangkok, I like to shop in this shopping mall. The smallest very favorite shopping mall ammo the tourists. There are a variety of things you can buy and price wise I think it is reasonable. Unfortunately after covid, I am visiting Bangkok, and I found this mall, lost it' s glory. I fell like, there are not much things available in the mall anymore. Maybe it' s a covid effect. Eventually they' ll be okay I guess. When I was in the mall today, I didn' t find many people. The mall was almost empty. There are few people shopping but before it was a busy shopping mall. If you buy at least 2000 baths product, you can get it fat refund from the airport. But you need to endorse your cash memos before you leave the mall. There are three levels. If you come by BTS, you can get down at ashok station. You can park your car there are a lot of parkings available. Also at the underground, you' ll find it super shop.
Great place for some shopping for shoes, bags and clothes, you can get good discounts here too.
Good department store, Very conveniently located, well laid out floors, can get everything for the whole family, plenty of discount on offer less crowded, sports goods were e good, bit expensive but it is quality that matters hence worth spending.","Monday: 10:30 AM – 10:00 PM

Well, it' s amazingly huge and full of food vendors in make shift stalls selling everything that you can imagine from all areas of Thailand.
Unfortunately I had already have a full meal at Wang Lang market near a pier so did not try any of the food here which is quite disheartening. .
Anyway will recommend anyone keen to come and visit this place!
Good market in general.
You can find different kinds of food, from different cuisines.
It gets really crowded though, so most of the time it is quite difficult to find a table to sit if you are buying food from the shops, and even sometimes it is even difficult to walk.
Prices overall are higher than other places, so keep that in mind.
A replica of typical Thai market but inside a mall. No heat, no dust. Clean and hygiene environment. Prices are as expected way higher than regular street food, but you get what you paid for. There ample seating area at UG floor with plenty of access throughout from the stalls area. Payment mostly are cash. Recommended if you happened to be at Icon Siam.
It' s incredible that they were able to squeeze a floating market inside a shopping mall. No more sweaty and stuffy moments, as you enjoy some local street Thai food. Prices may be a little higher than normal, but for the upgrade in experience, it' s worth every bit extra. That said, it can get quite crowded and all stalls somehow look the same after a while. It' s located at the basement of Iconsiam mall, and it' s highly accessible given that you can take either the Ferry, Bus, MTR, or a Grabtuktuk ride.
If you wanna enjoy the floating market or just the night markets in Bangkok without the heat. .. this is the joint to visit. You pretty much get a similar experience as you would a traditional market. It is marginally more expensive but it makes up for a cooler more pleasant experience. I' d definitely recommend it.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Cost is reasonable. I found many local people and foreigners buying clothes there, which indicates the plaza' s popularity.

Nice if you look for jewellery and stones
Worst place to sell your precious gemstones. I believe they operate together to give you a very low price for your gems and rip you off.
For an example, i tried to sell a Royal blue sapphire from Sri Lanka 1. 3ct and most of them told me that they have plenty of ceylon blue sapphires above 1ct and therefore maximum they will do is 350 USD per ct for the particular stone. Most of the stores, specifically the indian ones quoted similar prices.
I was surprised when my friend checked their selling price for a similar stone which was above 1000 USD!
I went to an office outside JTC and sold the same stone for 700 USD per ct. its unbelievable how these JTC people try to almost steal your merchandise. In essense, dont sell here and dont buy from here.
Its not like other shopping centres but this place good for you looking for beautiful stones and Gems. The restaurant is ok.
Good place to buy Sapphire, Ruby, Emerald, Jade, Amber, plenty of semi precious stones and also Rough stones. .Gems lab Like AIGS, ICA, AIG and More. .

A huge selection of furnitures, clocks for 150 years old, camera and all sorts of stuffs inside a house. They have also inside a expensive Rolex shop with Internal Security around and Hermes for a low price. Original gemstones with settings of silver are a lot and Gold diamonds with Citrin Stone and others around 10, 000 baht which also impressive and hard to resist yourself not to buy but fix price. Theirs no way out that you not going to buy anything everything are affordable although dusty outside because of scrap things. This building until 3rd to 4rth floor. A lot are vacant shops inside. Restroom is fine paintings are interesting and something, something their might catch your attention even you don' t like to buy. Public transportation outside is not a problem even taxi. Highly recommended to look and have your fun sight seeing! !
Its name is Bansue Junction. It is a big building and plenty of antique stores inside from oldies can box, statue, painting like Monalisa replica. On the top floor there are plenty of clothing stalls and stores like Tshirt, jackets, slippers, bags and back packs. . This Mall is kind of unique. . When people come to visit Chatuchak market just cross the street from one of Chatuchak entrance can reach the Bansue Junction that is called DD Mall in Google Maps. ..
This building is also known as Bangsue Junction. Antique collectors and seekers this is your place to be! High quality rare antiques, marble statues, antique furnitures, religious statues and artifacts, and so much more can be found here. My personal favorite is a shop named Bygone Era on the first floor. Breathtakingly beautiful and unique furniture pieces, screens, vases!
Really good place for shopping, so watch out ur money
Nothing interesting inside the building. There were just the number of furniture shops. You can conveniently park your car here with reasonable parking fee price. This building is just cross the street distance to Chatuchak weekend market. They also have food court on the 6th floor with a nice view of the weekend market.","Monday: Closed

a bit too dense. feels like the shops are closing in on you.

Bangkok is a shopper' s dream. In this area alone there are multiple malls.
However, if you are searching for uber cheap casual wear then this is the right place.

You can spend a few hours getting lost and roaming the shops.
You can also bargain a bit but the wholesale prices are already really really cheap.

The facilities are great and the staff are really on the ball. They' ve recently upgraded their internet services so now there is one single tier for all users which is great. The gym is fantastic and the pool is awesome, I just wish these both stayed open later or were 24 hours. The breakfast is decent, with a changing daily menu set. The rooms are spacious and have comfortable beds. The shower water pressure can be a little weak but not unusable. I' d definitely stay here again next time.
Overall, we had a very good experience at the Pathumwan Princess hotel. The hotel has recently undergone an internal makeover which makes it feel very uptodate and spacious. Even the hallways are well lit with the carpet a nice soft touch to your feet after a long day of walking. Not sure if it' s because we had the 2bedroom family room, but the rooms felt large and very comfortable. The filtered water was a bit of a head challenge to trust I agree with the approach of reducing waste but it' s the first hotel we have come across that provided essentially drinking water via tap and I' d like to see displayed in the rooms the frequency of testing and results etc. in order to properly trust it. That being said I did try it, and I was fine. We used the pool area a couple of times and that was quite nice although a bit out of date. I feel the hotel doesn' t cater for children very well. There is no playroom much like the other hotels we stayed and no child friendly pool areas. This could be improved if the hotel wanted to attract more families although this may not be of interest as the location no doubt attracts plenty of other people to stay there. I thought breakfast had good variety and the staff at breakfast were friendly. The standout for me was the waffles they were the best we had on the holiday. We had a package with club benefits which we enjoyed 3 of the 4 nights we stayed. I liked the club lounge I felt the food on offer was hit and miss but others enjoyed the food on nights I didn' t. The staff were very good at the lounge. I didn' t like the location of the lounge it felt like a mission to find it but again the staff were friendly and showed us the way. I believe the club lounge package is good value for money and I would book that again if I decide to return.
Our stay at Pathumwan Princess Hotel was fantastic! The location was perfect, and the service was topnotch. The room was spotless, and the housekeeping staff did an outstanding job throughout our stay. We had a minor issue with the airconditioning, but the engineers arrived within 10 minutes and resolved it quickly. Overall, we had a great experience and would highly recommend this hotel!
Has been a pleasant stay in PP since post renovation. Didn' t managed to get my original room with tub, but they managed to transfer the room on the next day. It is good to see hotel moving having more sustainability effort on providing filter water post renovation. Breakfast experience is reasonable but"" wow"" factor is leaking. Very conveniently walking into mall then BTS is a plus. 7Eleven just round the hotel, very convenient.
very good overall. breakfast was good, too. no time to enjoy pool and spa. convinient location. .. I guess not too familiar with the town yet. wish they had a ashtray outside. oh, one thing though, smelled a little late at night in the bathroom. will probably stay again in the near future. thanks.","Monday: Open 24 hours
