SANEH BANGKOK RESTAURANT,"372 Thanon Samsen, Khwaeng Talat Yot, Khet Phra Nakhon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10200, Thailand",4.5,13.7628154,100.4985794,"This joint is perfect. Service is what I would call"" relaxed"" which is my polite way of saying that they are perfectly balanced between not giving a toss and being bloody lovely. Food will satisfy the pickiest of eaters as well as purists, and everything is cheap with free ice and Chinese tea to boot away from the bustling street but not difficult to get to, I literally cannot fault this place and I wish I came here sooner so I could eat every second meal here. As all other reviews say, it works for tourists and locals alike and I tend to agree. I saw a complaint about the smells and smoke from the kitchen getting in diners faces but for me this is a plus without question. I want my nostrils to flare with the choices of my fellow diners to sacrifice tomorrow' s rear end. Plus that old abandoned floating barge is Wak. Tops.
Nice food for a good price. We ate there few times for dinner when we stayed in Bangkok. We never waited for food more than 15mins. Very nice Tom Yum soup!
Admittedly, didnt go for the full divein on this one after recovering from some food poisoning on our trip but took some bits here and there of my friends dishes. Love the location.
Favourite place to eat before 56 in Bangkok. Have come here almost every day for the past two weeks and several times on previous journeys. Every dish I' ve tried here is delicious and fresh. The chefs really have a magic touch.
Prices are surprisingly low for such high quality food.
The best food we had in Bangkok. Tasty, super cheap. Great, chilled atmosphere.","Monday: 7:00 AM – 6:00 PM

But the quantity was kinda less than my expectations. Expensive considering the quantity offered. The kiwi smoothie on the other hand was absolutely delicious and worth every baht! The service was good. The staff is friendly and professional. The ambience is excellent. Their cutlery is very cool.

Another highlight was the vegan stirfry rice noodles, which, despite an initial hiccup with the ingredients, was delicious and wellseasoned. The restaurant also offers a dedicated section for vegan and vegetarian options, which is a thoughtful touch for those with dietary preferences. The service at FOOD UNIVERSE was impeccable.

Speechless! !! !! !
It' s not cheap and it got great points on Googlemaps so we have expectations.
However, the spaghetti is too salty and the shrimp in it is not fully cooked. It' s a little raw. And the fried pork chop is not good either. The noodle soup is almost uneatable. The only notbad item is chips. I saw 4. 8 points and went here. DON' T KNOW WHY it is like this! !! !! !!
Had lunch here seeing the awesome reviews and also since the place is right next to metro station. Service is nice, however, the food taste in general could have been better.

Ate it with rice, some clear Tom yum soup and Phad Thai and finished with a mango sticky rice. Oddly the mango sticky rice was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The mango wasnt particularly sweet but the sticky rice was good. Also my mango shake wasnt all that great. Overall the steamed seafood curry was so phenomenal that despise those flavors its still a 5 food rating. PS loved the deco and environment inside.
The name of restaurant really suits the place as it does make you sit and wonder when look around. The staff were friendly, and the ambience is really good too. Not too loud and not too noisy. The food was incredible as well. The Mango Sticky Rice is amazing!
I love this local Thai restaurant! The decor was such a vibe, with old film cameras and artsy things on the shelves. The chicken pad thai was only 75 baht and was very tasty! The watermelon shake cost 70 baht and that was also delicious! Yummy food, amazing prices, lovely service, and a very welcoming atmosphere. 1010
I stopped in here for a quick, light meal. I decided on Thai iced coffee, some wings and the papaya salad. All three were great! The papaya salad was awesome and as the coffee. The wings were maybe a bit over cooked but nonetheless, had excellent flavour!
2 minute walk from Marriott Hotel. Cute little place. Air conditioned. Thai food. I had the pad Thai which was OK. Only 75 baht. Much cheaper than the hotel. The sweet lemon tea was way too sweet. The iced long black was perfect. Happy with the flavour and strength. I was able to sit here for a few hours working. I enjoyed the energy of the place. A nice amount of people, music was comfortable volume, and people not speaking too loud. Many people seemed to be here for some work discussions. The staff don' t speak much English but are still friendly. The menu has English and Thai writing. Note if your bill is less than 300 baht you need cash, not card. My two drinks and meal was less than 200 baht, thankfully I had cash.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:30 PM

Delicious food overall! Long queue. Efficient ordering system, our orders were taken while in the queue and food was quickly served when seated The restaurant has some nice bohemianlike interior. Boss is friendly and looks like Thaiversion of Bob Marley This is the best food place in Bangkok with reasonable prices and a bohemianlike interior.

The restaurant has a charming atmosphere with seating for around 40 customers.
All good.
Delicious.
Must try.
Very good cuisine restaurant.
No air conditioner but they provide a bowl of ice for cooling. They use broken chairs in restaurant and at the end they give me a stone as a gift.

good food with reasonable price.
the queu is long but does not take lot of waiting time to get in.
the atmosphere is local vibe, not luxury but clean and well organized.
the taste is quite strong kinda salty to someone but will be balance when eating with rice or rice noodles.
highly recommend green curry dish.
1 thing we did not satisfy was the dish we ordered was out of stock but they only let us know after waiting for almost 20 mins.
last order at 8. 15pm and the restaurant closes at 8. 30pm.
A highly acclaimed and widely recognized restaurant that draws a diverse clientele. While the staff was satisfactory, there was a 30minute wait time. However, we took advantage of this by enjoying a leisurely stroll in the vicinity. The culinary offerings were prepared promptly and proved to be both delectable and satisfying. There were no dishes that failed to meet our expectations. Particularly noteworthy were the grandma fried rice and the papaya salad, which we had the pleasure of trying for the first time here and found to be exceptionally wellexecuted.
Prices are reasonable too and cheapish.
The food has a high costperformance ratio and tastes great. The service is fast, and there are plenty of seats. Located in the bustling Siam Square, it' s very convenient and a great spot for group gatherings!
One of my favorite restaurants in Bangkok during our trip, we went here almost everyday. The line could get pretty long, but it goes by pretty fast. They make one of the best fried rice ive tasted in Bangkok, affordable price too!
This is one of my friend' s favorite restaurants in Siam Square. First of all, it took a while to get through the queue since this place is quite popular and busy all the time. The menu is a Thai variation with some fusion and international food. The taste doesn' t seem to be more particular than other restaurants to me, but the price is definitely cheaper, though it' s pricelier than street food. The service is quite great, the atmosphere is alright, and the place is wider than I first thought.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:15 PM

We finally were nearby enough to visit. It did not disappoint. We had only one issue that I had ordered boiled dumplings and received fried but they were still good. Thick dumpling skins.
Not recommended to go at 3pm because the resto closed from 3305pm. I went at 305pm and rushed myself badly. The waitress get off from worked punctually. I had my leftover food packed and left at 335pm. Am not sure because I walked in late or not but the cashier seems cold. Shrimp fried rice has nice aroma from the wok but tasteless and the shrimp is the cheap frozen type. I asked waitress if the combo comes with janjanmian. I misunderstood that it would come with noodle but its not. Another dish is lemon creme shrimp sauce. They use a better quality of shrimp and bigger size. Taste sweet but delish. Better eat fresh cook coz they r batter deep fried. It becomes socky if u pack home. Overall i prefer other dishes i tried before.
There definitely seems to be a hygiene issue. I didnt have to go to the hospital like some of the other reviewers, but I had severe diarrhea all night. .. The food was tasty, but I suffered all night. Im never going back.
The restaurant is run by a Korean. Design is simple and clean. Not many tables but it is full when we went for a Sunday lunch. Water and appetizers are at free flow as the same as other authentic Korean restaurants. The price listed on the menu is net price without surcharge. The dishes are hot and delicious. The portion is very big. The ice cream cooler outside the restaurant is also interesting. The Thai staff provided not so good services. However the Korean is very nice.
It' s just like a Korean style chinese food.
You don' t need to pay for the water. ..
It' s better than Korean Chinese restaurant. .
I actually don' t eat the jjambbong soup whereever I go. .. .
But it' s my first time to finish up the soup twice. ..
It' s really delicous. ..

What a lovely little find! The food was delicious and all cooked very fresh right in front of you. All staff were very friendly and welcoming and the service was great. There is a great menu for vegetarians and we can highly recommend the spring rolls, Mamma Soup Papaya salad! We will definitely be back to eat here again and will recommend to others. Thank you!
Authentic Thai food with super high value for money! Nice staff and services
The food was tasty and the service was l good! ! There was a cute lady that recommend us the top dishes. Its really a good choice for local Thai food experience as they cook at the street. I order the crab dish it was good and the crab was tasty and fresh, the chicken noodle soup was too salty for my taste
After exploring many of the different restaurants in the area we found this on the last night of our stay.

One order is enough for two people to enjoy.
The restaurant has recently been renovated in a retrochic style. I went out for lunch with my family. Normally, I would order Hainanese chicken rice, but this time, I decided to try something different. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my choice because the seafood wasn' t freshit was clearly frozen. Considering the price and the fact that this is a hotel restaurant, more attention should have been given to the quality of the ingredients. For the service, I would rate it 3 out of 5. Compared to the service before the renovation, it was much better back then. The staff used to be very attentive, but now it' s not the same, which leaves me feeling disappointed. I hope that in the future, the restaurant will improve the quality and freshness of the ingredients, as well as the service. If these improvements are made, I will definitely return to dine here again.
Another great chicken rice! My my fav menu is absolutely the chicken rice. The bean also surprisingly good. Their yentafo was quite sweet not my preference. The chicken rice come with huge portion. Which i can share with my mother and both still getting full. Really enjoy every component of it. Good as always. Ps. their chrysanthemum tea was super aromatic.
Nothing much to say it is the legendary place for chicken on rice in Thailand always in TOP 5 best list so you wouldn' t go wrong much here but surprisingly the other dish was nice too so i would recommend to try it out
Absolutely delicious chicken rice, Chinese food and Thai dessert! I love Chicken rice because the chicken was tender, and the rice perfectly cooked. Great value for money. The staff were friendly, and the ambiance was welcoming like home. The chicken rice exceeded my expectations flavorful and cooked to perfection. Will definitely be returning.
The Hainan chicken rice is seriously good, definitively one of the best I ever had. The portion is gargantuan will feed two easily. And if you just wanna try a bit of everything, one order for three persons is sufficient. The roast duck is juicy, and goes well with plain jasmine rice, but not 5 stars. Lacking crispy skin. And I also prefer less sauce on my duck. Dim sum is 5 stars. Very proper hargow, siumai, tarogok, and tofu skin rolls. Revisited July 2024 added hargow photo and tried their braised pork meaty and tasty. One of the best hargow in town. Taro dumpling best in town.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM

The grilled meats, side dishes and cold noodles were all very flavourful and tasty. Service was impeccable, meat grilling was done by their welltrained staff, and side dishes refilled without you even requesting. You only ever needed to lift your hands to feed yourself. The entire experience was so good that my family and I dropped by twice during our 1 week trip. If you want the best KBBQ experience that Bangkok has to offer, this is the place to go to.
A very satisfying Korean BBQ meal! We ordered a beef set 2250 that came with three different types of aged beef, a Korean shabushabu, and various side dishes, including grilled cheese, pineapple, and mushrooms. The beef was tender and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the grilled cheese beef rolls, where melted cheese wrapped around the juicy beef. Just eating the grilled beef alone was filling enough, but we also had the hot pot, mushrooms, and other side dishes. .. and also watermelon after the meal. It was truly abundant! The restaurant is only a few minutes walk from the National Stadium station. The atmosphere is great, and the dining space is spacous even you have only two people. You don' t have to do the grilling yourself as experienced staff will take care for you. BBQ lovers shouldn' t miss it!
Phenomenal Korean BBQ experience in Bangkok, only good things to say! Ordered the Beef Set to share between two and it was perfectlyportioned and wellpriced 2, 350. The selection of meat was incredible, but me and my boyfriend agreed that the ribeye and short rib were better than the brisket. The banchan was very delicious, we especially loved the japchae and kimchi. The cheesewrapped beef in the end is also a delight, but a very rich mouthful! We ordered tteokbokki and it was also very tasty, with a nice seafood taste. The whole process is so smooth the meat is cooked to your liking by the staff, and the banchan refilled without asking. The staff are very friendly and attentive they ask you how rare you want your meat to be cooked, change the grill according to the meat being cooked, and frequently adjust the exhaust fan so there is no oil spatter they provide aprons and plastic bags for your bags, so if there is any there is not a worry. They dont take reservations and Id imagine it gets pretty busy on the weekends, but we went on a Monday around 6 and didnt have any issues. Better than any Korean BBQ Ive had in London, Singapore, and Toronto, so if youre in Bangkok and want Korean BBQ this is a must!
A wonderful well service 2 floors restaurant. The meats are bbq by the staff. As we are eating slowly, the waitress is kind enough to ask if she should stop the bbq and come back later after we finished the meats on the plates.
They are also attentive to you and ask if refill is require when you have finished the side dishes and the sauces.
Definitely worth every penny. Amazing meat selections. Staffs were friendly and they do grill the meats for you. Kimchi tasted really good. Seared mozzarella definitely blew my mind well combined with the grilled meats. Went around 5pm and was a 1 hour waiting time but definitely worth the wait.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The variety of Pad Thai options on the menu was impressive, and the flavors were generally good. However, I found the dish to be a bit too sweet for my taste. After trying other lesserknown spots around the city, I have to say that this place feels a bit overpriced for what it offers in terms of flavor. While the food is decent, it' s not the best Pad Thai Ive had in Bangkok. That said, the service here is topnotchthe staff are friendly and attentive, which made the experience more enjoyable. The restaurant itself is clean, wellmaintained, and provides a comfortable atmosphere, making it a great place to relax for an extended period. However, both tourists and locals may find it quite expensive, especially given the range of affordable and equally tasty options elsewhere in the city. Overall, its a good place to try, but if you' re looking for the best value for money, you might want to explore other options.
I hear the lines are long to eat here. Thankfully my party attended on a Monday afternoon and we were seated right away. At our table we had shrimp pad Thai, chicken pad Thai, and another shrimp dish. No one was disappointed. One may argue theres smaller, less touristy pad Thai joints, that edge this place out but come here for the iconic experience and wont walk with a disappointed pallet. One of the most famous Thai street food restaurant in Bangkok. The queue was crazy when we were there but we were persistent as well. Waited for a few hours just to have a taste of it but there wasnt any regrets. The pad Thai was really the best I ever had. I wasnt really a pad Thai fan to begin with. I felt that the dish was very heavy on carbohydrates and eating too much made me feel bloated. But the pad Thai here wasnt like that. It wasnt as heavy as I would expected. Savory and sweet at the same time. The prawns were huge and fresh. The prices were high based on local standard but I still thought its worth it. At least try it for once but I probably wouldnt want to queue for hours again.
Since 1939, Thipsamai Pad Thai has redefined the standard of Thai street food, serving one of Thailands most famous dishesPad Thai. The original restaurant offers a clean, fully airconditioned environment, making it a comfortable dining experience. The customer service was exceptional, and the food was superb. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish. We even decided to order takeout and bought some meal prep kits to try at home. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is a musttry!

We came to Krua Apsorn twice. It is very delicious, cool space with AC, rich in history, good service. Not very spicy and all ingredients are freshly made.

The saga with black bean and coconut milk was great was a nice way to cleanse my mouth. The crab is cooked well and all the food is affordable. They ave vegetarian options for those inclined to eat that way.
Delicious local Thai food.
Price friendly and the place is very clean.
It is also not crowded. Will come again to try other dishes.

It certainly did not disappoint. Portions are generous and the taste was amazing. The was just ok but the seafood jjajangmyun and jjampong were I visited Aisung in Pattaya and I was so satisfied that I visited Aisung in Bangkok this time.
It was really nice to hear"" .. "" I don' t know about Bangkok, but in Chiang Mai Korean restaurant, most Korean owners leave their seats.
That' s why most people order from Thai staff when they go to Korean restaurants.
As expected, the food was really good as well as welcome Korean.
A couple of 7 and 8yearold kids visited together and ordered 2 ganjjajang, sweet and sour pork medium size, 2 plates of fried dumplings, and yangjangpi.
It was so good to order how good the yangjangpi was.
Every food I ordered was so delicious.
I ordered a lot of food and ate it at home because I packed lots of leftover food, but it was also so delicious.
The staff were also so kind and especially a young Korean female employee I don' t know if she is the boss was so kind.
And my daughter said she is so pretty. Everything was the perfect meal.
Thank you.
We are visiting Bangkok for the first time and craved some jjajangmyun and jjompong noodles and of course tangseuyuk sweet and sour pork. All the dishes were excellent and simply better than the same dishes in the greater Seattle area. The next time we visit Bangkok, we are seriously considering getting a room in this neighborhood for easy access to Isung Found the restaurant on google and decided to try out the food and it was great experience! !
Chef is Korean, all dishes has small size if you come alone or big portion for group sharing. Strong recommend the Tangsuyuk Taste is really good and size is no joke. If you come alone you can order small size. Vibe and services are friendly. And they play all Kpop music ","Monday: 11:00 AM – 8:30 PM

I loved the southern fish curry. It was very spicy but was also very flavorful. I was warned not to order it but Im happy I did. The only disappointment was the mango and sticky rice. The mango was soft but had no flavor. Ive had much better mango on the breakfast buffet at the Mandarin Oriental.
This is my second time. Food superb. 1010 Ask for less spicy if you cant take spicy food. Service very good. Foods and drink served very fast. Atmosphere traditional Thai style design with antique decorations. Indoor with air conditioned and outdoor with fan. Highly recommended. Please make reservation before you come.
The name probably says it, a very local taste with quality ingredients and some rare ingredients from different regions of Thailand. Solid, not fancy, though quite pricey matching up to their Michelin Bib Gourmand. The highlight dish for me was the Massamun beef cheeks which melts in your mouth. The mixed appetizer was a nice little opening adventure. Great atmosphere, a good place to bring foreign guests.
I visit The Local every time I come to Bangkok. It has always been outstanding. Except this time. Everything I had tonight from the lemon grass salad to the curry, to the tea and desert, was overly sweet and unidimensional. It wasnt that anything was bad. The place is still very nice and the service highly attentive. But rather, much better flavour can be found on more humble, often small and plastic, tables just outside.
This place is really pretty and the environment is wonderful. Only issue I had was the service staff, although they are busy, its not right to totally ignore customer and constantly showing an unhappy attitude.
Food was great and I enjoyed it, everything came out fast and hot, which is really good.
But dont think Ill visit again, many other places with much better service to dine at.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:30 PM

Got some local favourites and some unique takes on regional specialities. The crispy noodles were amazing, the seafood tom yum soup is the perfect mix of sour, spicy and umami, the fried kale with crispy pork was well infused with"" wok hei"" . The salted egg squid deserves special mention instead of the crumbly or creamy versions often encountered elsewhere, this version has the salted egg prepared into a smooth, tart and savoury sauce that is very appetising and not overly rich. Definitely will definitely come back!
This is a very old ThaiChinese restaurant that serves homestyled dishes. Mr Saksun, the current proprietor' s grandfather started the business about 100 years ago after arriving in Thailand from Hainan by boat. It is open everyday but only during lunch and dinner hours only, not the whole day. There are two sitting areas, the front section is non air conditioned and back section is air conditioned. Prices of food are the same, irrespective of where we sit. The taste of the food is authentically delicious and reminds us of homecooked food. Service is fast. Prices are very reasonable too. A very recommendable place.
One of the masks around this area food prices is reasonable you cannot miss the crispy noodles. The recipe is over that 80 years ago since King Rama V. The parboil cockles is so good. And the Tom Yum is pretty nice. Aircon room available, if you want.
Small family run Thai place. Its run in third generation since 1966. They still have the original first menu on the wall. Very nice Tom Yum. Well balanced with a touch of sourness. also the deep fried beef and razor clams are excellent. The place has a beautiful old style front room with fan and a back room with AC. Service is very good as well.
If youre looking for an authentic dining experience in Bangkok with absolutely delicious homecooked dishes, you have to stop by Mit Ko Yuan. They serve the kind of ChineseThai cuisine that locals with Chinese ancestry would eat on a daily basis. Most of the dishes have been on the menu for years and the recipes have stayed the same. Their dishes are simple and absolutely delicious. Super affordable. Very causal. A great option for casual lunch or dinner in the old town area. My favorite dishes are their stirfried morning glory and Tom Yum Kung. Im Thai and I can tell you that the way they do it here is the way we cook at home!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 1:30 PM, 4:00 – 9:30 PM

Excellent service that you can expect from a two Michelin stars establishment. I like the main course and their complimentary fresh baked sour dough bread. The special add on menu, the oyster from the chefs home town was creamily delicious. Other menus are creative.
It was a great experience dining here. Great services and amazing view of the city. Food was very enjoyable, especially with the pairing. Great sommelier, who gave us a different wine for the dessert which we enjoyed a lot. Overall, among some of the best restaurants in Bangkok.
My husband and I were delighted with this restaurant. Our friends also admire him
We were kindly given the best table in front of the open kitchen in honor of our wedding anniversary and were also given a wonderful dessert.
The workers are polite, speak good English and are professional.
We visited this place in December, the menu from the chef was magnificent I still can' t forget the dish with sea urchin caviar, avocado and black caviar, and my husband dreams of the amazing Kobe beef You don' t stay hungry, there are many dishes and each dish is special.
This place really deserves two Michelin stars, great experience! Thanks to the boss and his team for the work done
By any measure, Good. Relative to others in the same price range, that is the question! For a start, we would say that you Must do the wine or sake pairing. Without this, half the magic is lost. The sommelier has put some thought into trying to bring out flavours with the wine. That said, some pairings are better than others. The thing we like to look out for is when the resultant experience is greater than the sum of both parts food and winesake. This happened for some and not others. But nothing clashed, for sure. If you' re there with cooperative company, a good plan is to get 1 of each option and share. The staff don' t seem to mind at all and even suggested this. What' s the use in getting uptight about this anyway as we see in some Other places! We had the summer menu. All good. Truffle menu with Black truffles isn' t our thing but that' s just us white truffles are a different matter. Interesting to note katsuramuki cucumbers as opposed to dicon smoke infused Wagyu not just binchotan and not the usual Straw flamed stuff good use of Koji shima
I came to celebrate my girlfriends birthday, we had an amazing experience. The food was outstanding specially with the Japanese twist. I took the Sake pairing something rare but incredible. The service was very meticulous and attentive to detail I will be back for sure.","Monday: 6:00 PM – 12:00 AM

Cold beer, fresh hot food, quick and charming service, and great price we sat outside to soak up some Bangkok atmosphere, which was great for us, but fully airconned inside if that is more you! Well worth a visit if you are in this neck of the woods! Loved it!
Excellent visit food! The place was packed with only few free tables, but they were able to handle the service very fast. Tasty food with reasonable prices. Awesome staff!
Brought the family here for their first Thai meal, and it definitely did not disappoint! It was a good welcome meal especially that they have not had much Thai food previously. Highly recommended if youre in the area. Minor comment the pad thai noodles were not as firm, probably slightly overcooked.
Second visit of this restaurant in Bangkok on July 24.
We arrived at dinner time. .Restaurant was pretty full because has just probably 89 tablesbut we got fast our table.
Our order arrived very fast and had good taste.
Also here u can ask spicy how u like.

Food was so delicious, incredibly tasty! 100 recommend this place if you want a quiet place near Khao San Rd. Super nice staff and very reasonable prices!
Amazing food and awesome atmosphere! I ordered a full meal, chicken satay, chicken padthai and pork minced salad, amazing taste and big portions. The dessert was delicious, banana with coconut milk. I totally recommend this place, thanks for the amazing service as well.
Lovely IndianThai fusion restaurant in the heart of the strip in Chana Songkhram. Touristy yes, but great food with great flavour. Presentation could be tidied up a bit to reflect the quality of the dishes.
The food was amazing! ! The service was fast but I wish they wouldve just forgotten about us. They would often come to clear the table if you only put your cutleries down for a small break. The music came a little too loud at times, regardless the food was amazing","Monday: 8:00 AM – 12:00 AM

Stumbled upon this place while taking a walk after I landed in Bangkok. Very friendly staff. Tried the fried chicken and stirfried shrimp with basil leaves and it was really good. The atmosphere was really amazing and the staff let us sit there almost till 6 am. Would love to visit this place again.
Delicious Thai Isaan food north eastern Thai style. The most interesting dish is Pla Koong which is spicy prawn salad with mixed of Thai herbs like lemongrass and shallot as it has all the kicks of flavours and yes spicy! Larb Ped minced duck meat with Thai spice is yummy with is perfect match with steamed sticky rice. Grilled chicken is nicely cooked as it is tender which goes well with either spicy tamarind sauce or sweet sour sauce. Fried rice with prawn is simply delicious! However, steamed crab is not up to level which I will skip next time. This is more like local street food feeling which you can find authentic Thai taste at reasonable and affordable price.
We arrived late at our hotel and this restaurant was recommended to us. At 10pm this place was packed out with locals eating there, always a good sign. The food was great, especially the freshly grilled fish. Service was quick and efficient. The price was also great. I have no hesitation in recommending this excellent restaurant.

We had to line up, but not for long we were third in line and waited less than 10 min. Staff is welcoming and seems used to foreigners. Venue is a bit crowded but at a cool temperature. Decently sized menu, we enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and green curry with pork. For some dishes like the curry you get to choose between mild and spicy but beware, we found the mild option was still quite spicy. Would come back again!
Fire Penang curry. Can get a good meal for 80120 baht. Fast service at this very busy spot! ! Locals Tourists. They make fresh lime juice too, so I had a lime soda. It was fresh and 60 baht. They have wifi AC fresh coconuts. Dedicated vegetarian menu, too!
Quick and friendly service. Limited seating area. Menu are all thai traditional dish. There' s clean toilet inside. Perfect place to cool down after exploring Wat Pho, before crossing to Wat Arun. The coconut price is cheap, even cheaper than some street seller. Will come back if we are in the area next time. Pad kra pao and pad thai taste good, drinks are refreshing.
Friendly staff, nice cool Aircon to cool down after visiting Sleeping Buddha.
Highly recommend the Thai Egg Omelette see pic! Wished I had more. Thai ice tea was legit tast too. Thai curry was ok but too watery prefer thick gravy. Sweat sour was ok to good. Minced pork rice was nice and spicy.

The staff were friendly and we were usher to our seats without delay. Orders were facilitated even with different languages. This restaurant is endorsed to be 9. 510 by my 83yo Chinese dad. The 0. 5 loss was due to the stir fry kailan with salted fish to be abit too salty. Both of us thumbs up on their mixed meat platter, especially their duck. Simply Mesmerising.
Traditional Chinese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. There are some unusual dishes on the menu such as the pork rib in preserved rice flour, intensely seasoned bacony pork ribs served with a variety of raw vegetables and aromatics as pallet cleansers. My favourite was the braised duck with dumplings. The duck melted in the mouth, just the right amount of gamey taste and very juicy. The shrimp dumplings had very slippery casings but the shrimp. filling was awesome. Great meal at a reasonable price.
A traditional Chinese restaurant in the heart of Bangkoks China Town suitable for killing the hunger after enjoying barhopping in the area. Authentic taste for me.

She did an incredible job picking this location. The food was amazing. The service was on point. Prices are a bit steeper than traditional Thai restaurants, but it was worth it. We had a variety of dishes from BBQ pork sticky buns, shrimp spring rolls, chick3n dumplings, noodles with duck, and fried noodles with chicken.
their food is not bad here, noodle is the most great among all the menu i ordered here, the roasted duck also good too however to talk about their dimsums i guess not really for me, just ok only
and their dumplings is nah, disappointed coz the rice is uncooked inside and not hot at all service is very fast and responsive","Monday: 9:30 AM – 12:00 AM

The food really good, a very good thai food.
We ordered tom yum noodle soup spicy salmon salad sausage crispy pork
All good and awesome.
We will come back here again someday.
Yummy local fare but be prepared to wait. There was a long line of people waiting on a midweek evening at about 5. 30pm. go straight to the counter near the door to get a number then explore the many kiosks and eateries in the area before returning to wait for your number to be called. The tom yam noodle was very good. The pork had crispy skin and comes in big chunks, delicious. Worth the wait.
We were curious to try the food since there were so many people lining up. We took a number and waited about 30 minutes to get a table. We ordered noodle soup, prawns, and fried scallops. Noodles 8. 510
Generous portions with a comforting, slightly sour but refreshing broth. Ill definitely order it again. Prawns 910
Fresh prawns with a mild to medium spiciness and good portions. Fried Scallops 710
I would have preferred them grilled instead of fried. Overall, the experience was great. The service was fast, the atmosphere was nice, and the prices were reasonable. It was not disappointing!
Jeh O Chula is a renowned spot in Bangkok, and after many visits to the city, I finally had the chance to check it out. We arrived around 530 PM and only had to wait about half an hour, which was manageable. The soup base is incredibly unique, likely due to some special spices, and it offers a flavor thats distinctly different from homemade. The place is always bustling with people and long lines, which speaks to its popularity. Its definitely worth trying if youre in the area, but perhaps not worth a special trip just for this. Those with weak stomach, beware! Yes! It' s tom yum noodle u get from the pack. But for some reason, theirs taste better than home cooked. Arrived on a Wed night at 9. 40pm and it was a 2030min wait. Other than the tom yum yum noodle, their crispy pork and raw salmon is not to be missed. I wished the crispy pork was served hot though. 1 thing to note they only accept cash. Finally, if it' s more than 45min wait, I don' t think it' s worth the time. Just move on.","Monday: 4:00 PM – 12:00 AM

April 2024 Absolutely love the fried eggs and fried chicken skin at this restaurant! The combination is divine, and the flavors are unparalleled. A musttry for anyone looking for unique and delicious dishes. The service is excellent too. July 2024 Back with friends so that I can tried more dishes. I highly recommend their fried egg salad
This restaurant is located on the second floor of a hotel, and we were greeted upon arrival. The service was friendly but quite slow we had to wave them down to get utensils and water after our food arrived. Now, onto the food everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! My favorites included 14 Nang Kai Tort, which is chicken skin that strangely tasted like potato chips but was very good 25 Moo Sam Chan, kojimarinated pork belly with excellent sauce and seasoning 25 Pad Gra Pao Nua, minced beef with basil and a fried egg and 36 Yum Kai Dao, a spicy salad with egg and toasted rice that burned my mouth but was impossible to stop eating. My least favorite was 12 Khao Niew, steamed sticky rice, which was bland and slightly too firm. We also ordered a highball and a Sathorn Thai. However, the Sathorn Thai required multiple followups before it finally arrived, and it tasted like just gin and lemongrass because they seemed to have forgotten the brown sugar. After adding the brown sugar ourselves, it tasted much better. Overall, the food was good, and we are glad we got to try it. The total cost for everything we ordered was about 55 USD.
The food was excellent and the service on top! ! We were served by Mr. Guide and the he was just the best help! Would recommend this restaurant to everyone
Shaken, Stirred, and Seduced A Cocktail Masterclass at Asai Hotel My recent cocktail workshop at Err bar in Asai Hotel was a delightful blend of education and indulgence. The inviting atmosphere of the bar, coupled with the expert guidance of the mixologist, made for an unforgettable experience. The workshop began with a brief overview of the history and techniques of cocktail making. Our instructors Khun M and Khun Fluke were incredibly knowledgeable and passionate, sharing fascinating anecdotes and tips along the way. We then got down to business, learning how to prepare new recipe cocktails with melon and dragonfruit. The handson experience was particularly enjoyable. We were provided with all the necessary tools and ingredients, and the instructor patiently guided us through each step of the process. It was a great opportunity to learn new skills and experiment with different flavors. The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the tasting session. We had the chance to sample our creations and compare them to the instructor' s expertly crafted cocktails. It was a delicious way to appreciate the nuances of each drink and to see how small changes can make a big difference. Overall, the cocktail workshop here at Asai Hotel was a fantastic experience. Whether you' re a seasoned cocktail enthusiast or just looking for something fun to do, I highly recommend checking it out.","Monday: 6:30 AM – 9:30 PM

The menu is quite extensive with a wide selection of Western and Thai food. We ordered a simple and delicious lunch of Pad Thai 210b, Oyster Omelette 180b and Stir Fry Morning Glory 150. The serving size is quite generous. Service is friendly. Note because our meal is less than 1000b in total, an additional charge of 3 is added for payment with credit card, on top of the 7 VAT.
The restaurant is good for young generation and salary man. Food Good for all ingredients and simple menus with delicious tast. The squids were excellent including local salad. Service Good in attention and come to ask satisfaction time by time. Location Not really roof top restaurant just 4th floor of business building. We need to walk up until the last step. Quite difficult for senior citizens or who has problems with knees. We will think again if decision to go there.
1st time to be here which followed the review from others. The location is good you can take the train to Taksin then walk only 2 minutes. But parking is limited you need to park somewhere nearby with paid service. The rooftop is nice can see the city view and enjoy the windy if lucky. Or else, you can sit indoor from 1st floor to 5st floor, if you prefer the live band the 5st floor will be good choice. Foods are good you can pick the recommended dishes from the menu list with reasonable price. The drink is and option for beers or you can go with liquor but no wine list.
This is my first stop in Bangkok. Was hungry after getting to the hotel, saw it was close and had a good rating. Amazing. The pork belly was sweet and crunchy. I had the spicy raw salmon dish and wow. Not just a spicy dish, so many flavors like I was hoping, like a spicy ceviche. Last thing I had was the beef curry. Delicious. I didnt get it as the waiter said Thai spicy, but I should have.
Very delicious! Sat on the rooftop bar and the atmosphere was lovely for dinner. We tried out the chinese cabbage, amongst many other things such as the crispy pork belly and pork shoulder which both melted in our mouths, after not having it before, it won over the whole family, so definitely worth trying if you come! Zaw was a lovely waiter and so were all the other staff! Recommend massively ","Monday: 11:00 AM – 2:00 AM

This is real royal cuisine open for public. Taste is authentic full and complex flavours. If you never taste real royal Thai cuisine, please come to this restaurant first. Staff' s maner are very polite as used to work with royal before.
Came here as the dishes were meant for royals. Beautiful dining place and great service provided. Love the deep fried corn and fried fish with crispy garlic. The Chinese kale leaves were too thick for meang kam, better with bai cha pluwild pepper leaves. The red curry with roasted duck is more to the sweet side. The jello with rambutan was good.
Excellent traditional Thai food. I had Khao Cher which only serves during summer months but apparently you can call ahead and ask them to make for you all year round. The downside is the place is an owner' s house so it can get crowded easily and the price is quite high.
Almost can transport you back in time with the setting of a 70s fine dining restaurant. Food is a bit too sweet for my taste and presentation is lacking compared to its price.
For our last night in Thailand we hit the jackpot. This was hands down our best meal on this trip. The restaurant is charming and quaint with a history. It was named in honour of Her Serene Highness Princess SulabhValleng Visuddhi who was once the head cook in the Sumhothai Palace for her sister. We tried three dishes and all three were outstanding. Tofu with basil and chili packed with flavor. Roasted duck red curry they used pineapple instead of lychee. It had a nice hint of sweetness to it. The duck was cooked perfectly. Massaman curry with chicken well balanced and flavorful.","Monday: 11:30 AM – 10:00 PM

Best Korean BBQ in Bangkok! Good meat and lovely service. also not too expensive and the drinks were included.
It was the very first time we had dinner here and I must say it was a delightful experience for both hubby and I. Quality of food was good and service was on point. Will be back again.

Staff were attentive and helpful, checking in on us if we enjoyed the food. It certainly helped in the whole dining experience. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wishes to have authentic Thai food with good service and fantastic view of Wat Arun Temple!
One of the best meals we had on our trip to Bkk. If you ever find yourself near Wat Arun, this is a must go. Big portions, so much flavour, 1010 amazing.
I had a fantastic experience at RONGROS, best food I have ever eaten in my life, The food was delicious, full of authentic flavors, and beautifully presented. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making the whole visit even more enjoyable. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great Thai cuisine!
Special thanks to Iva and the stuff for the welcoming host! Thanks again for all!
Looking forward to visiting you again from the US
Thank you for the nice lunch we had. The restaurant is not as spacy as you think, but enough for 2030 seats at once. Lunch or dinner are avail for a satisfying menu to enjoy with the view of the river and boats. Need to pay attention to the toilet, need more lighting and routine cleaning service. Appreciate the staffs, chefs and waiters for excellent taste, services and the hospitality.

Not street food cheap, but more in line with casual restaurant pricing. The flavors were great and not spicy, which some might appreciate. We had two curries, two pork dishes, and four drinks for 1100 baht. The downside? The ambiancebeing in a mall didnt add much charm, and the service was incredibly slow. But overall, the food made it worth a try!
First time trying Thai food in MBK mall. Despite what other reviews say, I thought the food was pretty good. Papaya salad and morning glory were spicy as hell, but I still finished them because they were super delicious. Chicken wings and shrimp springrolls were pretty good, but a bit greasy. Nonetheless, I thought it was pretty good value for money. I am going back for lunch.
6 ladies meal! The food here is really affordable and very delicious! ! We ordered 5 bowls of steam rice 2 Coke Zero, 1 lemonade, 1 Thai lemon tea, 1 Thai milk tea, 1 tomato juice Shrimp Cake very crispy and fluff Steamed Sea Bass very flavourful spicy sour Egg Omelette not bad, fluff and not dry Rice cracker with dip the sauce is cold and not much minced meat Papaya Salad Refreshing and flavourful one of the best so far! Tom Yum Soup Prawn we wanted the clear soup but it came with the red milky one. The soup was ok. Grilled Pork Shoulder Juicy, and mustorder Stir fried Cabbage in fish sauce could be cooked longer as it is a big crunchy full of Wok Hei taste! Mango Sticky Rice really creamy and nice Red Ruby if you like the ruby tapioca layer to be thinner and the chestnut to be huge bits then this is it! very fragrant! Overall all the dishes are very very good! Must come and must try! 2756Baht
This restaurant has moved from Siam Square to MBK. Tried several in their old location and first time trying it here in MBK. Their fried chicken wings is really crispy and delicious. Other dishes worth trying are the som tam, shrimp cake, steamed fish, fried cabbage and pineapple rice. Highly recommended

I visited there with my Israeli friend.
She has been there many times and I think it means the food is really good.
I actually liked their foods, too.
Tried the chicken schnitzel, and falafel pita. Both dishes were fresh and delicious. The hummus, salad and fries were tasty and food compliments to the meals. Pita bread was soft and delicious.
Traditional Israeli middle eastern food at cheap prices. Been there 3 times now as the food is so yummy!
It might be in a small place out the back of khaosan road, but the hummus is creamy smooth, chicken schnitzel is fried well, and the shakshouska was full of flavor.

The staff is very friendly and attentive, unlike quite a few of the competitors who beg you to come in and then never give you a smile or check on you. Maya, who seems to be in charge there is sweet and personable with many of the customers.
Prices are on the lower competitive side with the rest.
We had drinks here one evening and the atmosphere was fantastic. There was a singer also playing a guitar and he really created a fantastic atmosphere. The cocktails are nice and the happy hour drinks make the prices better.
My favourite restaurant and bar in Rambuttri Village. Friendly and kind service staff and very good food and drinks at reasonable prices. They have the best American breakfast set you can get in this area. Moreover, it' s a very nice spot in the evening to have a snack or drink and watch tourists passing by.
Loved the live entertainment.
There' s also a large screen tv for people wanting to catch up on sports Manchester City vs Arsenal.
Fried crispy fish was ok as was the morning glory. We also had dragon fruit juice and mango juice.
There is indoor and outdoor dining.
The place has a laid back welcoming ambience.
It' s a fun place to people watch next to street stalls and passing traffic including guy driving a very shiny tuk tuk with a large dog in it.
This is a mostly pedestrian thoroughfare but you get the occasional vehicle.

Anyways I will definitely return every time I come to Bangkok.
Our favourite place to eat and listen to all nationalities. Food is Thai Thai Thai and the family run business is quick and fresh. Always had exceptional food at a low price. You are surrounded by massage businesses 3 and a great laundromat. The lady FunFun sells her juice on the corner. But Suda is exceptional. Must try.

Beautifully served, I had to take photos of everything The staff are super nice and friendly, there are cute cats and the place is just a great vibe Also the coffee was the best so far in Bangkok for me
The curry was mindblowingly delicious! ! So many interesting ingredients and spices included. I was in heaven at this place. The staff was very kind and know the difference between vegan and vegetarian. I wish i could try everything. Dont miss it! Its the most delicious thing Ive eaten in Thailand so far.
We absolutely loved it!
As somebody who has severe problems with dairy products and anxiety regarding unsafe foods and drinks i felt incredibly safe with the meals at Mango! I was so happy to have found the restaurant on my very first day in Thailand. I probably went there 34 times.
The food options are amazing and the size of the plates astronomical. You will definitely not be hungry afterwards! Drinks and desserts are also very enjoyable and delicious.
Bonus they had 2 cute cats that were in the front from time to time
I' ve visited here a number of times over the years and have never been disappointed. The restaurant serves healthy vegan food in large portions at reasonable prices. Big enough to share! They also have gluten free options on the menu
It usually gets quite busy after 7pm, so go early to avoid the rush.
Today, we ate banana, gluten free pancakes with coconut ice cream, cruffle with fruit, coconut ice cream and chocolate sauce. Fruity som tam.

The best street food in Khaosen road.
We arrived here at peak dinner hour. However, the staff were helpful in getting us a table promptly.
Contrary to other Street vendors, their menu is really limited but made us wish we order every item.
Served on a cute bamboo platter, each dish is adequate for 1 person and hence priced accordingly. Quality, hygiene and taste was top notch.
You can enjoy the hustle of the Khaosen road while enjoying your meal we also enjoyed live music from next door cafe.
Must recommended in Khaosen! !
The Mixed Fried Rice is excellent! Their shakes are also amazing we got strawberry, passionfruit, mango and they gave me a whole coconut! Still not sure if that was supposed to be made into a shake instead of sold whole We also got a squid fried rice and a spicy pork basil rice thing. While it was all delicious my american taste buds were not ready for thai spicy.
The mango shake has bland taste. Pad thai was okay. I can get a better shake from other the stand on the same street with the same price.

I would say this should be a Thai restaurant that surprises me THE MOST during the trip half of the trip now lmao

We visited the place during lunchtime, it' s beautiful. The food is good and affordable. It' s more beautiful and romantic during sunset to dinner because of the lights surrounding the area, the bridge and band music.
Staff are nice and accommodating too. visited Monday, 7pm.
Sold out dishes Crab w Vermicilli, Small Crab w curry powder. River prawn small Ordered
1 Chef Recommendation Vermicelli w prawn and veg. Super dry and unflavourful. Look at photo.
2 Tom Yum Soup taste like Salt water, very little herbs used. absolutely disgusting.
3 Salted egg yolk squid Overdose of garlic. no salted egg taste. squid texture acceptable.
4 Chef Recommendation Crab Omelette Super dry. yucks. Overall. great views 55. Great live band, volume just nice. Great place for drinks and finger food but not for serious dining.
The location next to the river is great. There is live music. Service is friendly and efficient. The decor is practical and with high ceilings. Check the weather for rain. Book the Aircon room if it is going to rain. You can still get photos later. Food is average. Check the freshness of the river prawns.
I was really looking forward to visiting this place, but unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. Some friends from Thailand had recommended it to me for my birthday, so I made a reservation. However, the service was subpar. They asked if I was alone, then moved me to a table by the side, took ages to take my order, and never brought me the bill, even when I requested it. They also mentioned that if I' d booked through Facebook, I' d get a free dessert for my birthday, which seemed odd. It felt like they prioritized tables with bigger groups, which didn' t align with my expectations of Thai hospitality. The venue itself is lovely, and the ambiance is great, but they could improve the service to make it a better experience for customers, especially solo visitors like myself.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 12:00 AM

The server receiving the order was very kind. It was good because it was cheap and tasted good. Stirfried Morning Glory and Pad Thai were especially delicious. But I was disappointed that the shrimp in the fried rice smelled a bit fishy smell. You have to eat Tangmo Pan no matter what.
We came in for the mango sticky rice as it was late and at least we had a place to sit, the prices were great the mango sticky rice at 50 tbh and the large beer at 100 tbh but the portion of rice it was extremely small and half mango only. We came the day after for some smoothies and if youre coming for a smoothie here be careful as they are using syrup instead and not fresh fruits! ! One of the smoothies had two syrups and yogurt and you can clearly see on the photo the final result and when we asked him how much it was he wanted to charges more than what it was and it was not even done with fresh fruit. Go better in the front stalls they have proper fruits for the smoothies and mango sticky rice at the same price with better portions. During the night it was quite unpleasant it was this young Indian guy all the times with the laughing balloons which it was pretty annoying.
Amazing food on khaosan road, the lady that works here is very friendly and even helped to get a group of men away from us, if you are staying near khaosan road I definitely recommend here. It is open late aswell which is amazing. Amazing authentic Thai food that accommodated to our dietary requirements of being vegetarian aswell. Couldnt recommend more xxxx
Cheapest meal I found on Khao San Road, and I got what I paid for. The noodles were fairly bland and didn' t come with lime or sprouts to help. The egg white wasn' t fully cooked, but there was nothing offensive about the the flavor and chili and peanuts were at the table.","Monday: Open 24 hours

It was by chance that we visited there, so much surprise, in a hidden place. Authentic Thai food, many choices, very welcoming service. All the dishes in the pictures are fully recommended. Its an address to be saved.
Small but cute restaurant nestled away from the main road. I order the pad Thai, spicy papaya salad, and passion fruit smoothie and they all tasted great! My server was friendly and chatty which was nice whilst solo. Would highly recommend refueling here after a class at Thanomsak Boxing Club around the corner!
Off the beaten path, a really good surprise. Simple but delicious food. All the classics of Thai cuisine in a relax atmosphere.
I came here with my family and everyone was so disappointed Even the manager was very kind, he forgot our order two times and theres only one person who was cooking for everyone and she kept talking with other employees and neighbors while some customers were waiting for a long time. Tom yum noodle was good but others were just okay. Oh smoothie is very good!
The place I aimed for was closed so we came here as a second option and I havent checked the menu previously as I usually do, being vegan I like to know what to expect. The menu was in pictures, hard to understand exactly what is what, but the waiter is glad to explain and give recommendations. I ordered a vegetable fried rice without the egg, he asked if i wanted tofu with it always nice.
Food was good, nothing crazy, but not too fatty, good size portion and I really enjoyed the atmosphere!","Monday: 10:30 AM – 8:00 PM

The food was excellent! The shrimp pad Thai was perfect texture and delicious. Chicken curry was sweet, rich and creamy with coconut flavor. The pineapple pork fried rice was a large plate with generous portion of meats, nuts and shrimp. Excellent choice! Perfect finish with mango sticky rice.
A good restaurant if youre looking to try some very unique and interesting flavors as well as some of the most popular dishes from Thailand for very decent prices. Very tasty food available for dine in or takeout. Cert refreshing drinks. Highly recommend the watermelon. Green curry is very tasty too and theyre nice about adjusting your spiciness level. Friendly, fast and efficient service. Available also in Thai and English. Payments accepted with cash or some payment app, no cards. Reservations might be needed on weekends, during busy season. Only 5 tables inside. Handicap friendly and wheelchair accessible. Parking is safe and easy nearby. Printed menu. Vegetarian options available. Restrooms nearby on site. Indoor seating only, with AC. Great WiFi, free with password at table.
Its a really pleasant and cozy place to be in. There are literally 6 tables in this restaurant. It is ran by a family. The food was really nice and fresh, however Tom yam which Ive had, was a bit too sour compared to the ones I had around Thailand. But overall great place with a great vibe and really good food. I think the payment here is also cash only so if theres any downside its that. But Thailands motto is cash is king so no surprise there. Definitely worth a visit and try. The prices are also very ok!
Delicious! Pad Thai was great but it was kinda spicy for me. Will definitely go back here.
Nice food, the waiter was really nice with us! The spiciness of the food was perfect for us! Soups, appetisers and even the bacon carbonara was really delicious! I would definitely recommend this place for you!","Monday: 10:30 AM – 4:45 PM

Highly recommend to anyone looking for top quality, authentic food in Thailand.
The food is amazing, among the things I ate here I must say that the Tom yum was one of the best I had here in Thailand. Staff is friendly and nice. They could improve the bathroom tho.
A good restaurant a combination between Thai and Indian kitchen. The food was tasty and well seasoned. The papaya salad was little bit to spicy to our taste. The stir fry vegetables with cashews were amazing. The panang curry with shrimps was also great. The chicken curry was also nice. Overall a great experience.
This little street food location is absolutely what you were looking for. After landing in Bangkok and leaving the hotel for the first time we found this little kiosk that serves typical Thai food. The shrimp pad Thai is breathtaking and the sweet and sour chicken keeps the pace well. Location is immersed in a very local set and service is nice.

The drinks' prices were reasonable. He food was a bit on the pricier side of what you can find in the area, but it was tasty. The venue is the best part. It' s really welcoming and relaxing.
I can' t say enough good things about So Samsen! From the moment you step in, you' re greeted with warm smiles and an inviting atmosphere. The authentic Thai cuisine here is simply unparalleled. Every dish is bursting with flavor, from the spicy tom yum soup to the perfectly balanced pad Thai. The ingredients are always fresh, and the presentation is beautiful. The staff at So Samsen are incredible. I come here quite often, and they always take amazing care of me. They go above and beyond to make sure you have an exceptional dining experience. They' re attentive, friendly, and always ready with great recommendations. The ambiance is cozy and perfect for both intimate dinners and larger gatherings.

The owner is really kind and friendly, would definitely recommend! !! Price is also very cheap, would definitely come back!
This is a Korean restaurant that is a gem in the Khaosan area. It is said that it has been in business since 1995. If you want to eat real authentic Korean food, definitely go to this place. It is Korean restaurant common manners that when you order a main dish, many kinds of side dishes and soup are provided free of charge. I enjoyed grilled mackerel in a cool, clean atmosphere in this restaurant.
Bangkok has incredibly delicious Korean cuisine, very tasty and cheap! ! A very cozy place with a good atmosphere

The owner is super nice guy. You get the appetizer in the form of a tiny bowls of veggies and kimchi, which is very good and filling.

They have Hokkaido beef, Aussie beef and river prawns etc. very into detailed thats using different containers to classify the cooking methods. Oysters are also fresh. Drinks and desserts are also nice. Tables are set with distance which provide a cozy experience.
Great experience, booked on eatigo with a discount so makes it much more value for money!
Great atmosphere, very nice decor!
Staff super friendly and happy to serve both chefs and wait staff.
The cook to order seafood and meat is unreal!
Fresh and cooked perfectly.
I wish there was abit of a larger range of cooked food. Korean oysters was abit of a letdown. Fresh but not so tasty.
Nonetheless still great experience!
Very good value for money booked through Eatigo, staff were very friendly and helpful, lots of seafood and beef choices, plenty of Thai food options as well.
Really liked the juice bar!
Certainly will come back again in the near future.
I booked through Eatigo that gave me a deal! The staff was thoroughly helpful from booking to bill payment. They were very prompt to clear the table too so we can bring in more dishes. Kudos! Ambience was wonderful the seafood wall was the most notable, followed by the dessert spread and the juice corner. Spent under 3, 000 Thai Baht for 2 pax on a nice Sunday afternoon. This is the place for wonderful seafood buffet!

I value a good meal and it didnt disappoint. My Pad Thai was delicious, the portion was big and the price was very fair! Many traditional Thai food options. I would come again, great local eatery option if you are in the area
The restaurant has received good ratings, partly due to a promotion where customers are offered free mango sticky rice in exchange for reviews. Additionally, many of the positive ratings seem to come from Western customers who may not be familiar with authentic Asian or Thai cuisine, leading them to perceive the food as excellent.
Remember when food used to be uncomplicated and simply delicious and fresh without the pressure of having to be social media worthy?
Well, here you have it. I have been so tired of eating out and I came across this place late at night after watching Muay Thai fights. I was a bit skeptical due to being in a calm dark alley, but Im glad I trusted the reviews. I had young coconut milk smoothie, chicken satay and papaya salad. Everything was delicious. The smoothie took me by surprise, I didnt expect to like it this much.
Give it a try they also have English translation on their menus a huge plus for me. Only negative is no AC. But they have plenty of fans on.
The food came out quicker than expected, I would say within 5 mins for the spring rolls we had and 10 for the pad Thai! Absolutely lovely staff and the mango shake was delicious. For our first Thai dinner in Bangkok it did not disappoint!
Was close to my hotel and tried it out. It was a great experience. The fried chicken was absolutely delicious, red curry was very fragrant and not too spicy as well. Recommended to all.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 AM

If you' re in the mood for a laidback evening of Korean BBQ, Onkijung is worth a visit for its inviting ambiance and flavorful signature dish.
Very good Korean restaurant! Delicious food! Quite spicy for all the dishes. Very polite staffs. The ownermanger comes out to serve the food himself. The limited dishes for 2 people here look amazing! They are super huge, but we did not order.
They serve a variety of korean food. mostly rice set and don.
however, the highlight would be hansang bbq pork set if i remembered its name correctly, which only served for the limit number of set per day.
the set was very good. bbq pork was delicious. the set even came with water and bingo. it was a good refresh after the meal. the place was clean, organized and cozy. the staff was polite, friendly and very helpful the price was very high around 500baht per set, but it came in big proportion.
A modern Korean establishment hidden in the top floors of Central world. They have over 10 branches in Korea and the first one in Thailand. The atmosphere was comforting and casual. A great choice for a fast meal for 24 or even solo. The taste was sharp and refined. The variety the sauces, and the components were fun and enjoyable. The kimchi was the best, not only the taste which incorporate saltiness but also the sesame oil which makes it so appealing. I cant stop eating kimchi here!","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM

Very broad choice of food grilled, steamed, fried and wok. All sorts of currys, fried rice, vegetables, grilled meat and fish. Boutique style, big but still cosy. Very friendly staff. And awesome cocktails and mocktails. Definately will come again. Bit more expensive but worth it.
I' m an Italian chef working in phrom pom, this place it' s a tourist trap! !! The atmosphere wasn' t so bad, the location great! Everything from food and drinks are overpriced storebought junk food, the spritz were watered down, only two draft beer, with only the boring one available, this is clearly a scam for foreigners.

I' ve had yellow crab curry at many other restaurants but this one is the best. The portion size is also very big a small is enough for 24 people. The other dishes are also good but not as special as the crab curry. I like to come here for the curry and skip the rest of the menu.
One of the best restaurants in Bangkok Ive tried!
For the hot plate oyster omelette, its just so good! The omelette was tender with good smell from onion and white pepper. The oyster was juicy and fresh, the best oyster omelette Ive tried in last 3 years!
The curry crab comes with a lot of sauce, you better order rice to mix with the sauce. Its not spicy at all so you can feel the freshness from the crab! The taste is not heavy, its right amount of softness, definitely want to try again!
Pork rib is just okay, not bad and nothing to shout about.
We enjoyed our dinner here. It was extremely busy so recommend making a reservation. The curry crab was delicious, as was the kangkong. The prawn beehoon and river prawns were quite fresh but not our favourite, perhaps due to the different flavour profile. Overall we thought pricing was fair, way cheaper than Singapore for the quality.
Waitress or floor manager helped me pick a meal big enough for 1. Portions very big. Very flavourful and worth the price. The grab curry plus the green chili sauce makes a perfect combo. Would definitely go again. Fish, curry, rice and beer for 33.
Crab meat curry and oyster omlette! !! ! No one will be disappointed with these. Service is a bit like they are tired of all these people coming for their food. Like ok but not super happy to have you. Even when the dining hall is half empty. But crab meat curry is worth this grumpy service experience.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM

Some of the dishes were excellent, with the star of the show being the papaya salad with blue crab. The shredded pork noodles felt a little bland in comparison but overall this place has a huge array of authentic Thai dishes to choose from at a great price. The noodles with mackerel were also another table favourite. The only downside is food is brought out when ready and placed on the table without being told what it is, so it can get a little confusing trying to workout whose dish is whose. Ill definitely be back to try more from this menu.
Unusual dishes but they tasted so good. Every dish we had was excellent. Very busy but informal. Can see why it is a Michelin guide regular. Price was fair and we tried a lot of food from the menu as it was one of the more interesting ones we came across in Bangkok.
One of the best Somtam I tried in Bangkok. young coconut with shrimp somtam tastes very subtle and spicy. Yet, all the gentle sweetness, sourness, saltiness, unique smell of fish saucenot the funky type are all there! their signature somtam also uses the fermented fish brown color sauce but it literally helps bring your dead appetite back to life! !! Must try the gengsom? was also very spicy and good. Overall, the food is amazingly good. If you are not good with spicy, please ask for level 1 spicy! Michelinawarded shop, though, I was able to have a seat without booking, maybe it was a bit late hours and also shop has many tables.
Mood is very good. especially the sounds of crush nuts and hot peppers made good BGM. There are so many menus with reasonable price.
Papaya salad is must.
Also I loved coconuts icecream which tastes very thick.
I will definitely come back!
One of my favourite restaurants in BKK.
This was my second time visiting, my first being about eight years ago.
Since then they have renovated the restaurant and became apart of the Michelin Guide congratulations team! .
I did not know this before we arrived, so it was very busy.
I asked the host if I could drink a beer outside while we waited, which he said yes and bought it out to me We only had to wait for about thirty minutes before a table was available. The food was delicious!
Our whole fried fish was cooked to perfection and the som tum was great with an awesome amount of chilli. We also loved the crispy porkrice entree and the corn salad this had fish roe in it which was a nice surprise! . The service was great, every staff member was working hard and they were all very nice. The restaurant has great air conditioning, it was extremely clean and good bathrooms. Everytime I am back in Bangkok, I will always visit this restaurant. Aroi mak mak!

The food was nowhere near as good as last time. The Red Curry that I ordered was pretty pale and not creamy. It was really nothing special at all.
Came here for supper after landing in bangkok as it was near our stay. As it was nearing their closing time so there were limited dish left. However, it was good enough! The crab omelette with curry powder is a must! ended up ordering 2 more portion of the same omelette because its so good. Their orange juice is 30 baht and its quite good as well located in the alley of the noisy street, this place is definitely a hidden gem
Super tasty Thai food at reasonably prices! ! We ordered Fried Snapper with Chili Sauce and were blown away by the crispy texture and the sour and spicy taste! Such a nice and appetising dish for hot weather! The coconut chicken soup is the best one Ive ever tasted. Its made of fresh coconut juice, instead of coconut milk its light and has natural sweetness! This place is a hidden gem in Sukhumvit area where you can taste authentic home cooking Thai food at good value!
Located in a small alley, this restaurant seems to be popular among the locals and tourists. Ordered a fried fish, pai thai, vegetable, crab omelette, plain rice and the total price was 600 bhat which was reasonable pricing for two person. Do check the pricing of the fish as it is not listed in the menu which I assume is seasonal price. Additional info There' s a resident cat but it' s not really that friendly. I was looking on Google Maps and found this wonderful restaurant. I was staying down the Soi at Hopeland Hotel and decided to give it a try. I met my daughter and her coworker for lunch. We had shrimp pad thai, chicken pad thai, green curry chicken spaghetti, and papaya salad. The food was delicious and I highly recommend this restaurant.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 11:00 PM

Such a beautiful place, making us all in awe when we first came D The service crew were very friendly and efficient. Food came really quickly and our drinks were constantly taken care of and refilled promptly. We ordered a large range of food such as steamed fish, tomyam, the ribs as well. All were delicious
Rare Thai historical food in modern style. The foods have almost balance taste. If you have fixed idea about thai taste, you will have question about these food. Overall the taste was good with homey atmosphere and good service. Open your mind and enjoy the food.
Their short rib was very good easily one of the best in town competing with much more upscale eateries. They also have a Thai menu and we tried the appetisers and they were all very good indeed. Staff were passionate, friendly and knowledgeable about the food they served specially Anil. It is not everyday that I come across staff like him. Overall Id highly recommend this place.
Cute little hidden gem, in an older colonialstyle building. Good food, though service wasn' t that great. We' d ordered four dishes and they' d mistakenly served our last dish to another newer table, so we wound up waiting an extra 15 20 mins after finishing off our other dishes which marred an otherwise good dining experience. Knocking off one star for that, unfortunately. That Tom Kha was top notch though!
Thank you for your Surprise experient. Your restaurant' s name similar my family name too. Thank you for recieply surprise thai style BIRTHDAY cake and lovely complimentary sweet dessert. Very surprise for i never heard many many menu and so delicious. We will going back SOON.","Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:30 PM

Although the portion of the noodles are quite small, but the meat whether you order chicken or grill pork collar, its absolutely stunning. Very unique flavour and tender to the mouth too. Services are quite good as everyone here is attentive.
Ordered Pad Thai w White Shrimp Pad Thai w Signature Iberico Pork. The pad Thai is absolutely delicious and the shrimps are huge. The pork is great, and the skin is really crispy. However, youll get sick of the crispy skin easily. Portions are small and leave you wanting more of the Pad Thai noodles! The interior is also pretty cool and slightly retro. If you have to pick 1 dish, go for Pad Thai w White Shrimp!
I had Iberian pork jowl.
1st impressions this is soo tiiiny! ! And expensive!
1st bite just take my money, this is of the best pork I' ve ever had, this dish just switched my brain off. It was so good I ordered a white shrimp pad thai next this was real good as well! The shrimp was like caramelized and very good, but still. .. The pork was unbeatable. . like how is this pork. .. Just, just no words. Amazing gastronomic experience. I am still shocked at the quality of what I' ve just had. ..
Absolutely delicious. Unique flavour profile for pad Thai. Not surprised they keep getting Michelin recognition! On a Saturday night at 830, there was plenty of seating. Pad Thai portions are on the smaller size but still sufficient for a meal. Prepared super quickly. A bit spicy. 130 baht, but this was one of the cheapest things on the menu.
A Pad Thai restaurant around Democracy Monument area. The quality of foods was good. Using fresh quality of pork jowl, crispy pork, and shrimp. Pad Thai was tasty. Attentive service.","Monday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 AM

The portions were generous, but the flavor was just okayIve had better. The place wasnt too crowded when we arrived, with only two other customers. However, I was a bit disappointed that the owner rushed us out, saying she was expecting more customers. We had ordered a lot and hadnt been seated for long, so it felt unfortunate. That said, it was still worth trying, especially since they offer good vegan options. Also the price is relatively cheap.
We came first to have the green curry for dinner, which was spectacular. As a Brazilian I had to try the mango smoothie, it was so good that I had to return to have lunch.
It was equally great, we had pork omelet, fried chicken with cashew nuts with rice and fried egg.
Were going to be back to try other dishes at Jeng Noodle, for sure its going to be always a tasty experience.
A restaurant that uses five ants for seasoning.
A restaurant that urges sales and obsesses under the guise of laughter.
It' s been less than 10 seconds since I sat down, so I' m not ordering quickly.
It' s a good restaurant that allows you to clean up your plates and pay quickly before the meal is over.
It is a restaurant that turns off the fan and saves electricity as soon as the spoon is put down.
Due to the nature of the president who prefers white people, it is a restaurant that offers all kinds of items to other white customers, from menus in front of the table to tissues.
A restaurant that allows Europeans sitting on paddy fields on other tables with many seats to sit down to evict other customers.
It' s a good restaurant with lots of bugs and fly mosquitoes.
It was the same when I visited for the first time, and when I ate with my friend, the owner let me use an umbrella and delayed it for more than 10 minutes without the customer' s permission even when the customer had to move.
There was no apology at all, but rather, the old grandfather' s owner got angry because he got rained on.
The owner' s wife acts like she takes it for granted.
a restaurant that avoids Asians and prefers white people.
If it' s okay to receive this service, it' s a restaurant I recommend.
It would be good for visitors to refer to it as a must.
This is a great little place for some quick, easy, tasty and cheap food. The staff are very friendly and food is cooked and served really quickly. Beers are nice and chilled and they have a good list of other drink options. Some of the reviews here are judging the place with the wrong criteria you want top gourmet Thai food? Go and pay top prices somewhere else! ! Duh! All of the dishes we had were very tasty all vegetarian and the Papaya Salad had a nice spicy kick too! They actually have a completely separate menu for their vegetarian choices how cool is that? ?
This was our second time here and food was not disappointing, on the contrary. It was amazing specially the soup.","Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:30 PM

It' s a small business run by a family with just a few employees. Don' t miss their signature grilled pork dish, served with fresh vegetables, side dishes, and Gochujang sauce. While other menu items are good, they often blend in Thai flavors to cater to local tastes. If it' s busy, the food might take a bit longer. The staff, mostly aunties, do their best to take care of every guest.
This Korean restaurant located along the extended Khao San Road, known as DongDaeMoon, is truly authentic. The owner, originally from Korea, imports a diverse range of genuine Korean flavors. The variety of dishes captivates tourists who can' t resist walking in. While the threetier pork buffet might be overwhelming, opting for the pregrilled option is recommended. After indulging in the extensive menu, the fried chicken brought to the table is a musttry succulent, crispy, salty, and sweet. A visit to this place, tucked away near Rambuttri Alley, promises a delightful Korean culinary experience with reasonable prices. Highly recommended for those seeking delicious Korean cuisine while exploring the Khao San area.
food is soooo yum and they gave us a few things to try for free! so sweet and nice family atmosphere. fried chicken is incredible got two orders
For this one is good for buffet 290bathpax exclude drinking. I had tried only buffet here never tried a la carte before. I was here 2 times with my best friend. The sides which come along in buffet is not that bad 3 sides and you can feel it unlimited. Buffet itself has only fat belly pork which you cannot put any sauce on it while you are grilled it. I am not sure if that point because the staffs are lazy to clean or that is a rule as my first time I met with owner, he saw that we put some sauce on fat belly pork on the pan. He said how do you know to do that? I said my friend was made me once in Korea after that the staff came to blame us that you cannot do that. It still on my mind until now. For a la carte I think you should try another Korean restaurant which not far from this place.
the first time i visited this place, i got to meet the owners. they were very nice and welcoming. the food servers are also very accommodating. the food is great! i especially love the side dishes, the fried chicken, and japchae. ","Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM

The Tom yum soup was great and it tasted really good, the fish dish we ordered didnt taste good at all, could be that it was my first time here and didnt know exactly what to order. The service was slow, took some effort to get waiters attention although the place wasnt as busy as how you would normally see it. Might try again
Decent Thai food inside central embassy mall. Not as busy as other locations. Vegetarian friendly. Deep fried taro is my fav.
Authentic Thai fare in a nice restaurant located at a high end mall Central Embassy. Good variety in the menu to select from. Our all time favourite is the beef green curry platter, absolutely moist slices of beef in a delicious green curry, served with vermicelli, cucumber and bean sprouts. Chicken in white coconut broth go so well with rice. Overall an enjoyable meal at slightly higher prices, but worth it. thaifood bangkokrestaurant

Updated they have made the restaurant brighter with new light bulbs! I' m glad I can see better my delicious food better now! In the basement of the Grand Hyatt is a dimly lit wished it was a tad brighter! restaurant that serves up good local dishes. My favourites include the boat house noodles and the Tom yum noodles.

Every single dish was a delight to the senses. Yes, every single one we ordered. Will definitely return. Crab meat fried rice skillfully made, generous wok hei, rich buttery flavor. Steamed sea bass very zingy refreshing flavor. Shrimp stir fry, spicy crab meat stir fry, shrimp glass noodle, seafood tom yum, fried shrimp with fried garlic chili salt. All beautiful fresh.
Its the second time I eat here, the first time was in 2022.
Food is of good quality and freshness. Price is not very cheap but I would say its value for money for sure. We went back again for lunch on the last day of our trip.
The cabbage is the plainest looking of the dishes but it is surprisingly good that we ordered 2 portions.
The fish sauce fried fish is a must order! The food portion here is considered quite small
The steam crab is the only item I feel can be missed.
The restaurant served their food pretty fast which is a plus point.
Do make reservations online or pop by before u start your shopping.
For many years, always the fried cod. Attentive staff you can depend on, even for advice on the next destination. But atmosphere is not a replaceable experience. Like this home away from home. Comfort. Wish they could up their Tom Yum game a bit to seal the game. ..
